      <caption>
          The two kinds of reproductive prints in the 18
            <sup>th</sup>
            century were relief and intaglio. In the former, the design
          is put into relief by cutting what is not part of the design below the surface,
          and in the latter, designs are incised into metal plates. Woodcut, an example
          of the former, was the first printing technique, in use by the late 14th
          century. Engraving, invented in the 15th century, was the first of the intaglio
          techniques. It requires gravers or burins (figs. 1, 2, C) with
          wedge-shaped tips for gouging lines into the surface of metal plates, scrapers
          (figs. 4, 5) to remove the metal forced up by the burin (the
          burr), and burnishers (figs. 6, 7) to polish lines smooth. A
          whetstone (fig. D) is used to sharpen the burins.
