          The two kinds of reproductive prints in the 18
            <sup>th</sup>
            century were relief and intaglio. In the former, the design
          is put into relief by cutting what is not part of the design below the surface,
          and in the latter, designs are incised into metal plates. Woodcut, an example
          of the former, was the first printing technique, in use by the late 14th
          century. Engraving, invented in the 15th century, was the first of the intaglio
          techniques. It requires gravers or burins (figs. 1, 2, C) with
          wedge-shaped tips for gouging lines into the surface of metal plates, scrapers
          (figs. 4, 5) to remove the metal forced up by the burin (the
          burr), and burnishers (figs. 6, 7) to polish lines smooth. A
          whetstone (fig. D) is used to sharpen the burins.

          Engravers also used a leather pad (fig. 9) upon which
          the plate is engraved and turned, a hammer and anvil (figs. 12, 13) to plane
          and repair plates, a tightly rolled piece of felt and oil (figs. 16, 19) for
          polishing the plates surface, a compass (fig. 17) for measurements, and
          calipers (fig. 18) to mark the point on the plates verso that needed to
          be hammered up when lines on the surface had been scraped down to erase a
          mistake.

        <title>Holding the burin</title>

      <caption>

          Burins are held in the palm of the hand (fig. 4) and
          pushed into the plate and away from the body (fig. 5). To make a curved line,
          the plate is turned on its leather pad while the burin ploughs straight. Unlike
          drawing, writing, painting, and etching, engraving is nonautographic and a
          skill requiring years of training. This is why most painters interested in
          making prints learned etching, a technique in which one uses a needle like a
          pen and thus drawing skills already acquired, rather than engraving.

      <caption>

          Lines cut deeper into the plate will be wider, hold
          more ink, and print darker than those cut slightly (figs. 12, 13). By varying
          the depths and widths of lines, the engraver creates lines that taper and swell
          (fig. 10), and by combining and hatching them in various ways (figs. 6, 7),
          creates the illusion of tone and mass.

        <title>Engraving and Etching</title>

      <caption>

          The first engravers practiced pure
          engraving: an outline of the design was transferred from paper onto a thin wax
          ground covering the plates surface and the lines were cut directly into
          the metal with burins. By the 18
            <sup>th</sup>
            century, this practice had been replaced by
          mixed method engraving, a combination of etching and engraving,
          in which the design was first scratched through the ground with a needle and
          bitten into the plate with acid and then finished with burins (see series of
          illustrations demonstrating etching).

        <title>“Mixed method” engraving of the 18th century</title>

      <caption>

          Mixed-method engraving had become the economic and
          aesthetic norms, because it greatly shortened the amount of time required to
          produce a print and because the resulting line systems were believed (though
          not by Blake) to be more supple, versatile, and grand than either engraving or
          etching alone and hence superior to the works of the ancient
          engravers. As an apprentice to James Basire, a master engraver, Blake learned
          the arts of etching and engraving and excelled in the commercial styles then
          popular, and though he felt spiritually aligned with the ancient engravers, he
          did not emulate their practice until late in the last decade of his
          life.

          The complex hatching system seen here was known as

            <sup>th</sup>
            -century engraving, for small book illustrations as well as
          the larger, separately sold, reproductions of paintings, and lives today in
          bank-note engraving. Whereas renaissance engravers had drawing as their
          paradigm, which guided how they made and combined lines and used the white of
          the paper, the modern engravers had engraving, now centuries old,
          as their paradigm, which had evolved into a highly artificial, albeit virtuoso,
          performance in metal in which every part of the design, even the highlights,
          were enmeshed in a unifying line system. Detail of

        <title>Engravers as copyists</title>

      <caption>

          Despite their remarkable graphic language and skill,
          engravers were considered more copyist and craftsman than artist because they
          were not the inventors of the designs. The muse inspires the artist, pointing
          to his head as the true origin of the design, which moves from concept to work
          on paper or canvas and through the reproductive process, through etching (boy
          agitating the acid) to engraving, a move symbolizing the distance between
          original and copy. The dismissal of craft or execution as less significant than
          invention deeply bothered Blake; philosophically, in a platonic aesthetic, this
          hierarchy and separation extended to the artist as well, since the material
          artifact could not realize perfectly the idea as originally conceived in the
          mind. While Blake stated that he copied imagination as others copied nature, he
          countered this received hierarchy and separation by arguing that invention can
          only be known as it is executed and that execution generates invention.

        <title>Printing intaglio plates on the rolling press</title>

      <caption>

          Engravings, like all intaglio plates, are printed on
          rolling presses. A printer operates a rolling press, another inks a plate on a
          brassier, and another wipes a plates surfaces of ink in preparation for
          the press. The intaglio plate is placed face up on the long plank
          (bed) of the press, dampened paper is placed on top of it, and
          three or four felt blankets cover them as the bed passes through heavy top and
          bottom rollers. The top roller exerts great pressure to force the paper into
          the incised lines of the plate.

          In his 22
            *Illustrations of the Book of Job*
            engravings, published in 1826, Blake reproduced his own designs
          and, hence, as artist and engraver produced what was understood as
          original rather than reproductive prints. He
          returned to the earliest style of engraving, to the pure engraving practiced by
          his heroes, Albrecht Durer and Marcantonio Raimondi. The lines, engraved
          directly into the plate without preliminary etching, are densely laid in a
          parallel rather than cross-hatched style, as evinced by the detail of plate
          12. Essick Collection.

          The first intaglio tonal method was mezzotint,

          paint. Mezzotinters work from black to white, rather than on a white ground
          with black line. The plate is roughened with a rocker, a tool
          with serrated edges (fig. 1) that incised the entire plate with thousands of
          overlapping lines to create, when printed, a solid black ground. Working with
          scrapers and burnishers, the mezzotinter reduces the ground and thus the amount
          of ink printed to create grays and whites (fig. 9).

          The watercolor paint can be diluted with water to produce stains or translucency, or used undiluted or with whiting to produce a paint film and more opaque tones.

            *Songs of Innocence*copy E, 1789, as it left Blake’s printshop: the impressions were stabbed through three holes between sheets of wove paper (“wrappers”). In the 18
            <sup>th</sup>
            century, books were sold in uncut sheets, with binding the responsibility of the buyer. Blake knew that purchasers would have the books rebound to fit the style of the other books in their libraries. Berg Collection, New York Public Library.
