            The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of the electronic edition of <hi rend="i">Milton a Poem</hi> Copy B. There are only four copies of <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>, Blake's most personal epic. Copy B, from the Huntington Library and Art Gallery, joins Copy A, from the British Museum, and Copy C, from the New York Public Library, previously published in the Archive.<lb/><lb/>
            Blake etched forty-five plates for <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> in relief, with some full-page designs in white-line etching, between c. 1804 (the date on the title page) and c. 1810. Six additional plates (a-f) were probably etched in subsequent years up to 1818. No copy contains all fifty-one plates. The prose "Preface" (Plate 2) appears only in Copies A and B. Plates a-e appear only in Copies C and D, plate f only in Copy D. The first printing, late in 1810 or early in 1811, produced Copies A-C, printed in black ink and finished in water colors. Blake retained Copy C and added new plates and rearranged others at least twice; Copy C was not finished until c. 1821. Copy D was printed in 1818 in orange ink and elaborately colored. The Archive will publish an electronic edition of Copy D in the near future.<lb/><lb/>
            Like all the illuminated books in the Archive, the text and images of <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> Copy B are fully searchable and are supported by our Inote and ImageSizer applications. With the Archive's Compare feature, users can easily juxtapose multiple impressions of any plate across the different copies of this or any of the other illuminated books. New protocols for transcription, which produce improved accuracy and fuller documentation in editors' notes, have been applied to all copies of <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> in the Archive.<lb/><lb/>
            With the publication of <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> Copy B, the Archive now contains fully searchable and scalable electronic editions of sixty-eight copies of Blake's nineteen illuminated books in the context of full bibliographic information about each work, careful diplomatic transcriptions of all texts, detailed descriptions of all images, and extensive bibliographies. In addition to illuminated books, the Archive contains many important manuscripts and series of engravings, sketches, and water color drawings, including Blake's illustrations to Thomas Gray's <hi rend="i">Poems</hi>, water color and engraved illustrations to Dante's <hi rend="i">Divine Comedy</hi>, the large color printed drawings of 1795 and c. 1805, the Linnell and Butts sets of the <hi rend="i">Book of Job</hi> water colors and the sketchbook containing drawings for the engraved illustrations to the <hi rend="i">Book of Job</hi>, the water color illustrations to Robert Blair's <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, and all nine of Blake's water color series illustrating the poetry of John Milton.<lb/><lb/>
            As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the continuing support of the Library of Congress, and the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.

Smith acting for Henry E. Huntington).  The earlier history of this copy is uncertain.  It may be the copy which Thomas Griffiths Wainewright claimed on 28 March 1826 that he had "lately purchased," and also the copy offered from the collection of James Weale by the book dealer Robert Harding Evans apparently at auction, 7 Feb. 1840, lot 610 (no price or purchaser recorded).  If so, then this may be the copy offered from the collection of Philip Hurd by Evans, 30 July 1845, lot 162 (&#163;6.17s.6d. to the dealer Henry Bohn).  Alternatively, the Huntington Copy B may be an entirely different volume, the one sold from the collection of Thomas Butts, Sotheby's, 26 March 1852, lot 53 (£9 to the book dealer James Toovey). </note></provenance><repository><institution>Huntington Library, Art Collections, adn Botanical Gardens</institution><addressline>1151 Oxford Road</addressline><addressline>San Marino, California 91108</addressline><addressline>USA</addressline><addressline>Telephone: 626-405-2191</addressline><addressline>Fax: 626-405-0225</addressline><addressline>URL (general): http://www.huntington.org</addressline><addressline>URL (Library Division): http://www.huntington.org/LibraryDiv/LibraryHome.html</addressline><department>Library, Rare Books</department><repositoryid label="Call number">54041</repositoryid></repository></source><desc id="milton.b.illbk.01" dbi="milton.b.P1"><objtitle><title type="transcribed">MILTON a Poem in 2 Books</title>,

at least nine human figures.  The two largest appear in the lower right and left sections of the image.  
Both are nude; the figure on the left is probably male.  We see him from behind, but his face appears 
to be turned to the left.  His arms are raised vertically and his right leg is extended to the right, 
nearly touching the right foot of his companion (probably female).  His left leg is drawn up toward 
his torso.  Vague indications of vegetative forms appear—or perhaps even grow from—his head.  The 
grain tassels below him suggest that he is a personification of grain.  His female companion on the 
right has her right leg extended (only a sliver of her left leg is pictured) so that her right foot 
nearly touches the male's right foot.  Her body is twisted and bent sharply at the waist; she faces 
to the left.  Her arms are raised over her head; between them are some confused forms that may be a  
bunch of grapes.  Thus, while her male companion may personify grain, she may personify grapes or wine.  
Other vegetative forms appear below her.  A plant grows from the point, lower center, between the feet 
of these two major figures.  In this copy, green coloring suggests grass beneath the two large figures.
The top right corner of the composition is dominated by a large star or comet; 
its lines of radiance or beams of light extend all the way to the left margin.  Seven small
figures decorate the letters of the heading.  A figure rests, at a 45 degree angle, against the first
vertical of "M"; another figure, perhaps gowned, sits in a contracted posture against the final
vertical of the letter.  He or she faces to the right.  A figure stands rigidly, facing forward, on 
the lower loop of "L" in "MILTON."  The top horizontal of the "T" bears a seated and probably gowned
figure, facing to the right and with legs bent but extended in the same direction.  In the "O" of 
"MILTON," a small figure, perhaps a child, strides to the right with arms raised vertically.  This
figure holds a string in his or her left hand, attached at its upper end to a bird in flight.  A 
larger figure, probably an adult, leans against the right side of the "O" and looks to the left,
toward the child.  A very small figure, probably facing left, leans against the vertical of the "F" 
in the word "First."  Two birds fly on extended wings above the "B" of "Book"; a large bird flies to the

On
the right is a figure standing on a (stone?) plinth.  His legs are spread apart and 
both arms raised at approximately 45 degrees.  Both hands are clenched into fists.  
His muscular body is twisted, with his head bent sharply to the left.  His mouth is 
open slightly and his face expresses anger, perhaps mixed with fear.  He faces
forward, but his head is bent to the left and his eyes seem to be turned up and 
to the left.  He is surrounded by flames, the shape of which is imitated by his hair.
On the left, the front-most figure, seen from behind, is standing with legs together.  
His face is seen in profile turned to the right; he appears to be looking at the man 
in flames.  His hair is curly.  His one visible arm (the right) is bent at the elbow 
and he holds his hands together, perhaps in prayer.  His face suggests a combination 
of meekness, pity, and surprise.  His body is very muscular.  To the left of this figure 
we see the head, legs, and upper right body of another standing nude male, facing forward. 
He has long hair, with his head twisted to the right (he is probably looking at the
man in flames).  His face also suggests surprise or pity.  His legs are spread apart.  
His left foot is raised on to the plinth and touches the right foot of the man in
flames.  His left arm is bent before his body, with the fingers of that hand spread 
apart (his right hand is not clearly pictured).  These three figures have been variously
identified; our best guess is that Rintrah (a representative of wrath) is the figure 
on the plinth, Satan stands in the left foreground (associated with false pity and 
with Blake's patron, William Hayley, in the poem's autobiographical allegory), and
Palamabron (a milder counterpart of Rintrah) stands in the left background.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="BD"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>young</characteristic><characteristic>muscular</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>feet</characteristic><characteristic>feet touching</characteristic><characteristic>legs spread</characteristic><characteristic>twisted</characteristic><characteristic>fist</characteristic><characteristic>arms raised at 45 degrees</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>eyes raised</characteristic><characteristic>anger</characteristic><characteristic>fear</characteristic><characteristic>flame-like hair</characteristic><characteristic>fire</characteristic><characteristic>plinth</characteristic><characteristic>Rintrah</characteristic><illusobjdesc>On the right side of this full-plate design

the portrayal of the Cain and Abel story on Plate 12.  The
characters and thematic implications, however, are very different. 
On the left, a nude male arches or falls backward with his head
bent back and his arms extended horizontally.  His legs are spread
apart, with the right leg bent at the knee.  His hands are raised
horizontally, palms up.  This posture suggests crucifixion or a
moment of ecstasy, religious and/or erotic.  A comet or falling
star trailing lines of radiance descends into the man's left foot. 
The very close similarities between this figure and the man on
Plate 29 indicate that this too is William Blake with Milton (the
comet) descending into his tarsus (see the text on this plate
lines 48-51).  The gowned female standing on the right may be Blake's
wife, Catherine, turning away from the dramatic events on the left
(which she may mistake for death rather than revelation).  Her
lower body apparently faces forward, but her upper body and head
are twisted to the right.  Her head is bent down into her hands. 
Her arms are bent at the elbows.  Between the two figures is an
altar of stones with vines or roots growing over it, much like the
altar on Plate 12.  Blue wash in the background of this scene indicates 
sky; green wash below the figure on the left suggests grass.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="C"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>falling backward</characteristic><characteristic>facing up</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>head bent back</characteristic><characteristic>Blake, William</characteristic><characteristic>feet</characteristic><characteristic>left foot</characteristic><characteristic>tarsus</characteristic><characteristic>ecstasy</characteristic><characteristic>erotic</characteristic><characteristic>crucified</characteristic><characteristic>arms raised horizontally</characteristic><characteristic>hands raised, palms up</characteristic><characteristic>legs spread</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent at knee</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent forward</characteristic><characteristic>leg extended backward</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A nude male arches or falls backward with his head

youthful and muscular nude male, seen from behind.  He has short
hair and is striding away from us, bent left leg forward and right
leg extended behind.  His right foot and its tarsus are prominent
as it breaks the word "Self- -hood" in the brief text below.  His
arms are raised vertically and reach forward (in
relation to his body) to grasp the head of an old, gowned figure
behind him and facing us.  The young man is Milton in the act of
both wrestling with and sculpting the ancient form of Urizen, as
described on Plate 17 in this copy.  Urizen's face,
twisted to the right, expresses grief; his eyes may be looking
upward.  He has a long beard and long hair.  His legs are spread
apart, with the right leg plunged into the River Arnon that runs
horizontally between the two figures.  His left leg is bent at the
knee, with the lower leg extended to the right.  Urizen's arms are
raised horizontally, with each hand, palms down, resting on the top
of a rectangular stone pillar.  These may be tombstones or the
tablets of the decalogue; each bears Hebrew letters on its forward
side.  They are tilted, as though about to fall to each side. 
Behind Urizen is a hill on which a group of five figures stands. 
All play musical instruments: from left to right, a horn or
trumpet, a tambourine, a harp, a horn with one loop in it, and
another tambourine.  The two gowned females on the left in this
group may be walking to the left.  Both have their arms raised. 
The woman nearest the left margin has her head back with her horn
to her mouth; the next woman to the right has long hair; her head
is twisted so that she faces forward.  The central figure is a
curly-haired male, facing forward in a contrapposto stance.  He is
probably wearing tights.  The next figure to the right is another
gowned female, perhaps walking to the left.  To her right and
slightly behind her is yet another gowned woman with her arms and
tambourine raised above her head.  These figures have been
interpreted as personifications of the liberated senses, but they
might be the "sons &amp; daughters" of Rahab and Tirzah who "In all
their beauty...entice Milton across the river" (Plate 17, lines 31-32).  
Beams of radiant light (a sunrise or sunset?) emanate from behind the dark
hill on which the musicians stand.  Leafy, indeterminate vegetation lines

described on Plate 20 of the text.  William Blake, a muscular nude, kneels on his
left leg, with the right leg bent sharply at the knee.  (In other copies, both 
Blake and Los also have the outlines of loincloths or very short breeches on their 
bodies.)  The outlines of a sandal appear beneath his right foot; its straps appear 
on his upper foot and ankle.  His hair is slightly curly.  His left arm is at his
side, extending to his left thigh; his right arm is bent upward.  We see the back
of his right hand, fingers spread.  His body faces forward, but his head is
twisted violently up and to the right.  He appears to be looking up at the standing 
figure behind him.  This is Los, also a muscular nude.  He faces forward with legs
spread, striding toward us with his right foot within the disc of the sun behind 
him and his left foot on the grass-covered hill or mound on which Blake kneels.  
However, if the perspective is cosmic, this "hill" is the circumference of the 
earth.  The passage illustrated makes it clear that the setting is the Vale of
Lambeth.  Los's hair is curly and his arms are bent upward, with his right hand 
raised, palm out, and the fingers spread.  The fingers of his raised left hand 
are behind his head, twisted down and to the right.  He is probably looking down
toward Blake.  The relative positions of the two figures have suggested
oral-genital contact to some interpreters.  Flames appear within the disc of the  
sun on both sides of Los; flames emanate from the sun's circumference.  Background 
coloring suggests flames and smoke.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="CD"><characteristic>Blake, William</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>muscular</characteristic><characteristic>kneeling</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent at knee</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised</characteristic><characteristic>arm at side</characteristic><characteristic>arm resting</characteristic><characteristic>fingers spread</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing up</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>sandal</characteristic><characteristic>twisted</characteristic><characteristic>erotic</characteristic><illusobjdesc>William Blake, a muscular nude, kneels on his left leg,

We see the back of his right hand, fingers spread.  His body faces forward, but his head 
is twisted violently up and to the right.  He appears to be looking up at the standing 
figure behind him.  The relative positions of the two figures have suggested oral-genital
contact to some interpreters.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>Los</characteristic><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>muscular</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>striding</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing down</characteristic><characteristic>eyes down</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>arms bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>hand raised, palm out</characteristic><characteristic>fingers spread</characteristic><characteristic>erotic</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Los is pictured standing, a muscular nude male.

of his raised left hand are behind his head, twisted down and to the right.  
He is probably looking down toward Blake.  The relative positions of the two

a nude and muscular male seen from behind.  He hovers with legs spread

in ecstasy.  His left leg is bent sharply at the knee with the right leg forward.  
Thus, his legs are spread apart, perhaps because he is striding to the left (the 
direction in which his body faces).  His arms are raised horizontally, with hands
raised, palms out.  This posture suggests crucifixion.  The fingers of both hands are 
spread apart slightly.  He wears short, semi-transparent tights extending from his waist 
to his upper thighs.  Three (stone?) steps are pictured lower 
right.  The dark background suggests that this may be a night scene.  Blake would appear 
to be standing on a small strip of grass-covered ground.  See Plate 29 for the brotherly 
companion to this image.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>muscular</characteristic><characteristic>Blake, Robert</characteristic><characteristic>Milton</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>striding</characteristic><characteristic>crucified</characteristic><characteristic>bending backward</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent at knee</characteristic><characteristic>legs spread</characteristic><characteristic>head bent back</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>ecstasy</characteristic><characteristic>arms raised horizontally</characteristic><characteristic>fingers spread</characteristic><characteristic>muscular</characteristic><characteristic>partly nude</characteristic><characteristic>tights</characteristic><characteristic>feet</characteristic><characteristic>right foot</characteristic><illusobjdesc>As the inscription indicates, the standing, muscular

below the brief text is very probably Ololon.  Her legs are together and her arms 
raised at 135 degrees.  She holds in her raised hands, palms up, a cloak or veil.  
This gesture suggests that she is disrobing to reveal her body, which faces forward.  
Her hair is long and flame-like and her head is raised slightly. Her posture hints 
at a crucifixion; the outline of her form, including the veil, suggests the shape of
a chalice.  On each side of this central female are grain stems and/or tassels given 
human (male) forms.  These two have their legs together and look toward Ololon.  Both
have curly hair.  The individual ears of grain form cloaks around these two figures. 
Spiky lines between the anthropomorphic grain and Ololon suggest more grain stems.  
The light blue wash in the background suggests sky.  The green ground on which all 
three figures stand suggests grass.  The odd forms upper right and left suggest trees.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>Ololon</characteristic><characteristic>cloak</characteristic><characteristic>veil</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>legs together</characteristic><characteristic>arms raised at 135 degrees</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>eyes raised</characteristic><characteristic>hands raised, palms up</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>flame-like hair</characteristic><characteristic>crucified</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>chalice</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The standing nude female in the center of the design
below the brief text is very probably Ololon.  Her legs are together and her arms 
raised at 135 degrees.  She holds in her raised hands, palms up, a cloak or veil.  
This gesture suggests that she is disrobing to reveal her body, which faces forward.  
Her hair is long and flame-like and her head is raised slightly.  Her eyes have no pupils. 
Her posture hints at a crucifixion; the outline of her form, including the veil, suggests 
the shape of a chalice.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="AC"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>young</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>legs together</characteristic><characteristic>grain stem</characteristic><characteristic>grain tassel</characteristic><characteristic>seen from behind</characteristic><characteristic>facing away</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>cloak</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The anthropomorphic form of a grain stem and/or tassel
