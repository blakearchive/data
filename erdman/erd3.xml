faculty of knowing must be the faculty which experiences.  This faculty I
treat of.</p><p>PRINCIPLE 1st  That the Poetic Genius is the true Man. and that the body
or outward form of Man is derived from the Poetic Genius.  Likewise that the
forms of all things are derived from their Genius. which by the Ancients was
call'd an Angel &amp; Spirit &amp; Demon.</p><p>PRINCIPLE 2d  As all men are alike in outward form, So (and with the
same infinite variety) all are alike in the Poetic Genius</p><p>PRINCIPLE 3d  No man can think write or speak from his heart, but he
must intend truth. Thus all sects of Philosophy are from the Poetic Genius
adapted to the weaknesses of every individual</p><p>PRINCIPLE 4. As none by traveling over known lands can find out the unknown.
 So from already acquired knowledge Man could not acquire more. therefore
an universal Poetic Genius exists</p><p>PRINCIPLE. 5. The Religions of all Nations are derived from each Nations
different reception of the Poetic Genius which is every where call'd the Spirit
of Prophecy.</p><p>PRINCIPLE 6 The Jewish &amp; Christian Testaments are An original derivation
from the Poetic Genius. this is necessary from the confined nature of bodily

as a nether sky appeard beneath us &amp; we held by the roots of trees and
hung over this immensity; but I said, if you please we will commit ourselves
to this void, and see whether providence is here also, if you will not I will?

crawling after their prey; which flew or rather swum in the infinite deep,
in the most terrific shapes of animals sprung from corruption. &amp; the air

he said, between the black &amp; white spiders</p><p>  But now, from between the black &amp; white spiders a cloud and fire
burst and rolled thro the deep blackning all beneath, so that the nether deep
grew black as a sea &amp; rolled with a terrible noise: beneath us was nothing
now to be seen but a black tempest, till looking east between the clouds &amp;
the waves, we saw a cataract of blood mixed with fire and not many stones
throw from us appeard and sunk again the scaly fold of a monstrous serpent.
at last to the east, distant about three degrees appeard a fiery crest above
the waves slowly it reared like a ridge of golden rocks till we discoverd
two globes of crimson fire. from which The sea fled away in clouds of smoke,
and now we saw, it was the head of Leviathan. his forehead was divided into
streaks of green &amp; purple like those on a tygers forehead: soon we saw
his mouth &amp; red gills hang just above the raging foam tinging the black
deep with beams of blood, advancing toward <milestone rend="inline" n="19" unit="PLATE"/> us with all the fury of a spiritual existence.</p><p>  My friend the Angel climb'd up from his station into the mill; I remain'd
alone, &amp; then this appearance was no more, but I found<pb n="42"/> myself
sitting on a pleasant bank beside a river by moon light hearing a harper who
sung to the harp. &amp; his theme was, The man who never alters his opinion

ran away, I found myself on a bank by moonlight hearing a harper, But now
we have seen my eternal lot, shall I shew you yours? he laughd at my proposal:
but I by force suddenly caught him in my arms, &amp; flew westerly thro' the
night, till we were elevated above the earths shadow: then I flung myself
with him directly into the body of the sun, here I clothed myself in white,
&amp; taking in my hand Swedenborgs volumes sunk from the glorious clime,
and passed all the planets till we came to saturn, here I staid to rest &amp;

we saw the stable and the church, &amp; I took him to the altar and open'd
the Bible, and lo! it was a deep pit, into which I descended driving the Angel
before me, soon we saw seven houses of brick, one we enterd; in it were a <milestone rend="inline" n="20" unit="PLATE"/> number of monkeys, baboons, &amp; all of
that species chaind by the middle, grinning and snatching at one another,

wiser than the monkey, grew vain, and conciev'd himself as much<pb n="43"/>wiser

&amp; conversed not with Devils who all hate religion, for he was incapable
thro' his conceited notions.</p><p>Thus Swedenborgs writings are a recapitulation of all superficial opinions,
and an analysis of the more sublime, but no further.</p><p>Have now another plain fact: Any man of mechanical talents may from the
writings of Paracelsus or Jacob Behmen, produce ten thousand volumes of equal
value with Swedenborg's. and from those of Dante or Shakespear, an infinite

and has not Jesus Christ given his sanction to the law of ten commandments
and are not all other men fools, sinners, &amp; nothings?</p><p>  The Devil answer'd; bray a fool in a morter with wheat. yet shall not
his folly be beaten out of him: if Jesus Christ is the greatest man, you ought
to love him in the greatest degree; now hear how he has given his sanction
to the law of ten commandments: did he not mock at the sabbath, and so mock
the sabbaths God? murder those who were murderd because of him? turn away
the law from the woman taken in adultery? steal the labor of others to support
him? bear false witness when he omitted making a defence before Pilate? covet
when he pray'd for his disciples, and when he bid them shake off the dust
of their feet against such as refused to lodge them? I tell you, no virtue
can exist without breaking these ten commandments: Jesus was all virtue, and
acted from im<milestone rend="inline" n="24" unit="PLATE"/>pulse: not from

Cadence like that used by Milton &amp; Shakspeare &amp; all writers of English
Blank Verse, derived from the modern bondage of Rhyming; to be a necessary
and indispensible part of Verse. But I soon found that<pb n="146"/> in the
mouth of a true Orator such monotony was not only awkward, but as much a bondage
as rhyme itself.  I therefore have produced a variety in every line, both
of cadences &amp; number of syllables. Every word and every letter is studied
and put into its fit place: the terrific numbers are reserved for the terrific
parts—the mild &amp; gentle, for the mild &amp; gentle parts, and the
prosaic, for inferior parts: all are necessary to each other. Poetry Fetter'd,
Fetters the Human Race! Nations are Destroy'd, or Flourish, in proportion

 Man is born a Spectre or Satan &amp; is altogether an Evil, &amp; requires
a New Selfhood continually &amp; must continually be changed into his direct
Contrary.  But your Greek Philosophy (which is a remnant of Druidism) teaches
that Man is Righteous in his Vegetated Spectre: an Opinion of fatal &amp;
accursed consequence to Man, as the Ancients saw plainly by Revelation to
the intire abrogation of<pb n="201"/> Experimental Theory. and many believed
what they saw, and Prophecied of Jesus.</p><p>Man must &amp; will have Some Religion; if he has not the Religion of
Jesus, he will have the Religion of Satan, &amp; will erect the Synagogue
of Satan. calling the Prince of this World, God; and destroying all who do
not worship Satan under the Name of God. Will any one say: Where are those
who worship Satan under the Name of God! Where are they? Listen! Every Religion
that Preaches Vengeance for Sins the Religion of the Enemy &amp; Avenger;
and not the Forgiver of Sin, and their God is Satan, Named by the Divine Name
  Your Religion O Deists: Deism, is the Worship of the God of this World by
the means of what you call Natural Religion and Natural Philosophy, and of
Natural Morality or Self-Righteousness, the Selfish Virtues of the Natural
Heart. This was the Religion of the Pharisees who murderd Jesus.  Deism is
the same &amp; ends in the same.</p><p>Voltaire Rousseau Gibbon Hume. charge the Spiritually Religious with
Hypocrisy! but how a Monk or a Methodist either, can be a Hypocrite: I cannot
concieve.  We are Men of like passions with others &amp; pretend not to be
holier than others: therefore, when a Religious Man falls into Sin, he ought
not to be calld a Hypocrite: this title is more properly to be given to a
Player who falls into Sin; whose profession is Virtue &amp; Morality &amp;
the making Men Self-Righteous.  Foote in calling Whitefield, Hypocrite: was
himself one: for Whitefield pretended not to be holier than others: but confessed
his Sins before all the World; Voltaire! Rousseau! You cannot escape my charge
that you are Pharisees &amp; Hypocrites, for you are constantly talking of
the Virtues of the Human Heart, and particularly of your own, that you may
accuse others &amp; especially the Religious, whose errors, you by this display
of pretended Virtue, chiefly design to expose.  Rousseau thought Men Good
by Nature; he found them Evil &amp; found no friend.  Friendship cannot exist
without Forgiveness of Sins continually.  The Book written by Rousseau calld
his Confessions is an apology &amp; cloke for his sin &amp; not a confession.</p><p>But you also charge the poor Monks &amp; Religious with being the causes
of War: while you acquit &amp; flatter the Alexanders &amp; Caesars, the Lewis's
&amp; Fredericks: who alone are its causes &amp; its actors.  But the Religion
of Jesus, Forgiveness of Sin, can never be the cause of a War nor of a single
Martyrdom.</p><p>Those who Martyr others or who cause War are Deists, but never can be
Forgivers of Sin.  The Glory of Christianity is, To  Conquer by Forgiveness.
 All the Destruction therefore,  Christian Europe has arisen from Deism, which
is Natural Religion.</p><lg type="stanza"><l n="1" rend="1">  I saw a Monk of Charlemaine<ptr target="tn201.1"/></l><l n="2">Arise before my sight</l><l n="3" rend="1">  I talkd with the Grey Monk as we stood <ptr target="tn201.2"/></l><l n="4">In beams of infernal light</l></lg><pb n="202"/><lg type="stanza"><l n="5" rend="1">  Gibbon arose with a lash of steel<ptr target="tn202.1"/></l><l n="6">And Voltaire with a wracking wheel</l><l n="7" rend="1">  The Schools in clouds of learning rolld<ptr target="tn202.1"/></l><l n="8">Arose with War in iron &amp; gold.</l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l n="9" rend="1">  Thou lazy Monk they sound afar<ptr target="tn202.3"/></l><l n="10">In vain condemning glorious War <ptr target="tn202.4"/></l><l n="11" rend="1">  And in your Cell you shall ever dwell<ptr target="tn202.5"/></l><l n="12">Rise War &amp; bind him in his Cell.</l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l n="13" rend="1">  The blood. red ran from the Grey Monks side</l><l n="14">His hands &amp; feet were wounded wide</l><l n="15" rend="1">  His body bent, his arms &amp; knees</l><l n="16">Like to the roots of ancient trees</l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l n="17" rend="1">  When Satan first the black bow bent<ptr target="tn202.6"/></l><l n="18">And the Moral Law from the Gospel rent</l><l n="19" rend="1">  He forgd the Law into a Sword</l><l n="20">And spilld the blood of mercys Lord.</l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l n="21" rend="1">  Titus!

Spirit? is the Holy Ghost any other than an Intellectual Fountain? What is
the Harvest of the Gospel &amp; its Labours? What is that Talent which it
is a curse to hide? What are the Treasures of Heaven which we are to lay up
for ourselves, are they any other than Mental Studies &amp; Performances?

so, I cannot tell: he has told the story of Bellerophon &amp; omitted the
judgmet of Paris which is not only a part, but a principal part of Homers
subject</p><p>But when a Work has Unity it is as much in a Part as in the Whole. the
Torso is as much a Unity as the Laocoon</p><p>As Unity is the cloke of folly so Goodness is the cloke of knavery  Those
who will have Unity exclusively in Homer come out with a Moral like a sting
in the tail: Aristotle says Characters are either Good or Bad: now Goodness
or Badness has nothing to do with Character. an Apple tree a Pear tree a Horse
a Lion, are Characters but a Good Apple tree or a Bad, is an Apple tree still:
a Horse is not more a Lion for being a Bad Horse. that is its Character; its
Goodness or Badness is another consideration.</p><p>  It is the same with the Moral of a whole Poem as with the Moral Goodness <pb n="270"/> of its parts Unity &amp; Morality, are secondary considerations &amp;
belong to Philosophy &amp; not to Poetry, to Exception &amp; not to Rule,
to Accident &amp; not to Substance. the Ancients calld it eating of the tree
of good &amp; evil.</p><p>The Classics, it is the Classics! &amp; not Goths nor Monks, that Desolate

     with a knife smote him.</l><l n="38">In the tower nam'd Order, an old man, whose white beard cover'd
     the stone floor like weeds</l><l n="39">On margin of the sea, shrivel'd up by heat of day and cold of  
   night; his den was short</l><l n="40">And narrow as a grave dug for a child, with spiders webs wove,

reposed in the valley; the birds of day were heard in their nests, rustling
in brakes and thickets; and the owl and bat flew round the darkening trees:
all is silent when Nature takes her repose.—In former times, on such <supplied>[a]</supplied>n evening, when the cold clay breathed with life, and our ancestors,
who now sleep in their graves, walked on the stedfast globe, the remains of
a family of the tribes of Earth, a mother and a sister were gathered to the
sick bed of a youth: Sorrow linked them together, leaning on one another's
necks alternately—like lilies, dropping tears in each other's bosom,
they stood by the bed like reeds bending over a lake, when the evening drops
trickle down.  His voice was low as the whisperings of the woods when the
wind is asleep, and the visions of Heaven unfold their visitation.  “Parting
is hard, and death is terrible; I seem to walk through a deep valley, far
from the light of day, alone and comfortless! The damps of death fall thick
upon me! Horrors stare me in the face! I look behind, there is no returning;
Death follows after me; I walk in regions of Death, where no tree is; without
a lantern to direct my steps, without a staff to support me.”—Thus
he laments through the still evening, till the curtains of darkness were drawn!
Like the sound of a broken pipe, the aged woman raised her voice.  “O
my son, my son, I know but little of the path thou goest! But lo, there is
a God, who made the world; stretch out thy hand to Him.” The youth replied,
like a voice heard from a sepulchre, “My hand is feeble, how should
I stretch it out? My ways are sinful, how should I raise mine eyes? My voice
hath used deceit, how should I call on Him who is Truth? My breath is loathsome,
how should he not be offended? If I lay my face in the dust, the grave opens
its mouth for me; if I lift up my head, sin covers me as a cloak! O my dear
friends, pray ye for me! Stretch forth your hands, that my helper may come!
Through the void space I walk between the sinful world and eternity! Beneath
me burns eternal fire! O for a hand to pluck me forth!” As the voice
of an omen heard in the silent valley, when the few inhabitants cling trembling
together; as the voice of the Angel of Death, when the thin beams of the moon
give a faint light, such was this young man's voice to his friends! Like the
bubbling waters of the brook in the dead of night, the aged woman raised her
cry, and said, “O Voice, that dwellest in my breast, can I not cry,
and lift my eyes to heaven? Thinking of this, my spirit is turned within me
into confusion! O my child, my child! is thy breath infected? So is mine.
 As the deer, wounded by the brooks of water, so the arrows of sin stick in
my flesh; the poison hath entered into my marrow.”—Like rolling
waves, upon a desert shore, sighs succeeded sighs; they covered their faces,
and wept! The youth lay silent—his mother's arm was<pb n="442"/> under
his head; he was like a cloud tossed by the winds, till the sun shine, and
the drops of rain glisten, the yellow harvest breathes, and the thankful eyes
of the villagers are turned up in smiles.  The traveller that hath taken shelter
under an oak, eyes the distant country with joy!  Such smiles were seen upon
the face of the youth! a visionary hand wiped away his tears, and a ray of
light beamed around his head!  All was still.  The moon hung not out her lamp,
and the stars faintly glimmered in the summer sky; the breath of night slept
among the leaves of the forest; the bosom of the lofty hill drank in the silent
dew, while on his majestic brow the voice of Angels is heard, and stringed
sounds ride upon the wings of night.  The sorrowful pair lift up their heads,
hovering Angels are around them, voices of comfort are heard over the Couch
of Death, and the youth breathes out his soul with joy into eternity.</p></div3><div3 type="sketch" id="b3.2.11"><head rend="center"> CONTEMPLATION.</head><p>Who is this, that with unerring step dares tempt the wilds, where only
Nature's foot hath trod? 'Tis Contemplation, daughter of the grey Morning!
Majestical she steppeth, and with her pure quill on every flower writeth Wisdom's
name.  Now lowly bending, whispers in mine ear, “O man, how great, how
little thou! O man, slave of each moment, lord of eternity! seest thou where
Mirth sits on the painted cheek? doth it not seem ashamed of such a place,
and grow immoderate to brave it out? O what an humble garb true joy puts on!
Those who want Happiness must stoop to find it; it is a flower that grows
in every vale.  Vain foolish man, that roams on lofty rocks! where, 'cause
his garments are swoln with wind, he fancies he is grown into a giant! Lo
then, Humility, take it, and wear it in thine heart; lord of thyself, thou
then art lord of all.  Clamour brawls along the streets, and destruction hovers
in the city's smoak; but on these plains, and in these silent woods, true
joys descend: here build thy nest; here fix thy staff; delights blossom around;
numberless beauties blow; the green grass springs in joy, and the nimble air
kisses the leaves; the brook stretches its arms along the velvet meadow, its
silver inhabitants sport and play; the youthful sun joys like a hunter rouzed
to the chace: he rushes up the sky, and lays hold on the immortal coursers
of day; the sky glitters with the jingling trappings!  Like a triumph, season
follows season, while the airy music fills the world with joyful sounds.”
 I answered, “Heavenly goddess!  I am wrapped in mortality, my flesh
is a prison, my bones the bars of death, Misery builds over our cottage roofs,
and Discontent runs like a brook.  Even in childhood, Sorrow slept with me
in my cradle; he followed me up and down in the house when I grew up; he was
my school-fellow: thus he was in my steps and in my play, till he became to
me as my brother.  I walked through dreary places with him, and in church-yards;
and I oft found myself sitting by Sorrow on a tomb-stone!”</p></div3><div3 type="sketch" id="b3.2.12"><pb n="443"/><head rend="center">SAMSON.<ptr target="tn443.1"/></head><p>Samson, the strongest of the children of men, I sing; how he was foiled
by woman's arts, by a false wife brought to the gates of death!  O Truth,
that shinest with propitious beams, turning our earthly night to heavenly
day, from presence of the Almighty Father! thou visitest our darkling world
with blessed feet, bringing good news of Sin and Death destroyed!  O white-robed
Angel, guide my timorous hand to write as on a lofty rock with iron pens the
words of truth, that all who pass may read.—Now Night, noon-tide of
damned spirits, over the silent earth spreads her pavilion, while in dark
council sat Philista's lords; and where strength failed, black thoughts in
ambush lay.  Their helmed youth and aged warriors in dust together ly, and
Desolation spreads his wings over the land of Palestine; from side to side
the land groans, her prowess lost, and seeks to hide lier bruised head under
the mists of night, breeding dark plots, For Dalila's fair arts have long
been tried in vain; in vain she wept in many a treacherous tear.  “Go
on, fair traitress; do thy guileful work; ere once again the changing moon
her circuit hath performed, thou shalt overcome, and conquer him by force
unconquerable, and wrest his secret from him.  Call thine alluring arts and
honest-seeming brow, the holy kiss of love, and the transparent tear; put
on fair linen, that with the lily vies, purple and silver; neglect thy hair,
to seem more lovely in thy loose attire; put on thy country's pride, deceit;
and eyes of love decked in mild sorrow, and sell thy Lord for gold.”—For
now, upon her sumptuous couch reclined, in gorgeous pride, she still intreats,
and still she grasps his vigorous knees with her fair arms.—“Thou
lov'st me not! thou'rt war, thou art not love! O foolish Dalila! O weak woman!
it is death cloathed in flesh thou lovest, and thou hast been incircled in
his arms!—Alas, my Lord, what am I calling thee?  Thou art my God! 
To thee I pour my tears for sacrifice morning and evening: My days are covered
with sorrow!  Shut up; darkened: By night I am deceived! Who says that thou
wast born Of mortal kind?  Destruction was thy father, a lioness suckled thee,
thy young hands tore human limbs, and gorged human flesh! Come hither, Death;
art thou not Samson's servant?  'Tis Dalila that calls; thy master's wife;
no, stay, and let thy master do the deed: one blow of that strong arm would
ease my pain; then should I lay at quiet, and have rest.  Pity forsook thee
at thy birth!  O Dagon furious, and all ye gods of Palestine, withdraw your
hand! I am but a weak woman.  Alas, I am wedded to your enemy!  I will go
mad, and tear my crisped hair; I'll run about, and pierce the ears o'th' gods!
 O Samson, hold me not; thou lovest me not!  Look not upon me with those deathful
eyes!  Thou wouldst my death, and death approaches fast.”—Thus,
in false tears, she bath'd his feet, and thus she day by day oppressed his
soul: he seemed a mountain, his brow among the clouds; she seemed a silver
stream, his feet embracing.  Dark   thoughts rolled to and fro in his mind,
like thunder<pb n="444"/> clouds, troubling the sky; his visage was troubled;
his soul was distressed.—“Though I should tell her all my heart,
what can I fear?  Though I should tell this secret of my birth, the utmost
may be warded off as well when told as now.” She saw him moved, and
thus resumes her wiles.—“Samson, I'm thine; do with me what thou
wilt; my friends are enemies; my life is death; I am a traitor to my nation,
and despised; my joy is given into the hands of him who hates me, using deceit
to the wife of his bosom. Thrice hast thou mocked me, and grieved my soul.
 Didst thou not tell me with green withs to bind thy nervous arms, and after
   <ptr target="tn444.1"/> that, when I had found thy falshood, with new ropes
to bind thee fast?  I knew thou didst but mock me.  Alas, when in thy sleep
I bound thee with them to try thy truth, I cried, The Philistines be upon
thee, Samson!  Then did suspicion wake thee; how didst thou rend the feeble
ties!  Thou fearest nought, what shouldst thou fear?  Thy power is more than
mortal, none can hurt thee; thy bones are brass, thy sinews are iron!  Ten
thousand spears are like the summer grass; an army of mighty men are as flocks
in the vallies; what canst thou fear?  I drink my tears like water; I live
upon sorrow!  O worse than wolves and tygers, what canst thou give when such
a trifle is denied me?  But O at last thou mockest me to shame my over-fond
inquiry!  Thou toldest me to weave thee to the beam by thy strong hair; I
did even that to try thy truth: but when I cried, The Philistines be upon
thee, then didst thou leave me to bewail that Samson loved me not.”—He
sat, and inward griev'd, he saw and lov'd the beauteous suppliant, nor could
conceal aught that might appease ber; then, leaning on her bosom, thus he
spoke: “Hear, O Dalila! doubt no more of Samson's love; for that fair
breast was made the ivory palace of my inmost heart, where it shall lie at
rest; for sorrow is the lot of all of woman born: for care was I brought forth,
and labour is my lot: not matchless might, nor wisdom, nor every gift enjoyed,
can from the heart of man hide sorrow.—Twice was my birth foretold from
heaven, and twice a sacred vow enjoined me that I should drink no wine, nor
eat of any unclean thing, for holy unto Israel's God I am, a Nazarite even
from my mother's womb.  Twice was it told, that it might not be broken, Grant
me a son, kind Heaven, Manoa cried; but Heaven refused!  Childless he mourned,
but thought his God knew best.  In solitude, though not obscure, in Israel
he lived, till venerable age came on: his flocks increased, and plenty crowned
his board: beloved, revered of man! But God hath other joys in store.  Is
burdened Israel his grief? The son of his old age shall set it free! The venerable
sweetner of his life receives the promise first from Heaven.  She saw the
maidens play, and blessed their innocent mirth; she blessed each new-joined
pair; but from her the long-wished deliverer shall spring.  Pensive, alone
she sat within the house, when busy day was fading, and calm evening, time
for contemplation, rose from the forsaken east, and drew the curtains of heaven;
pensive she sat, and thought on Israel's grief, <pb n="445"/> and Silent prayed
to Israel's God; when lo, an angel from the fields of light entered the house!
 His form was manhood in the prime, and from his spacious brow shot terrors
through the evening shade!  But mild he hailed her—Hail, highly favoured!
said he; for lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son, and Israel's strength
shall be upon his shoulders, and he shall be called Israel's Deliverer! Now
therefore drink no wine, and eat not any unclean thing, for he shall be a
Nazarite to God.—Then, as a neighbour when his evening tale is told,
departs, his blessing leaving; so seemed he to depart: she wondered with exceeding
joy, nor knew he was an angel.  Manoa left his fields to sit in the house,
and take his evening's rest from labour—the sweetest time that God has
allotted mortal man.  He sat, and heard with joy, and praised God who Israel
still doth keep.  The time rolled on, and Israel groaned oppressed.  The sword
was bright, while the plow-share rusted, till hope grew feeble, and was ready
to give place to doubting: then prayed Manoa—O Lord, thy flock is scattered
on the hills!  The wolf teareth them, Oppression stretches his rod over our
land, our country is plowed with swords, and reaped in blood! The echoes of
slaughter reach from hill to hill! Instead of peaceful pipe, the shepherd
bears a sword; the ox goad is turned into a spear!  O when shall our Deliverer
come? The Philistine riots on our flocks, our vintage is gathered by hands
of enemies! Stretch forth thy hand, and save.—Thus prayed Manoa.  The
aged woman walked into the field, and lo, again the angel came!  Clad as a
traveller fresh risen on his journey, she ran and called her husband, who
came and talked with him.—O man of God, said he, thou comest from far!
Let us detain thee while I make ready a kid, that thou mayest sit and eat,
and tell us of thy name and warfare; that when thy sayings <ptr target="tn445.1"/>
come to pass, we may honour thee.  The Angel answered, My name is wonderful;
enquire not after it, seeing it is a secret: but, if thou wilt, offer an offering
unto the Lord.”</p><closer rend="center">THE END.</closer></div3></div2><div2 type="section" id="b3.3"><pb n="446"/><head rend="center">[Further Sketches]</head><head rend="left">[In a Manuscript Fragment]</head><div3 type="sketch" id="b3.3.1"><head rend="center">“then She bore Pale desire . . .”<ptr target="tn446.1"/></head><milestone rend="left" n="1" unit="page"/><p>then She bore Pale desire father of Curiosity a Virgin evern young.

ever so large, or ever so small, which may be removed with the same convenience
as so many easel Pictures; is worthy the consideration of the Rich and those
who have the direction of public Works.  If the Frescos of APELLES, of PROTOGENES,
of RAPHAEL, or MICHAEL ANGELO could have been removed, we might, perhaps,
have them now in England.  I could divide Westminster Hall, or the walls of
any other great Building, into compartments and ornament them with Frescos,
which would be removable at pleasure.</p><p>Oil will not drink or absorb Colour enough to stand the test of very
little Time and of the Air; it grows yellow, and at length brown.  It was
never generally used till after VANDYKE'S time.  All the little old Pictures,
called cabinet Pictures, are in Fresco, and not in Oil.</p><p>Fresco Painting is properly Miniature, or Enamel Painting; every thing
in Fresco is as high finished as Miniature or Enamel, although in Works larger
than Life.  The Art has been lost: I have recovered it.  How this was done,
will be told, together with the whole Process, in a Work on Art, now in the
Press.  The ignorant Insults of Individuals will not hinder me from doing
my duty to my Art.  Fresco Painting, as it is now practised, is like most
other things, the contrary of what it pretends to be.</p><p>  The execution of my Designs, being all in Water-colours, (that is in
Fresco) are regularly refused to be exhibited by the <hi rend="i">Royal Academy
</hi>, and the <hi rend="i">British Institution</hi> has,  this year, followed
its example, and has effectually excluded me  by this Resolution; I therefore
invite those Noblemen and  Gentlem<supplied>[e]</supplied>n, who are its Subscribers,
to inspect what they have  excluded: and those who have been told that my
Works are<pb n="528"/> but an unscientific and irregular Eccentricity, a Madman's
Scrawls, I demand of them to do me the justice to examine before they decide.
</p><p>  There cannot be more than two or three great Painters or Poets in any
Age or Country; and these, in a corrupt state of Society, are easily excluded,
but not so easily obstructed.  They have ex<supplied>[c]</supplied>luded Watercolours;
it is therefore become necessary that I should exhibit to the Public, in an
Exhibition of my own, my Designs, Painted in Watercolours.  If Italy is enriched
and made great by RAPHAEL, if MICHAEL ANGELO is its supreme glory, if Art
is the glory of a Nation, if Genius and Inspiration are the great Origin and
Bond of Society, the distinction my Works have obtained from those who best
understand such things, calls for my Exhibition as the greatest of Duties
to my Country.</p><closer rend="left"><dateline><date><add>&lt;May 15. 1809&gt;</add></date></dateline></closer><closer rend="right"><signed><hi rend="i">WILLIAM BLAKE</hi></signed></closer></div3></div2><div2 type="section" id="b8.2"><head rend="left"><supplied>[Advertisement of the Catalogue]</supplied></head><head rend="center">A Descriptive Catalogue of <lb/>Blake's Exhibition,</head><head rend="center">At No. 28, Corner of <lb/>BROAD-STREET <lb/>GOLDEN-SQUARE.

Angelo and Rafael, ought to be modest and to doubt its own powers.  Connoisseurs
talk as if Rafael and Michael Angelo had never seen the colouring of Titian
or Correggio: They ought to know that Correggio was born two years before
Michael Angelo, and Titian but four years after.  Both Rafael and Michael
Angelo knew the Venetian, and contemned and rejected all he did with the utmost
disdain, as that which is fabricated for the purpose to destroy art.</p><p>  Mr. B. appeals to the Public, from the judgment of those narrow blinking
eyes, that have too long governed art in a dark corner.  The eyes of stupid
cunning never will be <milestone rend="inline" n="[iv]" unit="page"/> pleased
with the work any more than with the look of self-devoting genius.  The quarrel
of the Florentine with the Venetian is not because he does not understand
Drawing, but because he does not understand Colouring.  How should he? he
who does not know how to draw a hand or a foot, know how to colour it.</p><p>  Colouring does not depend on where the Colours are put, but on where
the lights and darks are put, and all depends on Form or Outline<pb n="530"/>On
where that is put; where that is wrong, the Colouring never can be right;
and it is always wrong in Titian and Correggio, Rubens and Rembrandt.  Till
we get rid of Titian and Correggio, Rubens and Rembrandt, We never shall equal
Rafael and Albert Durer, Michael Angelo, and Julio Romano.</p></div3><div3 id="b8.3.3"><milestone rend="left" n="1" unit="page"/><head rend="center">DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGUE, <lb/>&amp;C. &amp;C.</head><lb rend="hardrule"/><div4 n="1" type="entry" id="b8.3.3.1"><head rend="center"> NUMBER I.</head><p><hi rend="i">The spiritual form of Nelson guiding Leviathan, in whose

 Clear colours unmudded by oil, and firm and determinate lineaments unbroken
by shadows, which ought to display and not to hide form, as is the practice
of the latter Schools of Italy and Flanders.</p></div4><div4 n="2" type="entry" id="b8.3.3.2"><milestone rend="left" n="2" unit="page"/><head rend="center">NUMBER II, ITS COMPANION <ptr target="tn530.2"/></head><p><hi rend="i">The spiritual form of Pitt, guiding Behemoth; he is that 
Angel who, pleased to perform the Almighty's orders, rides on the  whirlwind,
directing the storms of war: He is ordering the Reaper  to reap the Vine of
the Earth, and the Plowman to plow up the  Cities and Towers.</hi></p><p>This Picture also is a proof of the power of colours unsullied with oil
or with any cloggy vehicle.  Oil has falsely been supposed to give strength
to colours: but a little consideration must shew the fallacy of this opinion.
 Oil will not drink or absorb colour enough to stand the test of very little
time and of the air.  It deadens every colour it is mixed with, at its first
mixture, and in a little time becomes a yellow mask over all that it touches.
 Let the works of modern Artists since Rubens' time<milestone rend="inline" n="3" unit="page"/> witness the villany of some one at that time, who first
brought oil Painting into general opinion and practice: since which we have
never had a Picture painted, that could shew itself by the side of an earlier
production.  Whether Rubens or Vandyke, or both, were guilty of this villany,
is to be enquired in another work on Painting, and who first forged the silly
story and known falshood, about John of Bruges inventing oil colours: in the
mean time let it be observed, that before Vandyke's time, and in his time
all the genuine Pictures are on Plaster or Whiting grounds and none since.
</p><p>  The two Pictures of Nelson and Pitt are compositions of a mythological
cast, similar to those Apotheoses of Persian, Hindoo, and Egyptian Antiquity,
which are still preserved on rude monuments, being copies from some stupendous
originals now lost or perhaps buried till<pb n="531"/> some happier age.  The
Artist having been <milestone rend="inline" n="4" unit="page"/> taken in vision
into the ancient republics, monarchies, and patriarchates of Asia, has seen
those wonderful originals called in the Sacred Scriptures the Cherubim, which
were sculptured and painted on walls of Temples, Towers, Cities, Palaces,
and erected in the highly cultivated states of Egypt, Moab, Edom, Aram, among
the Rivers of Paradise, being originals from which the Greeks and Hetrurians
copied Hercules, Farnese, Venus of Medicis, Apollo Belvidere, and all the
grand works of ancient art.  They were executed in a very superior style to
those justly admired copies, being with their accompaniments terrific and
grand in the highest degree.  The Artist has endeavoured to emulate the grandeur
of those seen in his vision, and to apply it to modern Heroes, on a smaller
scale.</p><p>  No man can believe that either Homer's Mythology, or Ovid's, were the
production of Greece, or of Latium; neither will any one<milestone rend="inline" n="5" unit="page"/> believe, that the Greek statues, as they are called, were
the invention of Greek Artists; perhaps the Torso is the only original work
remaining; all the rest are evidently copies, though fine ones, from greater
works of the Asiatic Patriarchs. The Greek Muses are daughters of Mnemosyne,
or Memory, and not of Inspiration or Imagination, therefore not authors of
such sublime conceptions.  Those wonderful originals seen in my visions, were
some of them one hundred feet in height; some were painted as pictures, and
some carved as basso relievos, and some as groupes of statues, all containing
mythological and recondite meaning, where more is meant than meets the eye.
 The Artist wishes it was now the fashion to make such monuments, and then
he should not doubt of having a national commission to execute these two Pictures
on a scale that is suitable to the grandeur of the nation, who is the parent
of his heroes, in high <milestone rend="inline" n="6" unit="page"/> finished
fresco, where the colours would be as pure and as permanent as precious stones
though the figures were one hundred feet in height.</p><p>  All Frescos are as high finished as miniatures or enamels, and they are
known to be unchangeable; but oil being a body itself, will drink or absorb
very little colour, and changing yellow, and at length brown, destroys every
colour it is mixed with, especially every delicate colour.  It turns every
permanent white to a yellow and brown putty, and has compelled the use of
that destroyer of colour, white lead; which, when its protecting oil is evaporated,
will become lead again.  This is an awful things to say to oil Painters; they
may call it madness, but it is true.  All the genuine old little Pictures,
called Cabinet Pictures, are in fresco and not in oil, Oil was not used except
by blundering ignorance, till after Vandyke's time, but the art of fresco
painting <milestone rend="inline" n="5" unit="page"/> being lost, oil became
a fetter to genius, and a dungeon to art.  But one convincing proof among
many others, that these assertions are true is, that real gold and silver
cannot be used with oil, as they are in all the old pictures and in Mr. B.'s
frescos.</p></div4><div4 n="3" type="entry" id="b8.3.3.3"><pb n="532"/><head rend="center">NUMBER III.</head><p><hi rend="i">Sir Jeffery Chaucer and the nine and twenty Pilgrims on their
journey to Canterbury</hi>.</p><p>THE time chosen is early morning, before sunrise, when the jolly company
are just quitting the Tabarde Inn.  The Knight and Squire with the Squire's
Yeoman lead the Procession, next follow the youthful Abbess, her nun and three
priests; her greyhounds attend her. <quote><lg><l n="1">”Of small hounds had she that she fed</l><l n="2">”With roast flesh, milk and wastel bread.“</l></lg></quote>  Next follow the Friar and Monk; then the Tapiser, the Pardoner,
and the Somner and Manciple.  After these <quote>“Our Host,”</quote>
who oc<milestone rend="inline" n="8" unit="page"/>cupies the center of the
cavalcade; directs them to the Knight as the person who would be likely to
commence their task of each telling a tale in their order.  After the Host
follow the Shipman, the Haberdasher, the Dyer, the Franklin, the Physician,
the Plowman, the Lawyer, the poor Parson, the Merchant, the Wife of Bath,
the Miller, the Cook, the Oxford Scholar, Chaucer himself, and the Reeve comes
as Chaucer has described:  <quote><lg><l n="1">“And ever he rode hinderest of the rout.”</l></lg></quote>  These last are issuing from the gateway of the Inn; the Cook
and the Wife of Bath are both taking their morning's draught of comfort. 
Spectators stand at the gateway of the Inn, and are composed of an old Man,
a Woman and Children.   The Landscape is an eastward view of the country,
from the Tabarde Inn, in Southwark, as it may be supposed to have  appeared
in <milestone rend="inline" n="9" unit="page"/> Chaucer's time; interspersed
with cottages and  villages; the first beams of the Sun are seen above the
horizon;  some buildings and spires indicate the situation of the great  City;
the Inn is a gothic building, which Thynne in his Glossary  says was the lodging
of the Abbot of Hyde, by Winchester.  On  the Inn is inscribed its title,
and a proper advantage is taken  of this circumstance to describe the subject
of the Picture.   The words written over the gateway of the Inn, are as follow:“The
Tabarde Inn, by Henry Baillie, the lodgynge-house for  Pilgrims, who journey
to Saint Thomas's Shrine at Canterbury.”</p><p> The characters of Chaucer's Pilgrims are the characters which compose
all ages and nations: as one age falls, another rises, different to mortal
sight, but to immortals only the same; for we see the same characters repeated
again and again, in animals, vegetables, minerals, and in men; nothing new
occurs in iden<milestone rend="inline" n="10" unit="page"/>tical existence;
Accident ever varies, Substance can never suffer change nor decay.</p><p>  Of Chaucer's characters, as described in his Canterbury Tales, some of
the names or titles are altered by time, but the characters themselves for
ever remain unaltered, and  consequently they are the<pb n="533"/> physiognomies
or lineaments of universal human life, beyond which Nature never steps.  Names
alter, things never alter.  I have known multitudes of those who would have
been monks in the age of monkery, who in this deistical age are deists.  As
Newton numbered the stars, and as Linneus numbered the plants, so Chaucer
numbered the classes of men.</p><p>The Painter has consequently varied the heads and forms of his personages
into all Nature's varieties; the Horses he has also varied to accord to their
Riders, the Costume is correct according to authentic monuments.</p><p>  The Knight and Squire with the Squire's <milestone rend="inline" n="11" unit="page"/> Yeoman lead the procession, as Chaucer has also placed them first
in his prologue.  The Knight is a true Hero, a good, great, and wise man;
his whole length portrait on horseback, as written by Chaucer, cannot be surpassed.
 He has spent his life in the field; has ever been a conqueror, and is that
species of character which in every age stands as the guardian of man against
the oppressor.  His son is like him with the germ of perhaps greater perfection
still, as he blends literature and  the arts with his warlike studies.  Their
dress and their horses  are of the first rate, without ostentation, and with
all the  true grandeur that unaffected simplicity when in high rank  always
displays.  The Squire's Yeoman is also a great character,  a man perfectly
knowing in his profession: <quote><lg><l n="1">“And in his hand he bare a mighty bow.”</l></lg></quote></p><p>Chaucer describes here a mighty man; one who in war is the worthy attendant
on noble heroes.</p><p><milestone rend="inline" n="12" unit="page"/>The Prioress follows these
with her female chaplain. <quote><lg><l n="1">     “Another Nonne also with her had she, </l><l n="2">   “That was her Chaplaine and Priests three.”</l></lg></quote></p><p>This Lady is described also as of the first rank; rich and honoured.
She has certain peculiarities and little delicate affectations, not unbecoming
in her, being accompanied with what is truly grand and really polite; her
person and face, Chaucer has described with minuteness; it is very elegant,
and was the beauty of our ancestors, till after Elizabeth's time, when voluptuousness
and folly began to be accounted beautiful.</p><p>Her companion and her three priests were no doubt all perfectly delineated
in those parts of Chaucer's work which are now lost; we ought to suppose them
suitable attendants on rank and fashion.</p><p><milestone rend="inline" n="13" unit="page"/> The Monk follows these with
the Friar.  The Painter has also grouped with these, the Pardoner and the
Sompnour and the Manciple, and has here also introduced one of the rich citizens
of London.  Characters likely to ride in company, all being above the common
rank in life or attendants on those who were so.</p><p>  For the Monk is described by Chaucer, as a man of the first rank<pb n="534"/>in
society, noble, rich, and expensively attended: he is a leader of the age,
with certain humourous accompaniments in his character, that do not degrade,
but render him an object of dignified mirth, but also with other accompaniments
not so respectable.</p><p>  The Friar is a character also of a mixed kind. <quote><lg><l n="1"> “A friar there was, a wanton and a merry.”</l></lg></quote><supplied>[B]</supplied>ut in his office he is said to be a <quote>“full solemn man:”</quote> eloquent, amorous, witty, and satyri<milestone rend="inline" n="14" unit="page"/>cal; young, handsome, and rich; he is a complete
rogue; with constitutional gaiety enough to make him a master of all the pleasures
of the world.  <quote><lg><l n="1">“His neck was white as the flour de lis, </l><l n="2">Thereto strong he was as a champioun.”</l></lg></quote></p><p>It is necessary here to speak of Chaucer's own character, that I may
set certain mistaken critics right in their conception of the humour and fun
that occurs on the journey.  Chaucer is himself the great poetical observer
of men, who in every age is born to record and eternize its acts.  This he
does as a master, as a father, and superior, who looks down on their little
follies from the Emperor to the Miller; sometimes with severity, oftener with
joke and sport.</p><p>  Accordingly Chaucer has made his Monk a great tragedian, one who studied
poetical art. <milestone rend="inline" n="15" unit="page"/> So much so, that
the generous Knight is, in the compassionate dictates of his soul, compelled
to cry out <quote><lg><l n="1">       “Ho quoth the Knyght, good Sir, no more of this,</l><l n="2">      That ye have said, is right ynough I wis;</l><l n="3">     And mokell more, for little heaviness,</l><l n="4">      Is right enough for much folk as I guesse.</l><l n="5">      I say for me, it is a great disease,</l><l n="6">      Whereas men have been in wealth and ease;</l><l n="7">     To heare of their sudden fall alas,</l><l n="8">     And the contrary is joy and solas.”</l></lg></quote></p><p> The Monk's definition of tragedy in the proem to his tale is worth repeating: <quote><lg><l n="1">            “Tragedie is to tell a certain story,</l><l n="2">          As old books us maken memory;</l><l n="3">          Of hem that stood in great prosperity.</l><l n="4">         And be fallen out of high degree,</l><l n="5">         Into miserie and ended wretchedly.”</l></lg></quote></p><p><milestone rend="inline" n="16" unit="page"/> Though a man of luxury, pride
and pleasure, he is a master of art and learning, though affecting to despise
it. Those who can think that the proud Huntsman, and noble Housekeeper, Chaucer's
Monk, is intended for a buffoon or burlesque character, know little of Chaucer.
</p><pb n="535"/><p>For the Host who follows this group, and holds the center  of the cavalcade,
is a first rate character, and his jokes are  no trifles; they are always,
though uttered with audacity, and equally free with the Lord and the Peasant,
they are always substantially and weightily expressive of knowledge and experience;
Henry Baillie, the keeper of the greatest Inn, of  the greatest City; for
such was the Tabarde Inn in Southwark,  near London: our Host was also a leader
of the age.</p><p>  By way of illustration, I instance Shakspeare's Witches in Macbeth. 
Those who dress <milestone rend="inline" n="17" unit="page"/> them for the
stage, consider them as wretched old women, and not as Shakspeare intended,
the Goddesses of Destiny; this shews how Chaucer has been misunderstood in
his sublime work.  Shakspeare's Fairies also  are the rulers of the vegetable
world, and so are Chaucer's;  let them be so considered, and then the poet
will be understood,  and not else.</p><p>But I have omitted to speak of a very prominent character, the Pardoner,
the Age's Knave, who always commands and domineers over the high and low vulgar.
 This man is sent in every age for a rod and scourge, and for a blight, for
a trial of men, to divide the classes of men, he is in the most holy sanctuary,
and he is suffered by Providence for wise ends, and has also his great use,
and his grand leading destiny.</p><p>  His companion the Sompnour, is also a Devil of the first magnitude, grand,
terrific, rich and honoured in the rank of which he holds <milestone rend="inline" n="18" unit="page"/> the destiny.  The uses to society are perhaps equal of
the Devil and of the Angel, their sublimity who can dispute. <quote><lg><l n="1">            “In daunger had he at his own gise,</l><l n="2">          The young girls of his diocese,</l><l n="3">         And he knew well their counsel, &amp;c.”</l></lg></quote></p><p>  The principal figure in the next groupe, is the Good  Parson; an Apostle,
a real Messenger of Heaven, sent in every  age for its light and its warmth.
 This man is beloved and  venerated by all, and neglected by all: He serves
all, and is  served by none; he is, according to Christ's definition, the
 greatest of his age.  Yet he is a Poor Parson of a town.  Read  Chaucer's
description of the Good Parson, and bow the head and  the knee to him, who,
in every age sends us such a burning and a  shining light.  Search O ye rich
and powerful, for these men and  obey their counsel, then <milestone rend="inline" n="19" unit="page"/> shall the golden age return: But  alas! you will not easily
distinguish him from the Friar or the  Pardoner, they also are <quote>“full
solemn men,”</quote> and their counsel, you  will continue to follow.
</p><p>I have placed by his side, the Sergeant at Lawe, who appears delighted
to ride in his company, and between him and his brother, the Plowman; as I
wish men of Law would always ride with them, and take their counsel, especially
in all difficult points. Chaucer's Lawyer is a character of great venerableness,
a judge, and a real master of the jurisprudence of his age.</p><pb n="536"/><p>  The Doctor of Physic is in this groupe, and the Franklin, the voluptuous
country gentleman, contrasted with the Physician, and on his other hand, with
two Citizens of London.  Chaucer's characters live age after age.  Every age
is a Canterbury Pilgrimage; we all pass on, each sustaining one or other <milestone rend="inline" n="20" unit="page"/>  of these characters; nor can a child be
born, who is not one of these characters of Chaucer, The Doctor of Physic
is described as the first of his profession; perfect, learned, completely
Master and Doctor in his art.  Thus the reader will observe, that Chaucer
makes every one of his characters perfect in his kind, every one is an Antique
Statue; the image of a class, and not of an imperfect individual.</p><p>This groupe also would furnish substantial matter, on which volumes might
be written.  The Franklin is one who keeps open table, who is the genius of
eating and drinking, the Bacchus; as the Doctor of Physic is the Esculapius,
the Host is the Silenus, the Squire is the Apollo, the Miller is the Hercules,
&amp;c. Chaucer's characters are a description of the eternal Principles that
exist in all ages.  The Franklin is voluptuousness itself most nobly pourtrayed:</p><milestone rend="left" n="21" unit="page"/><p><quote><lg><l n="1">“It snewed in his house of meat and drink.”</l></lg></quote></p><p>  The Plowman is simplicity itself, with wisdom and strength for its stamina.
 Chaucer has divided the ancient character of Hercules between his Miller
and his Plowman.  Benevolence is the plowman's great characteristic, he is
thin with excessive labour, and not with old age, as some have supposed. <quote><lg><l n="1">“He would thresh and thereto dike and delve</l><l n="2">For Christe's sake, for every poore wight,</l><l/><l n="3">Withouten hire, if it lay in his might.”</l></lg></quote></p><p>  Visions of these eternal principles or characters of human life appear
to poets, in all ages; the Grecian gods were the ancient Cherubim of Phoenicia;
but the Greeks, and since them the Moderns, have neglected to subdue the gods
of Priam.  These Gods are visions of the eternal attributes, or divine names,
which, when <milestone rend="inline" n="22" unit="page"/> erected into gods,
become destructive to humanity. They ought to be the servants, and not the
masters of man, or of society.  They ought to be made to sacrifice to Man,
and not man compelled to sacrifice to them; for when separated from man or
humanity, who is Jesus the Saviour, the vine of eternity, they are thieves
and rebels, they are destroyers.</p><p>The Plowman of Chaucer is Hercules in his supreme eternal state, divested
of his spectrous shadow; which is the Miller, a terrible fellow, such as exists
in all times and places, for the trial of men, to astonish every neighbourhood,
with brutal strength and courage, to get rich and powerful to curb the pride
of Man.</p><p>  The Reeve and the Manciple are two characters of the most consummate<pb n="537"/> worldly wisdom.  The Shipman, or Sailor, is a similar  genius of
Ulyssean art; but with the highest courage superadded.</p><p>  The Citizens and their Cook are each leaders <milestone rend="inline" n="23" unit="page"/> of a class.  Chaucer has been somehow made to number four
citizens, which would make his whole company, himself included, thirty- one.
 But he says there was but nine and twenty in his company. <quote><lg><l n="1"> “Full nine and twenty in a company.”</l></lg></quote></p><p>  The Webbe, or Weaver, and the Tapiser, or Tapestry Weaver, appear to
me to be the same person; but this is only an opinion, for full nine and twenty
may signify one more or less.  But I dare say that Chaucer wrote <quote>“A
Webbe Dyer,”</quote> that is a Cloth Dyer. <quote><lg><l n="1">“A Webbe Dyer and a Tapiser.”</l></lg></quote></p><p>The Merchant cannot be one of the Three Citizens, as his dress is different,
and his character is more marked, whereas Chaucer says of his rich citizens:</p><milestone rend="left" n="24" unit="page"/><quote><lg><l n="1">  “All were yclothed in o liverie.”</l></lg></quote><p>  The characters of Women Chaucer has divided into two classes, the Lady
Prioress and the Wife of Bath.  Are not these leaders of the ages of men?
The lady prioress, in some ages, predominates; and in some the wife of Bath,
in whose character Chaucer has been equally minute and exact; because she
is also a scourge and a blight.  I shall say no more of her, nor expose what
Chaucer has left hidden; let the young reader study what he has said of her:
it is useful as a scare-crow.  There are of such characters born too many
for the peace of the world.   I come at length to the Clerk of Oxenford. 
This character varies from that of Chaucer, as the contemplative philosopher
varies from the poetical genius.  There are always these two classes of learned
sages, the poetical and the philosophical. The painter has put them side by
side, as if the youthful clerk had put him<milestone rend="inline" n="25" unit="page"/>self under the tuition of the mature poet.  Let the Philosopher
always be the servant and scholar of inspiration and all will be happy.</p><p>  Such are the characters that compose this Picture, which was painted
in self-defence against the insolent and envious imputation of unfitness for
finished and scientific art; and this imputation, most artfully and industriously
endeavoured to be propagated among the public by ignorant hirelings.  The
painter courts comparison with his competitors, who, having received fourteen
hundred guineas and more from the profits of his designs, in that well-known
work, Designs for Blair's Grave, have left him to shift for himself, while
others, more obedient to an employer's opinions and directions, are employed,
at a great expence, to produce works, in succession to his, by which they
acquired public patronage.  This has hitherto been his lot--to get patronage
for<pb n="538"/> others and then to be left and neglected, and his work, which
gained <milestone rend="inline" n="26" unit="page"/> that patronage, cried
down as eccentricity and madness; as unfinished and neglected by the artist's
violent temper, he is sure the works now exhibited, will give the lie to such
aspersions.</p><p>Those who say that men are led by interest are knaves.  A knavish character
will often say, of what interest is it to me to do so and so? I answer, of
none at all, but the contrary, as you well know.  It is of malice and envy
that you have done this; hence I am aware of you, because I know that you
act not from interest but from malice, even to your own destruction.  It is
therefore become a duty which Mr. B. owes to the Public, who have always recognized
him, and patronized him, however hidden by artifices, that he should not suffer
such things to be done or be hindered from the public Exhibition of his finished
productions by any calumnies in future.</p><p>  The character and expression in this picture could never have been produced
with Ruben's <milestone rend="inline" n="27" unit="page"/> light and shadow,
or with Rembrandt's, or any thing Venetian or Flemish.  The Venetian and Flemish
practice is broken lines, broken masses, and broken colours.  Mr. B.'s practice
is unbroken lines, unbroken masses, and unbroken colours.  Their art is to
lose form, his art is to find form, and to keep it.  His arts are opposite
to theirs in all things.</p><p>  As there is a class of men, whose whole delight is in the destruction
of men, so there is a class of artists, whose whole art and science is fabricated
for the purpose of destroying art. Who these are is soon known: <quote>“by
their works ye shall know them.”</quote> All who endeavour to raise
up a style against Rafael, Mich. Angelo, and the Antique; those who separate
Painting from Drawing; who look if a picture is well Drawn; and, if it is,
immediately cry out, that it cannot be well Coloured-- those are the men.
</p><p>  But to shew the stupidity of this class of <milestone rend="inline" n="28" unit="page"/> men, nothing need be done but to examine my rival's prospectus.
  The two first characters in Chaucer, the Knight and the Squire, he has put
among his rabble; and indeed his prospectus calls the Squire the fop of Chaucer's
age.  Now hear Chaucer. <quote><lg><l n="1">     “Of his Stature, he was of even length,</l><l n="2">     And wonderly deliver, and of great strength;</l><l n="3">     And he had be sometime in Chivauchy,</l><l n="4">     In Flanders, in Artois, and in Picardy,</l><l n="5">    And borne him well as of so litele space.”</l></lg></quote> Was this a fop? <quote><lg><l n="1"> “Well could he sit a horse, and faire ride,</l><l n="2"> He could songs make, and eke well indite </l><l n="3"> Just, and eke dance, pourtray, and well write.</l></lg></quote> Was this a fop?</p><pb n="539"/><milestone rend="left" n="29" unit="page"/><p><quote><lg><l n="1">  “Curteis he was, and meek, and serviceable;</l><l n="2">  And kerft before his fader at the table.”</l></lg></quote> Was this a fop?</p><p>It is the same with all his characters; he has done all by chance, or
perhaps his fortune, money, money.  According to his prospectus he has Three
Monks; these he cannot find in Chaucer, who has only One Monk, and that no
vulgar character, as he has endeavoured to make him.  When men cannot read
they should not pretend to paint.  To be sure Chaucer is a little difficult
to him who has only blundered over novels and catchpenny trifles of booksellers.
 Yet a little pains ought to be taken even by the ignorant and weak.  He has
put The Reeve, a vulgar fellow, between his Knight and Squire, as if he was
resolved to go contrary in every thing to Chaucer, who says of the Reeve:</p><milestone rend="left" n="30" unit="page"/><p><quote><lg><l n="1"> “And ever he rode hinderest of the rout.”</l></lg></quote></p><p> In this manner he has jumbled his dumb dollies together, and is praised
by his equals for it; for both himself and his friend are equally masters
of Chaucer's language.  They both think that the Wife of Bath is a young beautiful
blooming damsel; and H<supplied>[oppner]</supplied> says, that she is the
Fair Wife of Bath, and that the Spring appears in her Cheeks.  Now hear what
Chaucer has made her say of herself, who is no modest one, <quote><lg><l n="1">       “But Lord when it remembereth me</l><l n="2">      Upon my youth and on my jollity,</l><l n="3">      It tickleth me about the heart root.</l><l n="4">     Unto this day it doth my heart boot,</l><l n="5">     That I have had my world as in my time;</l><l n="6">      But age, alas, that all will envenime,</l><l n="7">     Hath me bireft, my beauty and my pith</l><l n="8">     Let go; farewell: the devil go therewith,</l></lg></quote></p><milestone rend="left" n="31" unit="page"/><p><quote><lg><l n="1">       The flower is gone, there is no more to tell.</l><l n="2">      The bran, as best, I can, I now mote sell;</l><l n="3">      And yet, to be right merry, will I fond,</l><l n="4">      Now forth to tell of my fourth husband.”</l></lg></quote></p><p>She has had four husbands, a fit subject for this painter; yet the painter
ought to be very much offended with his friend H----,  who has called his
”a common scene,” “and very ordinary forms;”  which
is the truest part of all, for it is so, and very  wretchedly so indeed. 
What merit can there be in a picture of  which such words are spoken with
truth.</p><pb n="540"/><p>  But the prospectus says that the Painter has represented Chaucer himself
as a knave, who thrusts himself among honest people, to make game of and laugh
at them; though I must do justice to the painter, and say that he has made
him look more like a fool than a knave.  But it appears, in all the writings
of Chaucer, and particularly in his Canterbury Tales, that <milestone rend="inline" n="32" unit="page"/> he was very devout, and paid respect to true enthusiastic
superstition.  He has laughed at his knaves and fools as I do now.  But he
has respected his True Pilgrims, who are a majority of his company, and are
not thrown together in the random manner that Mr. S<supplied>[tothard]</supplied>
has done.  Chaucer has no where called the Plowman old, worn out with age
and labour, as the prospectus has represented him, and says, that the picture
has done so too.  He is worn down with labour, but not with age.  How spots
of brown and yellow, smeared about at random, can be either young or old,
I cannot see.  It may be an old man; it may be a young one; it may be any
thing that a prospectus pleases.  But I know that where there are no lineaments
there can be no character.  And what connoisseurs call touch, I know by experience,
must be the destruction of all character and expression, as it is of every
lineament.</p><p>  The scene of Mr. S------'s Picture is by <milestone rend="inline" n="33" unit="page"/> Dulwich  Hills, which was not the way to Canterbury; but, perhaps
the  painter thought he would give them a ride round about, because  they
were a burlesque set of scare-crows, not worth any man's  respect or care.
</p><p>  But the painter's thoughts being always upon gold, he has introduced
a character that Chaucer has not; namely, a Goldsmith; for so the prospectus
tells us.  Why he has introduced a Goldsmith, and what is the wit of it, the
prospectus does not explain.  But it takes care to mention the reserve and
modesty of the Painter; this makes a good epigram enough.   <quote><lg><l n="1">“The fox, the owl, the spider, and the mole,</l><l n="2">By sweet reserve and modesty get fat.”</l></lg></quote></p><p>  But the prospectus tells us, that the painter has introduced a Sea Captain;
Chaucer has a Ship-man, a Sailor, a Trading Master of a Ves<milestone rend="inline" n="34" unit="page"/>sel, called by courtesy Captain, as every master of a boat
is; but this does not make him a Sea Captain. Chaucer has purposely omitted
such a personage, as it only exists in certain periods: it is the soldier
by sea.  He who would be a Soldier in inland nations is a sea captain in commercial
nations.</p><p>All is misconceived, and its mis-execution is equal to its misconception.
 I have no objection to Rubens and Rembrandt being employed, or even to their
living in a palace; but it shall not be at the expence of Rafael and Michael

of representing spirits with real bodies, would do well to consider that the
Venus, the Minerva, the Jupiter, the Apollo, which they admire in Greek sta<milestone rend="inline" n="38" unit="page"/>tues, are all of them representations of
spiritual existences of God's immortal, to the mortal perishing organ of sight;
and yet they are embodied and organized in solid marble.  Mr. B. requires
the same latitude and all is well.  The Prophets describe what they saw in
Vision as real and existing men whom they saw with their imaginative and immortal
organs; the Apostles the same; the clearer the organ the more distinct the
object.  A Spirit and a Vision are not, as the  modern philosophy supposes,
a cloudy vapour or a nothing: they are organized and minutely articulated
beyond all that the mortal and perishing nature can produce.  He who does
not imagine in stronger and better lineaments, and in stronger and better
light than his perishing mortal eye can see does not imagine at all.  The
painter of this work asserts that all his imaginations appear to him infinitely
more perfect and more minutely organized than any thing seen by his<pb n="542"/>mortal
eye.  Spi<milestone rend="inline" n="38" unit="page"/>rits are organized men:

these were the Strongest Man, the Beautifullest Man, and the Ugliest Man;
these three marched through the field unsubdued, as Gods, and the Sun of Britain
s<supplied>[e]</supplied>t, but shall arise again with tenfold splendor when
Arthur shall awake from sleep, and resume his dominion over earth and ocean.
</hi></p><p>  The three general classes of men who are represented by the most Beautiful,
the most Strong, and the most Ugly, could not be represented by any historical
facts but those of our own country, the Ancient Britons; without violating
costume.  The Britons (say historians) were naked civilized men, learned,
studious, abstruse in thought and contemplation; naked, simple, plain, in
their acts and manners; <milestone rend="inline" n="40" unit="page"/> wiser
than after-ages.  They were overwhelmed by brutal arms all but a small remnant;
Strength, Beauty, and Ugliness escaped the wreck, and remain for ever unsubdued,
age after age.</p><p>  The British Antiquities are now in the Artist's hands; all his visionary
contemplations, relating to his own country and its ancient glory, when it
was as it again shall be, the source of learning and inspiration.  Arthur
was a name for the constellation Arcturus, or Bootes, the Keeper of the North
Pole. And all the fables of Arthur and his round table; of the warlike naked
Britons; of Merlin; of Arthur's conquest of the whole world; of his death,
or sleep, and promise to return again; of the Druid monuments, or temples;
of the pavement of Watlingstreet; of London stone; of the caverns in Cornwall,
Wales, Derbyshire, and Scotland; of the Giants of Ireland and Britain; of
the elemental beings, called <milestone rend="inline" n="41" unit="page"/>by
us by the general name of Fairies; and of these three who escaped, namely,
Beauty, Strength, and Ugliness, Mr. B. has in his hands poems of the highest
antiquity.  Adam was a Druid, and Noah; also Abraham was called to succeed
the Druidical<pb n="543"/> age, which began to turn allegoric and mental signification
into  corporeal command,  whereby human sacrifice would have  depopulated
the earth.  All these things are written in Eden.   The artist is an inhabitant
of that happy country, and if  every thing goes on as it has begun, the world
of vegetation  and generation may expect to be opened again to Heaven,  through
Eden, as it was in the beginning. </p><p>  The Strong man represents the human sublime.  The Beautiful  man represents
the human pathetic, which was in the wars of Eden  divided into male and female.
 The Ugly  man represents the human  reason.  They were originally one man,
who was fourfold; he was  self-divided, and <milestone rend="inline" n="42" unit="page"/> his real humanity slain on the stems of generation, and the form
of the fourth was like the Son  of God.  How he became divided is a subject
of great sublimity  and pathos.  The Artist has written it under inspiration,
and  will, if God please, publish it; it is voluminous, and contains  the
ancient history of Britain, and the world of Satan and of  Adam.</p><p>  In the mean time he has painted this Picture, which supposes that in
the reign of that British Prince, who lived in the fifth century, there were
remains of those naked Heroes, in the Welch Mountains; they are there now,
Gray saw them in the person of his bard on Snowdon; there they dwell in naked
simplicity; happy is he who can see and converse with them above the shadows
of generation and death.  The giant Albion, was Patriarch of the Atlantic,
he is the Atlas of the Greeks, one of those the Greeks called Titans.  The
stories of Arthur are the acts of Albion, ap<milestone rend="inline" n="43" unit="page"/>plied to a Prince of the fifth century, who conquered Europe,
and held the Empire of the world in the dark age, which the Romans never again
recovered.  In this Picture, believing with Milton, the ancient British History,
Mr. B. has done, as all the ancients did, and as all the moderns, who are
worthy of fame, given the historical fact in its poetical vigour; so as it
always happens, and not in that dull way that some Historians pretend, who
being weakly organized themselves, cannot see either miracle or prodigy; all
is to them a dull round of probabilities and possibilities; but the history
of all times and places, is nothing else but improbabilities and impossibilities;
what we  should say, was impossible if we did not see it always before our
 eyes.</p><p>  The antiquities of every Nation Under Heaven, is no less sacred than
that of the Jews.  They are the same thing as Jacob Bryant, <milestone rend="inline" n="44" unit="page"/> and all antiquaries have proved.  How other antiquities
came to be neglected and disbelieved, while those of the Jews are collected
and arranged, is an enquiry, worthy of both the Antiquarian and the Divine.
 All had originally one language, and one religion, this was the religion
of Jesus, the everlasting Gospel.  Antiquity preaches the Gospel of Jesus.
 The reasoning historian, turner and twister of causes and consequences, such
as Hume, Gibbon and Voltaire; cannot with all their artifice, turn or twist
one fact or disarrange self evident action<pb n="544"/> and reality.  Reasons
and opinions concerning acts, are not history.  Acts themselves alone are
history, and these are neither the exclusive property of Hume, Gibbon nor
Voltaire, Echard, Rapin, Plutarch, nor Herodotus.  Tell me the Acts, O historian,
and leave me to reason upon them as I please; away with your reasoning and
your rubbish.  All that is not action is not <milestone rend="inline" n="45" unit="page"/> worth reading.  Tell me the What; I do not want you to tell me
the Why, and the How; I can find that out myself, as well as you can, and
I will not be fooled by you into opinions, that you please to impose, to disbelieve
what you think improbable or impossible.  His opinions, who does not see spiritual
agency, is not worth any man's reading; he who rejects a fact because it is
improbable, must reject all History and retain doubts only.</p><p>  It has been said to the Artist, take the Apollo for the model of your
beautiful Man and the Hercules for your strong Man, and the Dancing Fawn for
your Ugly Man.  Now he comes to his trial.  He knows that what he does is
not inferior to the grandest Antiques.  Superior they cannot be, for human
power cannot go beyond either what he does, or what they have done, it is
the gift of God, it is inspiration and vision.  He had resolved to emulate
those <milestone rend="inline" n="46" unit="page"/> precious remains of antiquity,
he has done so and the result you behold; his ideas of strength and beauty
have not been greatly different.  Poetry as it exists now on earth, in the
various remains of ancient authors, Music as it exists in old tunes or melodies,
Painting and Sculpture as it exists in the remains of Antiquity and in the
works of more modern genius, is Inspiration, and cannot be surpassed; it is
perfect and eternal.  Milton, Shakspeare, Michael Angelo, Rafael, the finest
specimens of Ancient Sculpture and Painting, and Architecture, Gothic, Grecian,
Hindoo and Egyptian, are the extent of the human mind.  The human mind cannot
go beyond the gift of God, the Holy Ghost.  To suppose that Art can go beyond
the finest specimens of Art that are now in the world, is not knowing what
Art is; it is being blind to the gifts of the spirit.</p><p><milestone rend="inline" n="47" unit="page"/> It will be necessary for
the Painter to say something concerning his ideas of Beauty, Strength and
Ugliness.</p><p>The Beauty that is annexed and appended to folly, is a lamentable accident
and error of the mortal and perishing life; it does but seldom happen; but
with this unnatural mixture the sublime Artist can have nothing to do; it
is fit for the burlesque.  The Beauty proper for sublime art, is lineaments,
or forms and features that are capable of being the receptacles of intellect;
accordingly the Painter has given in his beautiful man, his own idea of intellectual
Beauty.  The face and limbs that deviates or alters least, from infancy to
old age, is the face and limbs of greatest Beauty and perfection.</p><p>  The Ugly likewise, when accompanied and annexed to imbecility and disease,
is a subject for burlesque and not for historical grandeur; the Artist has
imagined his Ugly man; one <milestone rend="inline" n="48" unit="page"/> approaching
to the <pb n="545"/> beast in features and form, his forehead small, without
frontals;  his jaws large; his nose high on the ridge, and narrow; his chest
 and the stamina of his make, comparatively little, and his joints  and his
extremities large; his eyes with scarce any whites,  narrow and cunning, and
every thing tending toward what is truly  Ugly; the incapability of intellect.
</p><p>The Artist has considered his strong Man as a receptacle of Wisdom, a
sublime energizer; his features and limbs do not spindle out into length,
without strength, nor are they too large and unwieldy for his brain and bosom.
 Strength consists in accumulation of power to the principal seat, and from
thence a regular gradation and subordination; strength is compactness, not
extent nor bulk.</p><p>  The strong Man acts from conscious superiority, and marches on in fearless
dependance on the divine decrees, raging with the inspira<milestone rend="inline" n="49" unit="page"/>tions of a prophetic mind.  The Beautiful Man acts from
duty, and anxious solicitude for the fates of those for whom he combats. 
The Ugly Man acts from love of carnage, and delight in the savage barbarities
of war, rushing with sportive  precipitation into the very teeth of the affrighted
enemy.</p><p>  The Roman Soldiers rolled together in a heap before them: <quote>“Like
the rolling thing before the whirlwind;”</quote> each shew a different
character, and a different expression of fear, or revenge, or envy, or blank
horror, or amazement, or devout wonder and unresisting awe.</p><p>The dead and the dying, Britons naked, mingled with armed Romans, strew
the field beneath.  Among these, the last of the Bards who were capable of
attending warlike deeds, is seen falling, outstretched among the dead and

spirits of forests and floods, in that ancient happy period, which history
has recorded, cannot be like the sickly daubs of Titian or Rubens.  Where
will the copier of nature, as it now is, find a civilized man, who has been
accustomed to go naked.  Imagination only, can furnish us with colouring appropriate,
such as is found in the Frescos of Rafael and Michael Angelo: the disposition
of forms always directs colouring in works of true art.  As to a modern Man
stripped from his load of cloathing, he is like a dead corpse.  Hence Rubens,
Titian, Correggio, and all of that class, are like leather and chalk; their
men are like leather, and their women like chalk, for the disposition of their <milestone rend="inline" n="51" unit="page"/> forms will not admit of grand colouring;
in Mr. B.'s Britons, the blood is seen to circulate in their limbs; he defies
competition in colouring.</p></div4><div4 n="6" type="entry" id="b8.3.3.6"><pb n="546"/><head rend="center"> NUMBER VI.</head><p><hi rend="i">A Spirit vaulting from a cloud to turn and wind a fiery

of those, who worthily are famous;  and as Swedenborg observes, by entering
into disease and  excrement, drunkenness and concupiscence, they possess themselves
of the bodies of mortal men, and shut the doors of mind and of thought, by

without any oily vehicle; it may be worthy of attention, not only on account
of its composition, but of the great labour which has been bestowed on it,
that is, three or four times as much as would have finished a more perfect
Picture; the labor has destroyed the lineaments, it was with difficulty brought
back again to a certain effect, which it had at first, when all the lineaments
were perfect.</p><p>  These Pictures, among numerous others painted for experiment, were the
result of <milestone rend="inline" n="55" unit="page"/> temptations and perturbations,
labouring to destroy Imaginative power, by means of that infernal machine,
called Chiaro Oscuro, in the hands of Venetian and Flemish Demons; whose enmity
to the Painter himself, and to all Artists who study in the Florentine and
Roman Schools, may be removed by an exhibition and exposure of their vile
tricks.  They cause that every thing in art shall become a Machine.  They
cause that the execution shall be all blocked up with brown shadows.  They
put the original Artist in fear and doubt of his own original conception.
 The spirit of Titian was particularly active, in raising doubts concerning
the possibility of executing without a model, and when once he had raised
the doubt, it became easy for him to snatch away the vision time after time,
for when the Artist took his pencil, to execute his ideas, his power of imagination
weakened so much, and darkened, that memory of nature and of Pictures <milestone rend="inline" n="56" unit="page"/> of the various Schools possessed his mind,
instead of appropriate execution, resulting from the inventions; like walking
in another man's style, or speaking or looking in another man's style and
manner, unappropriate and repugnant to your own individual character; tormenting
the true Artist, till he leaves the Florentine, and adopts the Venetian practice,
or does as Mr. B. has done, has the courage to suffer poverty and disgrace,
till he ultimately conquers.</p><p>  Rubens is a most outrageous demon, and by infusing the remembrances of
his Pictures, and style of execution, hinders all power of individual thought:
so that the man who is possessed by this demon, loses all admiration of any
other Artist, but Rubens, and those who were his imitators and journeymen,
he causes to the Florentine and Roman Artist fear to execute; and though the
original conception was all fire and animation, he loads it with<milestone rend="inline" n="57" unit="page"/> hellish brownness, and blocks up all its
gates of light, except one, and that one he closes with iron bars, till the
victim is obliged to give up the Florentine and Roman practice, and adopt
the Venetian and Flemish.</p><pb n="548"/><p>  Correggio is a soft and effeminate and consequently a most cruel demon,
whose whole delight is to cause endless labor to whoever suffers him to enter
his mind.  The story that is told in all Lives of the Painters about Correggio
being poor and but badly paid for his Pictures, is altogether false; he was
a petty Prince, in Italy, and employed numerous journeymen in manufacturing
(as Rubens and Titian did) the Pictures that go under his name.  The manual
labor in these Pictures of Correggio is immense, and was paid for originally
at the immense prices that those who keep manufactories of art always charge
to their employers, while they themselves pay their journeymen little enough.
 But though <milestone rend="inline" n="58" unit="page"/> Correggio was not
poor, he will make any true artist so, who permits him to enter his mind,
and take possession of his affections; he infuses a love of soft and even
tints without boundaries, and of endless reflected lights, that confuse one
another, and hinder all correct drawing from appearing to be correct; for
if one of Rafael or Michael Angelo's figures was to be traced, and Correggio's
reflections and refractions to be added to it, there would soon be an end
of proportion and strength, and it would be weak, and pappy, and lumbering,
and thick headed, like his own works; but then it would have softness and
evenness, by a twelvemonth's labor, where a month would with judgment have
finished it better and higher; and the poor wretch who executed it, would
be the Correggio that the life writers have written of: a drudge and a miserable
man, compelled to softness by poverty.  I say again, O Artist, you may disbe<milestone rend="inline" n="59" unit="page"/>lieve all this, but it shall be at your own

where Naomi having taken leave of her daughters  in law, with intent to return
to her own country; Ruth cannot  leave  her, but says, “Whither <milestone rend="inline" n="62" unit="page"/> thou goest I will go; and  where thou lodgest
I will lodge, thy people shall be my people,  and thy God my God: where thou
diest I will die, and there will  I be buried; God do so to me and more also,
if ought but death  part thee and me.”</p><p> The distinction that is made in modern times between a Painting and a
Drawing  proceeds from ignorance of art.  The  merit of a Picture is the same
as the merit of a Drawing.  The  dawber dawbs his Drawings; he who draws his
Drawings draws  his Pictures.  There is no difference between Rafael's Cartoons
and his Frescos, or Pictures, except that the Frescos, or Pictures,  are more
finished.  When Mr. B. formerly painted in oil colours  his Pictures were
shewn to certain painters and connoisseurs, who  said that they were very
admirable Drawings on canvass; but not  Pictures: but they said the same of
Rafael's Pictures. <milestone rend="inline" n="63" unit="page"/> Mr.  B. thought
this the greatest of compliments, though it was meant  otherwise.  If losing
and obliterating the outline constitutes a  Picture, Mr. B. will never be
so foolish as to do one.  Such  art of losing the outlines is the art of Venice
and Flanders; it  loses all character, and leaves what some people call, 
expression: but this is a false notion of expression; expression  cannot exist
without character as its stamina; and neither  character nor expression can
exist without firm and determinate  outline.  Fresco Painting is susceptible
of higher finishing than  Drawing on Paper, or than any other method of Painting.
 But he  must have a strange organization of sight who does not prefer a 
Drawing on Paper to a Dawbing in Oil by the same master,  supposing both to
be done with equal care.</p><pb n="550"/><p>  The great and golden rule of art, as well as of life, is this: That the
more distinct, sharp, <milestone rend="inline" n="64" unit="page"/> and wirey
the bounding line, the more perfect the work of art; and the less keen and
sharp, the greater is the evidence of weak imitation, plagiarism, and bungling.
 Great inventors, in all ages, knew this: Protogenes and Apelles knew each
other by this line. Rafael and Michael Angelo, and Albert Durer, are known
by this and this alone.  The want of this determinate and bounding form evidences
the want of idea in the artist's mind, and the    <ptr target="tn550.1"/> pretence
of the plagiary in all its branches.  How do we  distinguish the oak from
the beech, the horse from the ox, but  by the bounding outline? How do we
distinguish one face or  countenance from another, but by the bounding line
and its  infinite inflexions and movements? What is it that builds a house
 and plants a garden, but the definite and determinate? What is it  that distinguishes
honesty from knavery, but the hard and wirey  line of rectitude and certainty <milestone rend="inline" n="65" unit="page"/> in the actions and  intentions.  Leave out
this l<supplied>[i]</supplied>ne and you leave out life itself;  all is chaos
again, and the line of the almighty must be drawn  out upon it before man
or beast can exist.  Talk no more then of  Correggio, or Rembrandt, or any
other of those plagiaries of  Venice or Flanders.  They were but the lame
imitators of lines  drawn by their predecessors, and their works prove themselves
 contemptible dis-arranged imitations and blundering misapplied  copies.</p></div4><div4 n="16" type="entry" id="b8.3.3.16"><head rend="center"> NUMBER XVI.</head><head rend="center"><hi rend="i">The Penance of Jane Shore in St. Paul's Church.--A

Painting and Designing, whose method, alone, can delineate Character as it
is in this Picture, where all the Lineaments are distinct.</p><p>It is hoped that the Painter will be allowed by the Public (notwithstanding
artfully dissemminated insinuations to the contrary) to be better able than
any other to keep his own Characters and Expressions; having had sufficient
evidence in the Works of our own Hogarth, that no other Artist can reach the
original Spirit so well as the Painter himself, especially as Mr. B. is an
old well-known and acknowledged Engraver.</p><p>     The size of the Engraving will be 3-feet 1-inch long, by 1-foot high.—The
Artist engages to deliver it, finished, in One Year from September next.—No
Work of Art, can take longer than a Year: it   <pb n="568"/>    may be worked
backwards and forwards without end, and last a Man's whole Life; but he will,
at length, only be forced to bring it back to what it was, and it will be
worse than it was at the end of the first Twelve Months.  The Value of this
Artist's Year is the Criterion of Society: and as it is valued, so does Society
flourish or decay. </p><p>The Price to Subscribers—Four Guineas, Two to be paid at the
time of Subscribing, the other Two, on delivery of the Print.</p><p>Subscriptions received at No. 28,  Corner of Broad-street, Golden
Square; where the Picture is now Exhibiting, among other Works, by the same
Artist.</p><p>The Price will be considerably raised to Non-subscribers.  May 15th,

attended by poverty and obscurity; this was never the fault of the Public,
but was owing to a neglect of means to propagate such works as have wholly
absorbed the Man of Genius.  Even Milton and Shakespeare could not publish
their own works.</p><p>This difficulty has been obviated by the Author of the following productions
now presented to the Public; who has invented a method of Printing both Letter-press
and Engraving in a style more ornamental, uniform, and grand, than any before
discovered, while it produces works at less than one fourth of the expense.</p><p>If a method of Printing which combines the Painter and the Poet is
a phenomenon worthy of public attention, provided that it exceeds in elegance
all former methods, the Author is sure of his reward.</p><p>Mr. Blake's powers of invention very early engaged the attention of
many persons of eminence and fortune; by whose means he has been regularly
enabled to bring before the Public works (he is not afraid to say) of equal
magnitude and consequence with the productions of any age or country: among
which are two large highly finished engravings (and two more are nearly ready)
which will commence a Series of subjects from the Bible, and another from
the History of England.</p><p>The following are the Subjects of the several Works now published

hand which executed these little ideas been that of a plagiary, who works
only from the memory, we should have seen blots, called masses; blots without
form, and therefore without meaning.  These blots of light and dark, as being
the result of labour, are always clumsy and indefinite; the effect of rubbing
out and putting in, like the progress of a blind man, or of one in the dark,
who feels his way, but does not see it.  These are not so.  Even the copy
from Raphael's Cartoon of St. Paul preaching, is a firm, determinate outline,
struck at once, as Protogenes struck his line, when he meant to make himself
known to Apelles.  The map of Allestone has the same character of the firm
and determinate.  All his efforts prove this little boy to have had that greatest
of all blessings, a strong imagination, a clear idea, and a determinate vision
of things in his own mind.</p></div2><div2 n="3" type="section" id="b14.3"><pb n="694"/><head rend="center">[Memoranda from the Notebook]</head><milestone rend="left" n="4" unit="page"/><lg><head type="incipits">"I say I shant live five years"</head><l>I say I shant live five years</l><l>And if I live one it will be a</l><l>Wonder    June 1793</l></lg><lg><head type="incipits">"Tuesday . . ."</head><l>     Tuesday  Jan<hi rend="sup">ry</hi>. 20. 1807 between Two &amp; Seven

Especially if I should have to answer for it I feel very sorry that your Ideas
&amp; Mine on Moral Painting differ so much as to have made you angry with
my method of Study.  If I am wrong I am wrong in good company.  I had hoped
your plan comprehended All Species of this Art &amp; Especially that you would
not reject that Species which gives Existence to Every other. namely Visions
of Eternity You say that I want somebody to Elucidate my Ideas.  But you ought
to know that What is Grand is necessarily obscure to Weak men.  That which
can be made Explicit to the Idiot is not worth my care.  The wisest of the
Ancients considerd what is not too Explicit as the fittest for Instruction
because it rouzes the faculties to act.  I name Moses Solomon Esop Homer Plato</p><p>But as you have favord me with your remarks on my Design permit me
in return to defend it against a mistaken one, which is.  That I have supposed
Malevolence without a Cause.--Is not Merit in one a Cause of Envy in another
&amp; Serenity &amp; Happiness &amp; Beauty a Cause of Malevolence.  But Want
of Money &amp; the Distress of A Thief can never be alledged as the Cause
of his Thievery. for many honest people endure greater hard ships with Fortitude
We must therefore seek the Cause elsewhere than in want of Money for that
is the Misers passion, not the Thiefs</p><p>     I have therefore proved your Reasonings Ill proportiond which you
can never prove my figures to be.  They are those of Michael Angelo Rafael
&amp; the Antique &amp; of the best living Models. I percieve that your Eye<del>
[<hi rend="i">s</hi>]</del> is perverted by Caricature Prints, which ought
not to abound so much as they do.  Fun I love but too much Fun is of all things
the most loathsom.  Mirth is better than Fun &amp; Happiness is better than
Mirth--I feel that a Man may be happy in This World.  And I know that This
World Is a World of Imagination &amp; Vision I see Every thing I paint In
This World, but Every body does not see alike.  To the Eyes of a Miser a Guinea
is more beautiful than the Sun &amp; a bag worn with the use of Money has
more beautiful proportions than a Vine filled with Grapes. The tree which
moves some to tears of joy is in the Eyes of others only a Green thing that
stands in the way.  Some See Nature all Ridicule &amp; Deformity &amp; by
these I shall not regulate my proportions, &amp; Some Scarce see Nature at
all But to the Eyes of the Man of Imagination Nature is Imagination itself.
 As a man is So he Sees.  As the Eye is formed such are its Powers You certainly
Mistake when you say that the Visions of Fancy are not be found in This World.
 To Me This World is all One continued Vision of Fancy or Imagination &amp;
I feel Flatterd when I am told So.  What is it sets Homer Virgil &amp; Milton
in so high a rank of Art.  Why is the Bible more<pb n="703"/> Entertaining&amp;
Instructive than any other book.  Is it not because they are addressed to
the Imagination which is Spiritual Sensation &amp; but mediately to the Understanding
or Reason Such is True Painting and such <add>&lt;was&gt;</add> alone valued
by the Greeks &amp; the best modern Artists.  Consider what Lord Bacon says
“:Sense sends over to Imagination before Reason have judged &amp; Reason
sends over to Imagination before the Decree can be acted.” See Advancemt
of Learning Part 2 P 47 of first Edition</p><p>But I am happy to find a Great Majority of Fellow Mortals who can
Elucidate My Visions &amp; Particularly they have been Elucidated by Children
who have taken a greater delight in contemplating my Pictures than I even
hoped.  Neither Youth nor Childhood is Folly or Incapacity Some Children are
Fools &amp; so are some Old Men.  But There is a vast Majority on the side
of Imagination or Spiritual Sensation</p><p>To Engrave after another Painter is infinitely more laborious than
to Engrave ones own Inventions.  And of the Size you require my price has
been Thirty Guineas &amp; I cannot afford to do it for less.  I had Twelve
for the Head I sent you as a Specimen, but after my own designs I could do
at least Six times the quantity of labour in the same time which will account
for the difference of price as also that Chalk Engraving is at least six times
as laborious as Aqua tinta.  I have no objection to Engraving after another
Artist.  Engraving is the profession I was apprenticed to, &amp; should never
have attempted to live by any thing else If orders had not come in for my
Designs &amp; Paintings, which I have the pleasure to tell you are Increasing
Every Day. Thus If I am a Painter it is not to be attributed to Seeking after.
 But I am contented whether I live by Painting or Engraving</p><closer><salute rend="left">     I am Rev<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Sir Your very

pleases my employer &amp; I have an order for Fifty small Pictures at One
Guinea each which is Something better than mere copying after another artist.
 But above all I feel myself happy &amp; contented let what will come having

the lowest order of luxuries should have become a City of Elegance in some
degree &amp; that its once stupid inhabitants should enter into an Emulation
of Grecian manners.  There are now I believe as many Booksellers as there
are Butchers &amp; as many Printshops as of any other trade We remember when
a Print shop was a rare bird in London &amp; I myself remember when I thought
my pursuits of Art a kind of Criminal Dissipation &amp; neglect of the main
chance which I hid my face for not being able to abandon as a Passion which
is forbidden by Law &amp; Religion, but now<pb n="707"/> it appears to be Law&amp;
Gospel too, at least I hear so from the few friends I have dared to visit
in my stupid Melancholy. Excuse this communication of sentiments which I felt
necessary to my repose at this time.  I feel very strongly that I neglect

Little Tom</hi> has been of late unattended to, and my wife's  illness not
being quite gone off, she has not printed any more  since you went to London.
 But we can muster a few in colours and  some in black which I hope will be
no less favour'd tho' they are  rough like rough sailors.  We mean to begin
printing again  to-morrow.  Time flies very fast and very merrily.  I sometimes
 try to be miserable that I may do more work, but find it is a  foolish experiment.
 Happinesses have wings and wheels; miseries  are leaden legged and their
whole employment is to clip the wings  and to take off the wheels of our chariots.
 We determine,  therefore, to be happy and do all that we can, tho' not all
that  we would.  Our dear friend Flaxman is the theme of my emulation  in
this industry, as well as in other virtues and merits.  Gladly  I hear of
his full health and spirits.  Happy son of the Immortal  Phidias, his lot
is truly glorious, and mine no less happy in his  friendship and in that of
his friends.  Our cottage is surrounded  by the same guardians you left with
us; they keep off every wind.  We hear the west howl at a distance, the south
bounds on high  over our thatch, and smiling on our cottage says: “You
lay too  low for my anger to injure.” As to the east and north I believe
 they cannot get past the turret.    </p><pb n="715"/><p>My wife joins me in duty and affection to you.  Please to remember us

so too because there appears some reason why you might be so.  But when you
have heard me out you will not be so</p><p>     I have now given two years to the intense study of those parts of
the art which relate to light &amp; shade &amp; colour &amp; am Convincd that
either my understanding is incapable of comprehending the beauties of Colouring
or the Pictures which I painted for You Are Equal in Every part of the Art
&amp; superior in One to any thing that has been done since the age of Rafael.—<add>&lt;All&gt;</add> Sr J Reynolds's discourses <add>&lt;to the Royal Academy&gt;</add>
will shew. that the Venetian finesse in Art can never be united with the Majesty
of Colouring necessary to Historical beauty. &amp; in a letter to the Rev<hi rend="sup">d</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Gilpin author of a work on Picturesque
Scenery he says Thus “It may be worth consideration whether the epithet
Picturesque is not applicable to the excellencies of the inferior Schools
rather than to the higher. The works of Michael Angelo Rafael &amp;c appear
to me to have nothing of it: whereas Rubens &amp; the Venetian Painters may
almost be said to have Nothing Else.—Perhaps Picturesque is somewhat
synonymous to the word Taste which we should think improperly applied to Homer
or Milton but very well to Prior or Pope.  I suspect that the application
of these words are to Excellencies of an inferior order &amp; which are incompatible
with the Grand Style You are certainly right in saying that Variety of Tints
&amp; Forms is Picturesque: but it must be rememberd on the other hand.<pb n="719"/> that the reverse of this—(<hi rend="i">uniformity of Colour
&amp; a long continuation of lines</hi>) produces Grandeur”———So
Says Sir Joshua and So say I for I have now proved that the parts of the art
which I neglected to display in those little pictures &amp; drawings which
I had the pleasure &amp; profit to do for you are incompatible with the designs—There
is nothing in the Art which our Painters do. that I can confess myself ignorant
of I also Know &amp; Understand &amp; can assuredly affirm that the works
I have done for You are Equal to Carrache or Rafael (and I am now Seven years
older than Rafael was when he died) I say they are Equal to Carrache or Rafael
or Else I am Blind Stupid Ignorant and Incapable in two years Study to understand
those things which a Boarding School Miss can comprehend in a fortnight. 
Be assured My dear Friend that there is not one touch in those Drawings &amp;
Pictures but what came from my Head &amp; my Heart in Unison.  That I am Proud
of being their Author and Grateful to you my Employer. &amp; that I look upon
you as the Chief of my Friends whom I would endeavour to please because you
among all men have enabled me to produce these things.  I would not send you
a Drawing or a Picture till I had again reconsiderd my notions of Art &amp;
had put myself back as if I was a learner I have proved that I am Right &amp;
shall now Go on with the Vigor I was in my Childhood famous for</p><p>But I do not pretend to be Perfect. but if my Works have faults Caracche
Corregios &amp; Rafaels have faults also. let me observe that the yellow leather
flesh of old men the ill drawn &amp; ugly young women &amp; above all the
dawbed black &amp; yellow shadows that are found in most fine ay &amp; the
finest pictures.  I altogether reject as ruinous to Effect tho Connoisseurs
may think otherwise.</p><p>Let me also notice that Carraches Pictures are not like Correggios
nor Correggios like Rafaels &amp; if neither of them was to be encouraged
till he did like any of the others be must die without Encouragement My Pictures
are unlike any of these Painters &amp; I would have them to be so I think
the manner I adopt More Perfect than any other no doubt They thought the same
of theirs</p><p>You will be tempted to think that As I improve The Pictures &amp;c
that I did for you are not what I would now wish them to be.  On this I beg
to say That they are What I intended them &amp; that I know I never shall
do better for if I was to do them over again they would lose as much as they
gaind because they were done in the heat of My Spirits</p><p>     But You will justly enquire why I have not written All this time to

you about it or any of my real Friends (I have written many letters to you

as I hope they are now in private. for till then.  I leave no stone unturnd
&amp; no path unexplord that tends to improvement in my beloved Arts.  One
thing of real consequence I have accomplishd by coming into the country. which
is to me consolation enough, namely.  I have recollected all my scatterd thoughts
on Art &amp; resumed my primitive &amp; original ways of Execution in both
painting &amp; Engraving. which in the confusion of London I had very much
lost &amp; obliterated from my mind.  But whatever becomes of my labours I
would rather that they should be preservd in your Green House (not as you
mistakenly call it dung hill). than in the cold gallery of fashion.—The
Sun may yet shine &amp; then they will be brought into open air.</p><p>    But you have so generously &amp; openly desired that I will divide
my griefs with you that I cannot hide what it is now become my duty to explain—My
unhappiness has arisen from a source which if explord too narrowly might hurt
my pecuniary circumstances.  As my dependence is on Engraving at present &amp;
particularly on the Engravings I have in hand for M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> H.
&amp; I find on all hands great objections to my doing any thing but the meer
drudgery of business &amp; intimations that if I do not confine myself to
this I shall not live. this has always pursud me.  You will understand by
this the source of all my uneasiness This from Johnson &amp; Fuseli brought
me down here &amp; this from M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> H will bring me back again
for that I cannot live without doing my duty to lay up treasures in heaven
is Certain &amp; Determined &amp; to this I have long made up my mind &amp;
why this should be made an objection to Me while Drunkenness Lewdness Gluttony
&amp; even Idleness itself does not hurt other men let Satan himself Explain—The
Thing I have most at Heart! more than life or all that seems to make life
comfortable without.  Is the Interest of True Religion &amp; Science &amp;
whenever any thing appears to affect that Interest. (Especially if I myself
omit any duty to my <del>[<hi rend="i">self</hi>]</del><add>&lt;Station&gt;</add> as a Soldier of Christ) It gives me the greatest of torments, I am
not ashamed afraid or averse to tell You what Ought to be Told.  That I am

slide in clay how can we do otherwise than fear &amp; tremble. but I should
not have troubled You with this account of my spiritual state unless it had
been necessary in explaining the actual cause of my uneasiness into which
you are so kind as to Enquire for I never obtrude such things on others unless
questiond &amp; then I never disguise the truth—But if we fear to do
the dictates of our Angels &amp; tremble at the Tasks set before us. if we
refuse to do Spiritual Acts. because of Natural Fears or Natural Desires!

Ague surprized me because I have no Ague but have had a Cold this Winter.
 You know that it is my way to make the best of every thing.  I never make
myself nor my friends uneasy if I can help it.  My Wife has bad Agues &amp;
Rheumatisms almost ever since she has been here, but our time is almost out
that we took the Cottage for.  I did not mention our Sickness to you &amp;
should not to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Butts but for a determination which we
have lately made namely To leave This Place—because I am now certain
of what I have long doubted Viz <del>[<hi rend="i">that H</hi>]</del> is jealous
as Stothard was &amp; will be no further My friend than he is compelld by
circumstances.  The truth is As a Poet he is frightend at me &amp; as a Painter
his views &amp; mine are opposite he thinks to turn me into a Portrait Painter
as he did Poor Romney, but this he nor all the devils in hell will never do.
 I must own that seeing H. like S Envious (&amp; that he is I am now certain)
made me very uneasy, but it is over &amp; I now defy the worst &amp; fear
not while I am true to myself which I will be.  This is the uneasiness I spoke
of to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Butts but<pb n="726"/> I did not tell him so plain&amp;
wish you to keep it a secret &amp; to burn this letter because it speaks so
plain I told M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Butts that I did not wish to Explore too
much the cause of our determination to leave Felpham because of pecuniary
connexions between H &amp; me—Be not then uneasy on any account &amp;
tell my Sister not to be uneasy for I am fully Employd &amp; Well Paid I have
made it so much H's interest to employ me that he can no longer treat me with
indifference &amp; now it is in my power to stay or return or remove to any
other place that I choose, because I am getting before hand in money matters
The Profits arising from Publications are immense &amp; I now have it in my
power to commence publication with many very formidable works, which I have
finishd &amp; ready A Book price half a guinea may be got out at the Expense
of Ten pounds &amp; its almost certain profits are 500 G.  I am only sorry
that I did not know the methods of publishing years ago &amp; this is one
of the numerous benefits I have obtaind by coming here for I should never
have known the nature of Publication unless I had known H &amp; his connexions
&amp; his method of managing.  It now <add>&lt;would&gt;</add> be folly not to
venture publishing.  I am now Engraving Six little plates for a little work
of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> H's for which I am to have 10 G<add>&lt;uineas&gt;</add> each &amp; the certain profits of that work are a fortune such as would
make me independent supposing that I could substantiate such a one of my own
&amp; I mean to try many But I again say as I said before We are very Happy

&amp; the sea roaring at a distance but if sickness comes all is unpleasant

every assistance in his power <add>&lt;without knowing my intention&gt;</add>.
But since I wrote yours we had made the resolution of which we informd him
viz to leave Felpham entirely.  I also told you what I was about &amp; that
I was not ignorant of what was doing in London in works of art.  But I did

when I wrote to him the last time) &amp; was not then perswaded as I am now
that the air tho warm is unhealthy</p><p>     However this I know will set you at Ease.  I am now so full of work
that I have had no time to go on with the Ballads, &amp; my prospects of more

afraid of losing me &amp; also very afraid that my Friends in London should
have a bad opinion of the reception he has given to me But My Wife has undertaken
to Print the whole number of the Plates for Cowpers work which she does to
admiration &amp; being under my own<pb n="727"/> eye the prints are as fine
as the French prints &amp; please every one. in short I have Got every thing
so under my thumb that it is more profitable that things should be as they
are than any other way, tho not so agreeable because we wish naturally for
friendship in preference to interest.—The Publishers are already indebted
to My Wife Twenty Guineas for work deliverd this is a small specimen of how
we go on. then fear nothing &amp; let my Sister fear nothing because it appears
to me that I am now too old &amp; have had too much experience to be any longer
imposed upon only illness makes all uncomfortable &amp; this we must prevent
by every means in our power</p><p>     I send with this 5 Copies of N4 of the Ballads for M<hi rend="sup">
rs</hi> Flaxman &amp; Five more two of which you will be so good as to give
to M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Chetwynd if she should call or send for them. 
These Ballads are likely to be Profitable for we have Sold all that we have
had time to print.  Evans the Bookseller in Pallmall says they go off very
well &amp; why should we repent of having done them it is doing Nothing that
is to be repented of &amp; not doing such things as these</p><p>     Pray remember us both to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hall when you see

various projected works &amp; particularly. a work now Proposed to the Public
at the End of Cowpers Life. which will very likely be of great consequence
it is Cowpers Milton the same that Fuselis Milton Gallery was painted for,,
&amp; if we succeed in our intentions the prints to this work will be very
profitable to me &amp; not only profitable but honourable at any rate The
Project pleases Lord Cowpers family. &amp; I am now labouring in my thoughts
Designs for this &amp; other works equally creditable These are works to be
boasted of &amp; therefore I cannot feel depress'd tho I know that as far
as Designing &amp; Poetry are concernd I am Envied in many Quarters. but I
will cram the Dogs for I know that the Public are my friends &amp; love my

of this work I take care to say little to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> H. since
he is as much averse to my poetry as he is to a Chapter in the Bible   He
knows that I have writ it for I have shewn it to him &amp; he had read Part
by his own desire &amp; has lookd with sufficient contempt to enhance my opinion
of it.  But I do not wish to irritate by seeming too obstinate in Poetic pursuits

follows upon this ticklish subject.  I regard Fashion in Poetry as little
as I do in Painting. so if both Poets &amp; Painters should alternately dislike
(but I know the majority of them will not) I am not to regard it at all but
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> H approves of My Designs as little as he does of my

pursuit of both Arts.  Indeed by my late Firmness I have brought down his
affected Loftiness &amp; he begins to think I have some Genius. as if Genius

Me only deserve laughter—I say thus much to you knowing that you will
not make a bad use of it   But it is a Fact too true That if I had only depended
on Mortal Things both myself &amp; my Wife must have been Lost—I shall
leave every one in This Country astonishd at my Patience &amp; Forbearance

Execute for you but shall not be able to send any more before my return tho
perhaps I may bring some with me finishd.  I am at Present in a Bustle to
defend myself against a very unwarrantable warrant from a justice of Peace
in Chichester. which was taken out against me by a Private in Capt<hi rend="sup">
n</hi> Leathes's troop of 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> or Royal Dragoons for an
assault &amp; Seditious words.  The wretched Man has terribly Perjurd himself
as has his CoM<hi rend="sup">r</hi>ade for as to Sedition not one Word relating
to the King or Government was spoken by either him or me.  His Enmity arises
from my having turned him out of my Garden into which he was invited as an
assistant by a Gardener at work therein, without my knowledge that he was
so invited.  I desired him as politely as was possible to go out of the Garden,
he made me an impertinent answer I insisted on his leaving the Garden he refused
I still persisted in desiring his departure he then threatend to knock out
my Eyes with many abominable imprecations &amp; with some contempt for my
Person it affronted my foolish Pride I therefore took him by the Elbows &amp;
pushed him before me till I had got him out. there I intended to have left
him. but he turning about put himself into a Posture of Defiance threatening
&amp; swearing at me.  I perhaps foolishly &amp; perhaps not, stepped out
at the Gate &amp; putting aside his blows took him again by the Elbows &amp;
keeping his back to me pushed him forwards down the road about fifty yards
he all the while endeavouring to turn round &amp; strike me &amp; raging &amp;
cursing which drew out several neighbours. at length when I had got him to
where he was Quarterd. which was very quickly done. we were met at the Gate
by the Master of the house.  The Fox Inn, (who is <del>[<hi rend="i">my</hi>]
</del> the proprietor of my Cottage) &amp; his wife &amp; Daughter. &amp;
the Mans CoM<hi rend="sup">r</hi>ade. &amp; several other people My Landlord
compelld the Soldiers to go in doors after many abusive threats <del>[<hi rend="i">from the</hi>]</del> against me &amp; my wife from the two Soldiers
but not one word of threat on account of Sedition was utterd at that time.
 This method of Revenge was Plann'd between them after they had got together
into the Stable.  This is the whole outline.  I have for witnesses. The Gardener
who is Hostler at the Fox &amp; who Evidences that to his knowledge no word
of the remotest tendency to Government or Sedition was utterd,—Our next
door Neighbour a Millers wife who saw me turn him before me down the road
&amp; saw &amp; heard all that happend at the Gate of the Inn who Evidences
that no Expression of threatening on account of Sedition was utterd in the
heat of their fury by either of the Dragoons. this was the womans own remark
&amp; does high honour to her good sense as she observes that whenever a quarrel
happens the offence is always repeated.  The Landlord of the Inn &amp; His
Wife &amp; daughter will Evidence the Same &amp; will evidently prove the
Comrade perjurd who swore that he heard me <add>&lt;while&gt;</add> at the Gate
utter Seditious words &amp; D—- the K—- without which perjury
I could not have been committed &amp; I had no witness with me before the
Justices who could combat his assertion as the Gardener remaind in my Garden
all the while &amp; he was the only person I thought necessary to take with
me.  I have been before a Bench of Justices at Chichester this morning. but
they as the Lawyer who<pb n="733"/> wrote down the Accusation told me in private
are compelld by the Military to suffer a prosecution to be enterd into altho
they must know &amp; it is manifest that the whole is a Fabricated Perjury.
 I have been forced to find Bail.  M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hayley was kind
enough to come forwards &amp; M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Seagrave Printer at Chichester.

Sessions which is after Michaelmass. So I shall have the Satisfaction to see
my friends in Town before this Contemptible business comes on I say Contemptible
for it must be manifest to every one that the whole accusation is a wilful
Perjury.  Thus you see my dear Friend that I cannot leave this place without
some adventure. it has struck a consternation thro all the Villages round.
 Every Man is now afraid of speaking to or looking at a Soldier. for the peaceable
Villagers have always been forward in expressing their kindness for us &amp;
they express their sorrow at our departure as soon as they hear of it Every
one here is my Evidence for Peace &amp; Good Neighbourhood &amp; yet such
is the present state of things this foolish accusation must be tried in Public.
 Well I am content I murmur not &amp; doubt not that I shall recieve Justice
&amp; am only sorry for the trouble &amp; expense.  I have heard that my Accuser
is a disgraced Sergeant his name is John Scholfield. perhaps it will be in

origin of all offences committed against me.  If I have found this I shall
have learned a most valuable thing well worth three years perseverance.  I

spoken.—</p><p>     M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. Haynes Evidences, that she saw me turn him
down the Road, &amp; all the while we were at the Stable Door, and that not
one word of charge against me was uttered, either relating to Sedition or
any thing else; all he did was swearing and threatening.—</p><p>     M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Hosier heard him say that he would be revenged,
and would have me hanged if he could!  He spoke this the Day after my turning
him out of the Garden.  Hosier says he is ready to give Evidence of this,
if necessary.—</p><p>The Soldier's Comrade swore before the Magistrates, while I was present,
that he heard me utter seditious words, at the Stable Door, and in particular,
said, that he heard me D—n the K—g.  Now I have all the Persons

Subjects was uttered, either by one party or the other, and they are ready,
on their Oaths, to say that I did not utter such Words.—</p><p>     M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. Haynes says very sensibly, that she never
heard People quarrel, but they always charged each other with the Offence,
and repeated it to those around, therefore as the Soldier charged not me with
Seditious Words at that Time, neither did his Comrade, the whole Charge must
have been fabricated in the Stable afterwards.—</p><p>     If we prove the Comrade perjured who swore that he heard me D—n
the K—g, I believe the whole Charge falls to the Ground.      M<hi rend="sup">
r</hi>. Cosens, owner of the Mill at Felpham, was passing by in the Road,
and saw me and the Soldier and William standing near each other; he heard
nothing, but says we certainly were not quarrelling.—</p><p>The whole Distance that William could be at any Time of the Conversation
between me and the Soldier (supposing such Conversation to have existed) is
only 12 Yards, &amp; W— says that he was backwards and forwards in the
Garden.  It was a still Day, there was no Wind stirring.</p><pb n="735"/><p>William says on his Oath, that the first Words that he heard me speak
to the Soldier were ordering him out of the Garden; the truth is, I did not
speak to the Soldier till then, &amp; my ordering him out of the Garden was
occasioned by his [P 2] saying something that I thought insulting.</p><p>The Time that I &amp; the Soldier were together in the Garden, was
not sufficient for me to have uttered the Things that he alledged.</p><p>The Soldier said to Mrs. Grinder, that it would be right to have my
House searched, as I might have plans of the Country which I intended to send
to the Enemy; he called me a Military Painter; I suppose mistaking the Words
Miniature Painter, which he might have heard me called.  I think that this
proves, his having come into the Garden, with some bad Intention, or at least
with a prejudiced Mind.</p><p>It is necessary to learn the Names of all that were present at the
Stable Door, that we may not have any Witnesses brought against us, that were
not there.</p><p>All the Persons present at the Stable Door were, Mrs. Grinder and
her Daughter, all the Time; Mrs. Haynes &amp; her Daughter all the Time; Mr.
Grinder, part of the Time; Mr. Hayley's Gardener part of the Time.—
Mrs. Haynes was present from my turning him out at my Gate, all the rest of
the Time—What passed in the Garden, there is no Person but William &amp;
the Soldier, &amp; myself can know.</p><p>There was not any body in Grinder's Tap-room, but an Old Man, named
Jones, who (Mrs. Grinder says) did not come out—He is the same Man who
lately hurt his Hand, &amp; wears it in a sling—</p><p>     The Soldier after he and his Comrade came together into the Tap-room,
threatened to knock William's Eyes out (this was his often repeated Threat
to me and to my Wife) because W— refused to go with him to Chichester,

I have been
with Mr. Saunders who has now in his possession all Mr. Romney's pictures
that remained after the sale at Hempstead; I saw <hi rend="i">Milton and his
Daughters</hi>, and <hi rend="i">'Twas where the Seas were Roaring</hi>, and
a beautiful <hi rend="i">Female head</hi>.  He has promised to write a list
of all that he has in his possession, and of all that he remembers of Mr.
Romney's paintings, with notices where they now are, as far as his recollection
will serve.  The picture of <hi rend="i">Christ in the Desert</hi> he supposes
to be one of those which he has rolled on large rollers.  He will take them
down and unroll them, but cannot do it easily, as they are so large as to
occupy the whole length of his workshop, and are laid across beams at the
top.</p><pb n="738"/><p>Mr Flaxman is now out of town.  When he returns I will lose no time
in setting him to work on the same object.</p><p>     I have got to work after Fuseli for a little Shakespeare. Mr. Johnson
the bookseller tells me that there is no want of work.  So far you will be
rejoiced with me, and your words, <hi rend="i">“Do not fear you can
want employment!”</hi> were verified the morning after I received your
kind letter; but I go on finishing Romney with spirit, and for the relief
of variety shall engage in other little works as they arise.</p><p>I called on Mr. Evans who gives small hopes of our ballads; he says
he has sold but fifteen numbers at the most, and that going on would be a
certain loss of almost all the expenses.  I then proposed to him to take a
part with me in publishing them on a smaller scale, which he declined on account
of its being out of his line of business to publish, and a line in which he
is determined never to engage, attaching himself wholly to the sale of fine
editions of authors and curious books in general.  He advises that some publisher
should be spoken to who would purchase the copyright: and, as far as I can
judge of the nature of publication, no chance is left to one out of the trade.
 Thus the case stands at present.  God send better times.  Everybody complains,
yet all go on cheerfully and with spirit.  The shops in London improve; everything
is elegant, clean, and neat; the streets are widened where they were narrow;
even Snow Hill is become almost level, and is a very handsome street, and
the narrow part of the Strand near St. Clement's is widened and become very
elegant.</p><p>My wife continues poorly, but fancies she is better in health here

hand &amp; a torch in the other, both held above her head &amp; a figure kneeling
at her feet. it is a very sublime drawing &amp; would make an Excellent Print

prints to it by Fittler.  Whether you intended it or not, they have given
me some excellent hints in engraving; his manner of working is what I shall
endeavour to adopt in many points.  I have seen the elder M<hi rend="sup">
r</hi>. Walker.  He knew and admired without any preface my print of Romney,
and when his daughter came in he gave the print into her hand without a word,
and she immediately said, “Ah!  Romney! younger than I have known him, <hi rend="i">but very like indeed.</hi>” M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Walker
showed me Romney's first attempt at oil painting; it is a copy from a Dutch
picture—Dutch boor smoking; on the back is written, “This was
the first attempt at oil painting by G. Romney.” He shew'd me also the
last performance of Romney.  It is of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Walker and family,
the draperies put in by somebody else.  It is a very excellent picture, but
unfinished.  The figures as large as life, half length, Mr. W., three sons,
and, I believe, two daughters, with maps, instruments, &amp;<hi rend="sup">
c</hi>.  Mr.  Walker also shew'd me a portrait of himself (W.), whole length,
on a canvas about two feet by one and a half; it is the first portrait Romney
ever painted.  But above all, a picture of <hi rend="i">Lear and Cordelia
</hi>, when he awakes and knows her,—an incomparable production, which
Mr. W. bought for five shillings at a broker's shop; it is about five feet
by four, and exquisite for expression; indeed, it is most pathetic; the heads
of Lear and Cordelia can never be surpassed, and Kent and the other attendant
are admirable; the picture is very highly finished.  Other things I saw of
Romney's first works: two copies, perhaps from Borgognone, of battles; and
Mr. Walker promises to collect all he can of information for you.  I much
admired his mild and gentle benevolent manners; it seems as if all Romney's
intimate friends were truly amiable and feeling like himself.</p><p>     I have also seen Alderman Boydel, who has promised to get the number
and prices of all Romney's prints as you desired.  He has sent a Catalogue
of all his Collection, and a Scheme of his Lottery; desires his compliments
to you; says he laments your absence from London, as your advice would be
acceptable at all times, but especially at the present.  He is very thin and<pb n="749"/> decay'd, and but the shadow of what he was; so he is now a Shadow's
Shadow; but how can we expect a very stout man at eighty-five, which age he
tells me he has now reached?  You would have been pleas'd to see his eyes
light up at the mention of your name.</p><p>     Mr. Flaxman agrees with me that somewhat more than outline is necessary
to the execution of Romney's designs, because his merit is eminent in the
art of massing his lights and shades.  I should propose to etch them in a
rapid but firm manner, somewhat, perhaps, as I did the <hi rend="i">Head of
Euler</hi>; the price I receive for engraving Flaxman's outlines of <hi rend="i">
Homer</hi> is five guineas each.  I send the Domenichino, which is very neatly
done.  His merit was but little in light and shade; outline was his element,
and yet these outlines give but a faint idea of the finished prints from his
works, several of the best of which I have.  I send also the French monuments,
and inclose with them a catalogue of Bell's Gallery, and another of the Exhibition,
which I have <hi rend="i">not</hi> yet seen.  I mentioned the pictures from
Sterne to Mr. Walker; he says that there were several; one, a garden scene,
with Uncle Toby and Obadiah planting in the garden; but that of Lefevre's
Death he speaks of as incomparable, but cannot tell where it now is, as they
were scattered abroad, being disposed of by means of a raffle.  He supposes
it is in Westmoreland; promises to make every inquiry about it.  Accept, also,
of my thanks for Cowper's third volume, which I got, as you directed, of Mr.
 Johnson.  I have seen Mr. Rose; he looks, tho' not so well as I have seen
him, yet tolerably, considering the terrible storm he has been thro'! He says
that the last session was a severe labour; indeed it must be so to a man just
out of so dreadful a fever.  I also thank you for your very beautiful little
poem on the King's recovery; it is one of the prettiest things I ever read,
and I hope the King will live to fulfil the prophecy and die in peace; but
at present, poor man, I understand he is poorly indeed, and times threaten
worse than ever.  I must now express my sorrow and my hopes for our good Miss
Poole, and so take my leave for the present, with the joint love of my good
woman, who is still stiff-knee'd but well in other respects.</p><closer><salute rend="right">I am, dear Sir,<lb/>Yours most sincerely,</salute><signed rend="right">WILLIAM BLAKE</signed><signed rend="left"><supplied>[From the

I have
read the book thro' attentively and was much entertain'd and instructed, but
have not yet come to the <hi rend="i">Life of Washington</hi>.  I suppose
an American would tell me that Washington did all that was done before he
was born, as the French now<pb n="750"/> adore Buonaparte and the English our
poor George; so the Americans will consider Washington as their god.  This
is only Grecian, or rather Trojan, worship, and perhaps will be revised <supplied>[reversed?]</supplied> in an age or two.  In the meantime I have the happiness
of seeing the Divine countenance in such men as Cowper and Milton more distinctly
than in any prince or hero.  Mr. Phillips has sent a small poem; he would
not tell the author's name, but desired me to inclose it for you with Washington's <hi rend="i">Life</hi>.</p><p>     Mr. Carr called on me, and I, as you desired, gave him a history of
the reviewing business as far as I am acquainted with it.  He desires me to
express to you that he would heartily devote himself to the business in all
its laborious parts, if you would take on you the direction; and he thinks
it might be done with very little trouble to you.  He is now going to Russia;
hopes that the negotiations for this business is not wholly at an end, but
that on his return he may still perform his best, as your assistant in it.
 I have delivered the letter to Mr. Edwards, who will give it immediately
to Lady Hamilton. Mr. Walker I have again seen; he promises to collect numerous
particulars concerning Romney and send them to you; wonders he has not had
a line from you; desires me to assure you of his wish to give every information
in his power.  Says that I shall have <hi rend="i">Lear and Cordelia</hi>
to copy if you desire it should be done; supposes that Romney was about eighteen
when he painted it; it is therefore doubly interesting.  Mr. Walker is truly
an amiable man; spoke of Mr. Green as the oldest friend of Romney, who knew
most concerning him of any one; lamented the little difference that subsisted
between you, speaking of you both with great affection.  Mr. Flaxman has also
promised to write all he knows or can collect concerning Romney, and send
to you.  Mr. Sanders has promised to write to Mr. J. Romney immediately, desiring
him to give us liberty to copy any of his father's designs that Mr. Flaxman
may select for that purpose; doubts not at all of Mr. Romney's readiness to
send any of the cartoons to London you desire; if this can be done it will
be all that could be wished. I spoke to Mr. Flaxman about choosing out proper
subjects for our purpose; he has promised to do so.  I hope soon to send you
Flaxman's advice upon this article.  When I repeated to Mr. Phillips your
intention of taking the books you want from his shop, he made a reply to the
following purpose: “I shall be very proud to have Mr. Hayley's name
in my books, but please to express to him my hope that he will consider me
as the sincere friend of Mr. Johnson, who is (I have every reason to say)
both the most generous and honest man I ever knew, and with whose interest
I should be so averse to interfere, that I should wish him to have the refusal
first of anything before it should be offered to me, as I know the value of
Mr. Hayley's connexion too well to interfere between my best friend and him.”
 This Phillips spoke with real affection, and I know you will love him for
it, and will also respect Johnson the more for such testimony; but to balance
all this I must, in duty to my friend Seagrave, tell you that Mr. Rose repeated
to me his great opinion of Mr. Johnson's integrity, while we were talking
concerning Seagrave's printing; it is but justice, therefore, to tell you
that I perceive a determination in the London booksellers to injure Seagrave
in your opinion, if possible.<pb n="751"/> Johnson may be very honest and very
generous, too, where his own interest is concerned; but I must say that he
leaves no stone unturn'd to serve that interest, and often (I think) unfairly;
he always has taken care, when I have seen him, to rail against Seagrave,
and I perceive that he does the same by Mr. Rose.  Mr Phillips took care to
repeat Johnson's railing to me, and to say that country printers could not
do anything of consequence. Luckily he found fault with the paper which Cowper's <hi rend="i">Life</hi> is printed on, not knowing that it was furnish'd by Johnson.
 I let him run on so far as to say that it was scandalous and unfit forsuch
a work; here I cut him short by asking if he knew who furnish'd the paper.
 He answered: “I hope Mr. J. did not.” I assured him that he did,
and here he left off, desiring me to tell you that the <hi rend="i">Life of
Washington</hi> was not put to press till the 3rd of this month (May), and
on the 13th he had deliver'd a dozen copies at Stationer's Hall, and by the
16th five hundred were out.  This is swift work if literally true, but I am
not apt to believe literally what booksellers say; and on comparing <hi rend="i">
Cowper</hi> with <hi rend="i">Washington</hi>, must assert that, <hi rend="i">
except paper</hi> (which is Johnson's fault), <hi rend="i">Cowper</hi> is
far the best, both as to type and printing. Pray look at <hi rend="i">Washington
</hi> as far as page 177, you will find that the type is smaller than from
177 to 308, the whole middle of the book being printed with a larger and better
type than the two extremities; also it is carefully hot-pressed.  I say thus
much, being urged thereto by Mr. Rose's observing some defects in Seagrave's
work, which I conceive were urged upon him by Johnson; and as to the time
the booksellers would take to execute any work, I need only refer to the little
job which Mr. Johnson was to get done for our friend Dally.  He promised it
in a fortnight, and it is now three months and is not yet completed. I could
not avoid saying thus much in justice to our good Seagrave, whose replies
to Mr. Johnson's aggravating letters have been represented to Mr. Rose in
an unfair light, as I have no doubt; because Mr. Johnson has, at times, written
such letters to me as would have called for the sceptre of Agamemnon rather
than the tongue of Ulysses, and I will venture to give it as my settled opinion
that if you suffer yourself to be persuaded to print in London you will be
cheated every way; but, however, as some little excuse, I must say that in
London every calumny and falsehood utter'd against another of the same trade
is thought fair play.  Engravers, Painters, Statuaries, Printers, Poets, we
are not in a field of battle, but in a City of Assassinations. This makes
your lot truly enviable, and the country is not only more beautiful on account
of its expanded meadows, but also on account of its benevolent minds.  My
wife joins with me in the hearty wish that you may long enjoy your beautiful

Great Newport Street, before he went; took the house in Cavendish Square immediately

&amp; indeed it is not only my opinion but that of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
Flaxman &amp; M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parker both of whom I have consulted
that to give a true Idea of Romneys Genius nothing less than some Finishd
Engravings will do. as Outline intirely omits his chief beauties. but there
are some which may be executed in a slighter manner than others. &amp; M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parker whose Eminence as an Engraver makes his opinion deserve

4 in a less Finishd—&amp; on my desiring him to tell me for what he
Would undertake to Engrave One in Each manner the size to be about 7 Inches
by 5 1/4 which is the size of a Quarto printed Page. he answerd. 30 Guineas
the finishd. &amp; half the sum for the less finishd. but as you tell me that
they will be wanted in November I am of opinion that if Eight different Engravers
are Employd the Eight Plates will not be done by that time, as for myself.
(Note Parker now speaks) I have today turned away a Plate of 400 Guineas because
I am too full <add>&lt;of work&gt;</add> to undertake it, &amp; I know that all
the Good Engravers are so Engaged that they will be hardly prevaild <add>&lt;upon&gt;</add> to undertake more than One of the Plates on so short a notice.
This is M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parkers account of the matter. &amp; perhaps
may discourage you from the Pursuit of so Expensive an undertaking. it is
certain that the Pictures deserve to be Engraved by the hands of Angels &amp;
must not by any means be done in a careless or too hasty manner.  The Price
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parker has affixd to each is Exactly what I myself
had before concluded upon. judging as he did that if the Fuseli Shakespeare
is worth 25 Guineas, these will be at least worth 30, &amp; that the inferior

of it, but hoped to be able to send, before now, proofs of the two plates,
the <hi rend="i">Head</hi> of R<supplied>[omney]</supplied> and the <hi rend="i">

received your kind favour.</p><p>I take the extreme pleasure of expressing my joy at our good Lady
of Lavant's continued recovery: but with a mixture of sincere sorrow on account
of the beloved Councillor.  My wife returns her heartfelt thanks for your
kind inquiry concerning her health.  She is surprisingly recovered.  Electricity
is the wonderful cause; the swelling of her legs and knees is entirely reduced.
 She is very near as free from rheumatism as she was five years ago, and we
have the greatest confidence in her perfect recovery.</p><p>The pleasure of seeing another poem from your hands has truly set
me longing (my wife say I ought to have said us) with desire and curiosity;
but, however, “Christmas is a-coming.”</p><p>     Our good and kind friend Hawkins is not yet in town—hope soon
to have the pleasure of seeing him, with the courage of conscious industry,
worthy of his former kindness to me.  For now! O Glory! and O Delight!  I
have entirely reduced that spectrous Fiend to his station, whose annoyance
has been the ruin of my labours for the last passed twenty years of my life.
 He is the enemy of conjugal love and is the Jupiter of the Greeks, an iron-hearted
tyrant, the ruiner of ancient Greece.  I speak with perfect confidence and
certainty of the fact which has passed upon me.  Nebuchadnezzar had seven
times passed over him; I have had twenty; thank God I was not altogether a
beast as he was; but I was a slave bound in a mill among beasts and devils;
these beasts and these devils are now, together with myself, become children
of light and liberty, and my feet and my wife's feet are free from fetters.
 O lovely Felpham, parent of Immortal Friendship, to thee I am eternally indebted
for my three years' rest from perturbation and the strength I now enjoy. 
Suddenly, on the day after visiting the Truchsessian Gallery of pictures,
I was again enlightened with the light I enjoyed in my youth, and which has
for exactly twenty years been closed from me as by a door and by window-shutters.
 Consequently I can, with confidence, promise you ocular demonstration of
my altered state on the plates I am now engraving after Romney, whose spiritual
aid has not a little conduced to my restoration to the light of Art.  O the
distress I have undergone, and my poor wife with me. Incessantly labouring
and incessantly spoiling what I had done well.  Every one of my friends was
astonished at my faults, and could not assign a reason;<pb n="757"/> they knew
my industry and abstinence from every pleasure for the sake of study, and
yet—and yet—and yet there wanted the proofs of industry in my
works.  I thank God with entire confidence that it shall be so no longer—he
is become my servant who domineered over me, he is even as a brother who was
my enemy.  Dear Sir, excuse my enthusiasm or rather madness, for I am really
drunk with intellectual vision whenever I take a pencil or graver into my
hand, even as I used to be in my youth, and as I have not been for twenty
dark, but very profitable years.  I thank God that I courageously pursued
my course through darkness.  In a short time I shall make my assertion good
that I am become suddenly as I was at first, by producing the <hi rend="i">
Head of Romney</hi> and the <hi rend="i">Shipwreck</hi> quite another thing
from what you or I ever expected them to be.  In short, I am now satisfied
and proud of my work, which I have not been for the above long period.</p><p>If our excellent and manly friend Meyer is yet with you, please to

him, also to our kind friend at Lavant.</p><p>I remain, with my wife's joint affection,</p><closer><salute rend="right">Your sincere and obliged servant,</salute><signed rend="right">WILL BLAKE</signed><supplied>[From the Gilchrist <hi rend="i">

whose high &amp; generous Spirit relinquishing the whole to me was in some
measure to be Expected.  But that he has reasons for not being able to furnish
any designs You will readily believe he says his Engagements are so multiform
that he should not be able to do them Justice. but that he will overlook &amp;
advise &amp; do all that he can to make my designs (should<pb n="758"/> they

I shall put my Name to his Designs but if it should fall out so he has Enough

the Discovery. for Friendship with such a one is better than Fame! —
I was about to have written to you to express my wish that two so unequal
labourers might not be yoked to the same Plow &amp; to desire you if you could
to get Flaxman to do the whole because I thought it would be (to say the best
of myself) like putting John Milton with John Bunyan but being at Flaxmans
taking his advice about our Engravings he mentiond his having recievd a Letter
from you on the same Day I recievd mine &amp; said somewhat, I cannot tell

at any rate it would not be premature to tell him what you had said about

related</p><p>I will soon speak with Phillips about it if you will favor me with
a line of direction how to proceed.—Hope in a few days to send Proofs

with Flaxman's advice, which he gives with all the warmth of friendship both
to you and me, it must be soon a highly finished and properly finished print;
but yet I must solicit for a supply of money, and hope you will be convinced
that the labour I have used on the two plates has left me without any resource
but that of applying to you.  I am again in want<pb n="759"/> of ten Pounds;

called finished, though Flaxman has already pronounced it so.  I beg your
remarks also on both my performances, as in their present state they will
be capable of very much improvement from a few lucky or well advised touches.
I cannot omit observing that the price Mr. Johnson gives for the plates of
Fuseli's <hi rend="i">Shakespeare</hi> (the concluding numbers of which I

I might again call.  I have however seen him this morning, &amp; he has in
the most open &amp; explicit manner offerd his service to you Expressing his
desire that I will repeat to you his regret that your last beautiful Poem
was not Publishd in the Extensive way (I speak his own words) that a Poem
of Confessedly the first Poet of England ought to be given to the Public (speaking
so I must own he won my heart) He said I know that Dodsley  was M<hi rend="sup">

&amp; if M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> H has no Engagement with any London Bookseller
I may myself be appointd by him in so honourable a concern as the Publication
of his Labours.  He then Proceeded to find fault with the Printing of our
friend the Chichester Printer.  Here I considerd it my duty to interfere.
 I expressd my own respect for our Good Seagrave &amp; said I knew your chief
intentions in Employing him were 1st to Encourage a Worthy Man &amp; 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> For the Honour of Chichester.  M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> P
immediately replied.  If M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hayley should think fit to
employ me as his Publisher I should have no objection but a pleasure in employing
his Printer &amp; have no doubt I could be of service to him in many ways
but I feel for the Honour of London Booksellers &amp; consider them as losing
a great deal of Honour in Losing the first Publication of any work of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hayleys &amp; the Public likewise are deprived of the advantage
of so extensive a diffusal as would be promoted by the methods which they
use to Publish &amp; disperse Copies into all parts to a very great amount.
 He then said.  If M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hayley is willing to dispose of
this his New Poem I will Purchase it &amp; at his own Price or any other of
his Works—For I do assure you I feel it a duty to my Profession that
I should do my Endeavour to give M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hayley's works the
first rate Elegance in Printing &amp; Paper as they hold the First in internal
value.  I then said Is it agreeable to you that I repeat what you have said
to me, To M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hayley, or will you yourself for I dare say
he will be much pleasd to hear from you. but said I.  I will if you wish (as
I shall write soon) give him (as near as I can remember.) what you have said,
&amp; hope that he will see the matter in the light you do.—He desired
I would, expressing (for which I thank him) confidence in my discretion—Such
was our conversation as near as I can recollect, I thought it best to keep
silent as to any thing like a hint of a proposal relating to Edwd 1st or the
Ballads having come from you accordingly I did not say that I knew of any
Poem but left all to you intirely.  I do think from the Liberality of this
Enterprizing Man that all Parties I mean our Friend Seagrave together with
the Author &amp; Publisher (&amp; also the Public) may be mutually &amp; extensively
benefitted.<pb n="762"/> His connexions are Universal his present House is

he may return them when he has read them.  Such is his determination to do

as impolitic, and that a handsome general edition of your works would be more
productive.  He likewise objects to any periodical mode of publishing any
of your works, as he thinks it somewhat derogatory, as well as unprofitable.
 I must now express my thanks for your generous manner of<pb n="763"/> proposing
the <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi> to him on my account, and inform you of his
advice concerning them; and he thinks that they should be published <hi rend="i">
all together</hi> in a volume the size of the small edition of the <hi rend="i">
Triumphs of Temper</hi>, with six or seven plates.  That one thousand copies
should be the first edition, and, if we choose, we might add to the number
of plates in a second edition.  And he will go equal shares with me in the
expense and the profits, and that Seagrave is to be the printer.  That we
must consider all that has been printed as lost, and begin anew, unless we
can apply some of the plates to the new edition.  I consider myself as only
put in trust with this work, and that the copyright is for ever yours.  I
therefore beg that you will not suffer it to be injured by my ignorance, or
that it should in any way be separated from the grand bulk of your literary
property.  Truly proud I am to be in possession of this beautiful little estate;
for that it will be highly productive I have no doubt, in the way now proposed;
and I shall consider myself a robber to retain more than you at any time please
to grant.  In short, I am tenant at will, and may write over my door, as the
poor barber did, “Money for live here.”</p><p>I entreat your immediate advice what I am to do, for I would not for
the world injure this beautiful work, and cannot answer P.'s proposal till
I have your directions and commands concerning it; for he wishes to set about
it immediately, and has desired that I will give him my proposal concerning
it in writing.</p><closer><salute rend="right">I remain, dear Sir,<lb/>Your obliged and affectionate

I have engraved one of the plates for that ballad of <hi rend="i">The Horse
</hi> which is omitted in the new edition; time enough to save the extreme
loss and disappointment which I should have suffered had the work been completed
without that ballad's insertion.  I write to entreat that you would contrive
so as that my plate may come into the work, as its omission would be to me
a loss that I could not now sustain, as it would cut off ten guineas from
my next demand on Phillips, which sum I am in absolute want of; as well as
that I should lose all the labour I have been at on that plate, which I consider
as one of my best; I know it has cost me immense labour.  The way in which
I discovered this mistake is odd enough.  Mr. Phillips objects altogether
to the insertion of my Advertisement, calling it an appeal to charity, and
says it will hurt the sale of the work, and he sent to me the last sheet by
the penny (that is, the twopenny) post, desiring that I would forward it to
Mr. Seagrave. But I have inclosed it to you, as you ought and must see it.
 I am no judge in these matters, and leave all to your decision, as I know
that you will do what is right on all hands.  Pray accept my and my wife's

1806) 520-521, undated]</supplied></opener><salute rend="left">SIR,</salute><p>My indignation was exceedingly moved at reading a criticism in Bell's
Weekly Messenger (25th May) on the picture of Count Ugolino, by Mr. Fuseli,
in the Royal Academy exhibition; and your Magazine being as extensive in its
circulation as that Paper, as it also must from its nature be more permanent,
I take the advantageous opportunity to counteract the widely-diffused malice
which has for many years, under the pretence of admiration of the arts, been
assiduously sown and planted among the English public against true art, such
as it existed in the days of Michael Angelo and Raphael.  Under pretence of
fair criticism and candour, the most wretched taste ever produced has been
upheld for many, very many years: but now, I say, now its end is come. Such
an artist as Fuseli is invulnerable, he needs not my defence; but I should
be ashamed not to set my hand and shoulder, and whole strength, against those
wretches who, under pretence of criticism, use the dagger and the poison.</p><p>My criticism on this picture is as follows:</p><p>Mr. Fuseli's Count Ugolino is the father of sons of feeling and dignity,
who would not sit looking in their parent's face in the moment of his agony,
but would rather retire and die in secret, while they suffer him to indulge
his passionate and innocent grief, his innocent and venerable madness, and
insanity, and fury, and whatever paltry cold hearted critics cannot, because
they dare not, look upon.  Fuseli's Count Ugolino is a man of wonder and admiration,
of resentment against man and devil, and of humilitation before God; prayer
and parental affection fills the figure from head to foot.  The child in his
arms, whether boy or girl signifies not, (but the critic must be a fool who
has not read Dante, and who does not know a boy from a girl); I say, the child
is as beautifully drawn as it is coloured—in both, inimitable! and the
effect of the whole is truly sublime, on account of that very colouring which
our critic calls black and heavy.  The German flute colour, which was used
by the Flemings, (they call it burnt bone), has possessed the eye of certain
connoisseurs, that they cannot see appropriate colouring, and are blind to
the gloom of a real terror.</p><p>The taste of English amateurs has been too much formed upon pictures
imported from Flanders and Holland; consequently our countrymen are easily
brow-beat on the subject of painting; and hence it is so common to hear a
man say, “I am no judge of pictures:” but, O Englishmen! know
that every man ought to be a judge of pictures, and every man is so who has
not been connoisseured out of his senses.</p><p>     A gentleman who visited me the other day, said, “I am very much
surprised<pb n="769"/> at the dislike that some connoisseurs shew on viewing
the pictures of Mr. Fuseli; but the truth is, he is a hundred years beyond
the present generation.” Though I am startled at such an assertion,
I hope the contemporary taste will shorten the hundred years into as many
hours; for I am sure that any person consulting his own eyes must prefer what
is so supereminent; and I am as sure that any person consulting his own reputation,
or the reputation of his country, will refrain from disgracing either by such
ill-judged criticisms in future.</p><closer><salute rend="right">Yours,</salute><signed rend="right">WM. BLAKE.

beginning</p><lg><l n="1">Come lovely Chauntress of the lonely Bow'r,</l><l n="2">(Allured by vernal airs to chequer'd shades)</l></lg><p>on the grounds of circumstantial evidence and the plausible supposition
that Blake <hi rend="i">might</hi> have written such a poem about 1782, or
earlier, but rejected it from his <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi>.  “It
was etched on copper by George Cumberland and, according to his account, printed
as counter-proofs by William Standen Blake, of Exchange Alley, Chancery Lane,
in 1784.”</p><p>The diction and sentiments of “To the Nightingale” vaguely
resemble those of much poetry of the 1780's, including Blake's; yet the internal
evidence is unimpressive.  The Blake Concordance reveals no clusters of words
used by Blake, except for the formulaic “smooth the wrinkled brow of
Care” (line 18) which is matched in Blake by “care sitteth in
the Wrinkled brow” (“then She bore Pale desire” p 447, above).
 Blake never, in any spelling, used the words Chauntress, vernal, chequer'd,
glades, Minstrels'y, chiding, fern, woodbine, peer (verb), undulating, check't,
recall, peal, apathy, heifer, rudely, illuminate. Cumberland himself seems
a more likely author.</p><p>     (For the technique of concordance testing, see Erdman, “Newspaper
Sonnets Put to the Concordance Test. . .” <hi rend="i">Bulletin of The

</p><p>A more evidently genuine “piece of Blakean doggerel written
in pale blue watercolour with a brush” and discovered by Geoffrey Keynes
is “The Phoenix to Mrs Butts,” a manuscript now in the family
of a great-grandson of Mrs. Butts and signed by an authenticated Blake signature.
