Rather than printing new impressions from the copperplates, Blake gathered together impressions remaining from several earlier printings.  Objects 2-28, 34-37 as arranged in this copy were probably printed in 1789.  Objects 1, 29-33, 38-54 as arranged in this copy were probably printed in 1794 or 1795.  Blake colored the plates, or added more coloring to plates previously colored, in 1806.  "The Clod &amp; the Pebble," object 55 as arranged in this copy, is a posthumous impression not part of Blake's original collation and numbering of the book.  This plate was probably printed by Frederick Tatham c. 1832; the coloring may be of a still later date by a different hand.  "The Clod &amp; the Pebble" was probably added by Frederick Locker between c. 1866 and 1886, when he owned the volume.  He inscribed the object in pencil, "I inserted this— ?colouring more modern."</note></printdate><numberobj>55</numberobj><objorder>Bentley plates 1-5, 25, 11, 8, 15, 9, 10, 54, 18, 12, 16, 17, 6, 7, 27, 22, 23, 53, 24, 19, 13, 14, 20, 21, 26, 28-31, 15, 34-36, 50, 37, 42, 46, 44, 39, 38, 41, 45, 47, 40, 49, 48, 51, 33, 43, 52, 32<note>Bentley plate numbers are used here unless otherwise stated.  Bentley plate 15, "Laughing Song," appears in both the "Innocence" and "Experience" sections of this copy, objects 9 and 34.  Its repetition in the "Experience" section was probably caused by its presence on the recto of the only available (or at least minimally acceptable) impression of plate 34, "The Little Girl Lost," on hand in Blake's stock of prints.  He apparently decided that it was preferable to repeat Bentley plate 15 in "Experience" rather than to exclude from this copy the three-plate sequence of "The Little Girl Lost" and "The Little Girl Found" (objects 35-37 as arranged in this copy).

The volume also contained the following inserted materials: an anonymous two-page manuscript parody in purple ink entitled "A Song of Innonsense" (inserted before 1852), a three-page letter from Alexander Gilchrist dated 25 Oct. 1861 (apparently to Robert Arthington, then the owner of the volume), and a two-page transcription by Frederick Locker of a passage from Algernon Charles Swinburne, <hi rend="i">William Blake: A Critical Essay</hi>, 1868 (laid in loose by Locker between 1868 and 1886, when he owned the volume).

                  long-haired lower figure, bends almost to a prone position, as if she has been crawling on the

                  then give way to flame- or smoke-like curls that reach into both upper corners of the plate.  An ascending bird

                  of "SONGS."  To the right, also on the "S," is a seated figure, facing right and hunched

                  the loopy tendril that terminates near the bird with long tail feathers that ascends to the right of 
                  stanza 6.  Other birds fly to the right of lines 4, 7, and 13.  The letters of the title are ornamented
                  with elaborate extensions and flourishes.  The three capital letters, along with the "h" of
                  "Anothers," which is decorated with a kind of forked top
                  above and a long flag below, and the coil following the final "w," are the most notable (line 2).  The left
                  margin is dominated by a lattice of branches from two thin trees rooted at bottom left.  
                  Leafless below, the branches in the upper reaches of the margin carry the suggestion of leaves,
                  and there are very loopy tendrils beside the first three stanzas that may be a separate vine or part

                  raised, appears opposite stanzas 2 and 3, although the figure merges with the tendrils in this copy.  A
                  fourth human form, left of stanza 1, stands facing right with at least one arm raised.  Blue,

                     At the midway point the vine seems to produce the loopy
                     tendril that terminates near stanza 6.  The letters of the title are ornamented with elaborate
                     extensions and flourishes.  The three capital letters, along with the "h" of "Anothers," which is 
                     decorated with a kind of forked top above and a long flag below, and the coil following the final
                     "w," are the most notable (line 2).  In the left margin is a lattice of branches from two thin trees rooted at
                     bottom left.  Leafless below, the branches in the upper reaches of the margin carry the suggestion
                     of leaves, and there are very loopy tendrils beside the first three stanzas that may be a separate
                     vine or part of the tree.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="object" location="E"><characteristic>sky</characteristic><characteristic>sunrise</characteristic><characteristic>sunset</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Blue, rose, and yellow washes suggest the sky at sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="object" location="C"><characteristic>pipe</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The standing figure at bottom left is playing a pipe.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="object" location="D"><characteristic>shadow</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A very narrow section of dark coloring suggests a shadow beneath

                  The initial "A" in the title (line 2) sprouts a plant-like structure on the left, while a loopy vine-like
                  extension dangles all the way down the left margin.  The vegetation in the upper right margin—
                  beside the "m" of "Dream" in the title—seems to be an arc of tasseled 
                  grass or grain that curves back over the title.  Beneath it—opposite stanzas 1 and 2—are three or
                  four clusters of flame-like leaves or tufts of grass.  Below those are a bit of leafy vine (after line
                  11) and a branch or root of some sort (after line 14).  In the lower right margin—opposite stanzas 4 
                  and 5—is an odd tree(?).  In front of the tree stands a figure, robed, wearing a hat, and holding a
                  staff—probably the "watchman of the night" (line 18), the glow-worm of the text in human form. 
                  He is one of four small human figures on the plate.  The other three are in the area of the title:
                  lying, presumably 
                  sleeping, on the left stroke of the initial "A"; sitting, perhaps reading, in the "D" of "Dream"; and
                  floating or flying, with arms raised horizontally, between bits of vegetation beneath the "e" of
                  "Dream."  The animal life of the poem appears in similarly tiny forms in the margins: there could
                  be an ant (the "Emmet" of line 5) to the right of line 5 and possibly another beneath the "her" in
                  line 10; a winged beetle(?) (lines 20-21) flying right of
                  line 6; and a worm or caterpillar nestled in the lower
                  right sprigs of the vegetation right of line 7.  In other copies, a second winged beetle flies to the right of line 19; in this copy, it is difficult to 
                  distinguish this mark as any kind of winged creature.  A bird, perhaps an eagle, unmentioned in the text, 
                  spreads its wings above "dream" in line 3.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="D"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>watchman</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>robe</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>arm at side</characteristic><illusobjdesc>In front of the tree in the bottom right corner stands a figure, robed, wearing a hat,

embraces a young male (wearing tights?).  He looks at her and embraces her with both arms.  At

designs.  Beneath its text, beside a tree with leafless branches that
occupies the right margin, are two figures.  At the base of the tree a
gowned female with long hair reclines, her head apparently supported by
her bent left arm.  She may be the pretty rose tree of the poem.  At her
feet, facing right and to the right of a plant or tuft of grass, is a
second figure, wearing tights(?) and sitting (or perhaps kneeling)
hunched over in a contracted position.  This may be the male speaker of
the poem who "tend[s]" the rose-tree "by day and by night" (line 8).  He
holds his visible hand on his right shoulder.  In the
sky between the two figures are one large and nine small flying birds.
A vine with several leaves springs from the lower right corner of the
