One figure,
                  probably male, is seated on the sand or stones near the water.
                  He wears a long gown that covers his knees and lower legs.  We
                  see him from the front; his knees are drawn up to his upper chest
                  in a very contracted posture.  Given the position of his right
                  foot, his legs are probably crossed at the ankles.  His hands
                  rest upon his knees, and in turn his head is bent forward and
                  rests upon his hands.  We see only the top of his head, covered
                  with curly hair.  This is probably Theotormon, "weeping" (<hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Alblion</hi>, Erdman page 47) 
                  near "the margind ocean" (<hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi>, Erdman page 51).  To the left is a giant wave, 
                  shaped like a tongue of flame.  Within this wave is a nude
                  female, shackled and chained on her left ankle.  Her right leg is
                  apparently extended behind her left.  She arches to the right, 
                  with her arms bent at the elbows and her hands clasped together
                  just below her neck in a gesture that suggests prayer or
                  supplication.  She faces down and apparently looks at the self-enclosed male below her.  Her long hair drifts behind her neck
                  and back.  She is very probably Oothoon, pleading to her lover.
                  Right and left of the wave in which she appears is a rocky cliff.
                  Wavy lines along the lower margin of the design below both
                  figures suggest small waves of the sea.  Far right is the sea,
                  showing a few indications of waves.  A sun rises or (more probably) sets on the horizon, with about half of its disc visible.  The sun's radiance extends in beams of light upwards to clouds higher in the sky.</illusobjdesc><component type="object" location="BD"><characteristic>sun</characteristic><characteristic>sunrise</characteristic><characteristic>sunset</characteristic><characteristic>radiance</characteristic><characteristic>beams of light</characteristic><characteristic>cloud</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A sun rises or (more probably) sets on the horizon, with about a third of its disc visible.

                  cave that opens onto the wave-tossed sea.  Heavy clouds fill the sky, but fail to cover the disc of the sun.  The open area where the sun
                  appears suggests an eye socket, perhaps in a skull outlined by
                  the cave and seen in left profile.  Indeterminate vegetation
                  dangles from the roof of the cave.  The figures sit or kneel on
                  large stones, or possibly sand below the central female.  On the left is a heavily-muscled and bearded male seen in left profile.  He sits or squats at the cave's mouth.  He looks
                  to the left with wide-open eyes; his face is deeply marked by
                  fear or worse; his hair stands on end.  His mouth is open and he
                  may be howling.  His knees are drawn up in a contracted position;
                  his right arm is drawn backwards as though bound behind him.
                  Large shackles are attached to both his ankles.  Two, possibly three, links of a massive chain
                  descend below his left hip.  He may be
                  bound back to back with the female directly to the right.  This
                  pair is probably Oothoon, the central female figure in <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi>,
                  and her tormentor Bromion.  She kneels, with her body bent down
                  and to the right.  Her long hair cascades over her neck and down
                  behind her head.  Her eyes may be closed, or at least sharply downcast.  Above her and to the right, an extremely    
                  contracted figure sits among rocks.  This is probably Theotormon,
                  Oothoon's ineffectual lover.  His legs appear to be crossed, with
                  the left foot prominently poised below his heavy knees.  He faces
                  down so that we see only the top of his head, covered with curly
                  hair.  His arms are wrapped around his head, with the left arm 
                  bent at the elbow and his left hand, formed into a fist, perhaps
                  clutching his curly hair.  His right arm descends along the right
                  side of his hidden face and disappears beneath his left elbow. 
                  The design may illustrate the following lines in <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi>: "Bound
                  back to back in Bromions caves terror &amp; meekness dwell / At

                  Given this textual parallel, the two figures on the left may be
                  personifications of terror (note the expression on Bromion's

She is bending forward with her head down on her knee; her left knee and long hair cover her face; the latter cascades over her lower left leg.  She faces left, and her left shoulder, arm, and leg are prominent.  Her left arm is bent, and her left hand rests on her left knee.  There appears to be a band (of jewelry?) encircling her upper left arm.  Her left leg is bent at the knee and partially extends in front of her.  Her right foot is visible under her left knee and below the drapery or cloth that covers the lower half of her body.  The underlying etched text (see Editors' Notes) indicates that she is asleep and dreaming.  Two other smaller figures appear to the left.  A nude young female figure (possibly Thiralatha as she pictures herself in her dream) stands holding, carrying, or reaching out to an infant, possibly a cherub, who floats above her.  This is probably one of the "joyful images" (Erdman page 59) Thiralatha attempts to grasp in her dream.  The standing female faces left and up; her head is bent back to look at, or possibly kiss, the infant.  She is nude with at least her left arm raised vertically and her right leg bent at the knee and extended slighty backward, right foot on tiptoe.  The infant appears to be flying or floating upside down in the air with his legs spread apart and dangling in the air.  He reaches down toward the female figure and may kiss her.  The sky behind the two embracing figures appears to be partly clear and partly cloudy, extending into darkness to the right of the design behind the tree.  The mauve coloring hints at a sunrise or sunset.  Reticulated color printing on the ground suggests vegetation of some sort, possibly moss or lichens.  The underlying etched text (see Editors' Notes) indicates that the setting is the "Vale of Leutha" (Erdman page 59).</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>Thiralatha</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent</characteristic><characteristic>arm resting</characteristic><characteristic>bending forward</characteristic><characteristic>contracted</characteristic><characteristic>facing down</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>hand resting</characteristic><characteristic>hand on knee</characteristic><characteristic>head down</characteristic><characteristic>head on hand</characteristic><characteristic>head on knee</characteristic><characteristic>hunched over</characteristic><characteristic>knee</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent at knee</characteristic><characteristic>leg drawn up</characteristic><characteristic>feet</characteristic><characteristic>left foot</characteristic><characteristic>right foot</characteristic><characteristic>shoulder</characteristic><characteristic>sitting</characteristic><characteristic>cloth</characteristic><characteristic>drapery</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>sleeping</characteristic><characteristic>dreaming</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>jewelry</characteristic><characteristic>belt</characteristic><characteristic>partly nude</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A partly nude figure, probably the female Thiralatha named in the text etched on the underlying plate (see Editors' Notes), sits hunched over and contracted in the lower center of the design.
