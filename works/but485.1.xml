                        brief reference to Christ baptizing. In the center of the design stands
                        Christ, facing forward and looking slightly up. He wears a long gown, with
                        both feet visible beneath the hem. His right leg is bent slightly backward
                        and his right foot may be on tiptoe. He has long, curly hair and a beard. A
                        halo surround his head. His left arm is at his side but bent so he can hold
                        an infant. His right arm is raised at 45 degrees, with his palm vertical and
                        dipped in a font of water, fingers spread slightly. He is in the act of
                        baptizing the infant. Christ holds in his arms a nude male infant with
                        short, curly hair. He lies on his back, facing up and looking at Christ. His
                        legs are bent and his arms are at his side but bent with his hands together
                        in a gesture of prayer. To the left of Christ is a stone baptismal font,
                        pillar-like in configuration and decorated with leaf-like patterns, perhaps
                        including acanthus. The font holds water. In front of the baptismal font
                        stand two nude children, holding hands. The child on the left is a boy with
                        short, curly hair. He faces right and looks slightly up, mouth open, at
                        Christ. His right leg is bent slightly and on tiptoe. His right arm is
                        raised horizontally. His genitals are pictured. The child on the right is a
                        girl with long, slightly curly hair. She faces left and looks up slightly at
                        Christ's right hand. Her left arm is raised at 45 degrees, but bent upward.
                        On the left side of the design stands a group of ten figures in two diagonal
                        rows. The leftmost figure in the back row is an old man with long hair and a
                        long beard. He wears a gown and faces right. His right hand is extended in
                        front of his chest. The figure second from the left in the back row is of
                        indeterminable gender. It may have long hair or wear a veil over its hair.
                        It faces right. The figure second from the right in the back row is a man
                        with curly hair and a beard. He faces right. The rightmost figure in the
                        back row is a female with long hair and a veil on her head. She faces right
                        and looks forward and down, perhaps at a child. The leftmost figure in the
                        front row is a partly nude boy, with a cloth wrapped around his shoulders,
                        over his arms, and covering his groin. He faces forward with his arms at his
                        side, and has short, curly hair. His right leg is bent with his right foot
                        at tiptoe. The figure second from the left in the front row is a nude,
                        possibly male child with short, curly hair. He is held in his mother's arms.
                        He faces right and up, embracing his mother's head with his right arm, which
                        is raised at 135 degrees. He may be kissing his mother as well, as his head
                        is bent slightly back and their lips are touching. His right leg is bent
                        slightly. The figure third from the left in the front row is a gowned female
                        with her hair put back in a braid. Both feet are visible beneath the hem of
                        her gown, and her left leg appears to be bent slightly. Her arms are at her
                        side but bent, with the left arm bent slightly upward. She holds a child,
                        probably her son, embracing him. She faces forward and looks down to the
                        left at her son. She may be kissing him. The rightmost adult in the front
                        row is a gowned female with her hair up in a braid and held by a band. She
                        stands, facing right, and with her arms at her side but bent. She holds in
                        her arms a nude child, most likely her son. The child held by the rightmost
                        female in the front row is a nude, possibly male child with short, curly
                        hair. He lies with his body horizontal in his mother's arms. He faces away
                        and up and looks to the right. His right arm is at his side but bent and
                        both legs are bent as well. The child standing on the right in the front row
                        is a girl with long hair. She wears a long gown or cloak and faces forward
                        and left but looks up and to the right. Her left arm is at her side and bent
                        upward. On the right side of the design is a group of six figures in pairs.
                        The leftmost pair consists of two gowned, kneeling children. The child on
                        the left is a girl with long hair, facing forward and looking up and to the
                        left. Her mouth may be partly open. At least one arm seems to be at her side
                        and bent upward. The rightmost figure of the pair is a boy with short, curly
                        hair. He faces left and looks up at Christ. His arms are at side and bent
                        upward with his hands together in a gesture of prayer or supplication. The
                        middle pair consists of a man and a woman. The leftmost figure is a gowned
                        female with long, slightly curly hair with a veil over it. She faces forward
                        and looks to the left at Christ. Her right arm is at her side but bent and
                        held across her body just below her breasts. The rightmost figure is a male
                        with short, curly hair wearing a shirt and breeches (possibly with a belt at
                        the waist) or tights. His right leg is bent slightly with his right foot
                        perhaps on tiptoe. He wears shoes on his feet. His left arm is at his side
                        but bent as though hugging his body. He faces left but looks up slightly
                        with left eye raised. The rightmost pair consists of two gowned old men with
                        long beards. The leftmost figure of the pair has slightly curly hair and
                        faces forward, looking left. The rightmost figure is partly bald and faces
                        left. At the top center of the design flies a dove, facing down. Its wings
                        are spread and it is surrounded by an aura. It likely represents the Holy
                        Ghost. Beams of light radiate down from the top center of the design. The
                        scene takes place in a temple, church, or baptistery with a wooden floor.
                        Nails are visible in the wooden planks on the floor. The wall along the back
                        has a square window at the center. A screen of pillars with arches stands in
                        front of the background wall.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>Christ</characteristic><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>baptizing</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing up</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>mouth open</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>feet</characteristic><characteristic>hem</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent at knee</characteristic><characteristic>tiptoe</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>halo</characteristic><characteristic>aura</characteristic><characteristic>radiance</characteristic><characteristic>arm at side</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised at 45 degrees</characteristic><characteristic>fingers spread</characteristic><characteristic>palm vertical</characteristic><illusobjdesc>In the center of the design stands Christ, facing forward and

                            and a beard. A halo surround his head. His left arm is at his side but
                            bent so he can hold an infant. His right arm is raised at 45 degrees,
                            with his palm vertical and dipped in the font of water, fingers spread
