God, riding on a fiery chariot, holds his book of laws on his lap and points toward Adam with his extended right arm.  Adam's long beard indicates that he has already been marked by mortality.</p><p>A title, "God speaking to Adam," is inscribed in pencil below the design, almost certainly not by Blake.</p></objnote><objsize>43.2 x 53.5 cm.</objsize><windowsize width="600" height="550"/></physdesc><illusdesc><illustration type="plate" location="E"><illusobjdesc>God, who is old, gowned, and bearded and has long hair, sits on a flaming chariot drawn by two horses with flame-like manes and tails.  He extends his right arm, hand, and index finger to point in judgment at the nude and hunched or bowing form of Adam, who stands before him with eyes down and face partly obscured by his long, flowing beard.  God’s left hand rests on a book or tablet (of laws?) on his lap.  God may be holding the horses' reins in his right hand, or a rod, scepter, or beam of light (?) pointing at Adam.  Beams of light radiate from the flaming disc or globe behind God.

He is bearded, gowned, and old, and has long hair.  Flames surround him as he faces to the left with his head bent slightly forward and down to look at Adam.  His expression and posture may suggest anger.  His right arm, hand, and index finger are extended to point at Adam, who stands before him; God may also be using his right hand to hold the horses' reins or a lightly-colored rod or scepter.  His left arm is bent at the elbow, and his left hand rests on the book or tablet on his lap.  His bare left foot is visible beneath the hem of his gown, and appears to be resting on a platform of the chariot.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="object" location="CD"><characteristic>book</characteristic><characteristic>tablet</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A book or tablet (of laws?) rests on God’s lap.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="object" location="AB"><characteristic>rod</characteristic><characteristic>scepter</characteristic><characteristic>beams of light</characteristic><characteristic>rein</characteristic><characteristic>line</characteristic><illusobjdesc>God may be holding a scepter or rod in his right hand, pointed toward Adam.

He faces to the right with his left leg bent behind him, and his left foot poised on tiptoe.  He may be striding toward God.  His arms (or at least his right arm) are probably bent upward, for his right hand is raised to his forehead and his palms may be together in prayer or supplication.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="object" location="AB"><characteristic>light</characteristic><characteristic>radiance</characteristic><characteristic>beams of light</characteristic><characteristic>sky</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Beams of light or radiance extend from the disc or globe behind God’s chariot and fill the sky.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="vegetation" location="C"><characteristic>grass</characteristic><characteristic>moss</characteristic><characteristic>lichens</characteristic><characteristic>indeterminate</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The hues and reticulations of the color printing suggest that grass, moss, lichens, or some such vegetation grow beneath the feet of Adam and the horses.</illusobjdesc></component></illustration></illusdesc><phystext><vspace extent="8"/><lg type="prose" justify="left"><l n="but294.1.cprint.01.01" justify="left">inv</l><l n="but294.1.cprint.01.02" justify="left">WB 1795</l></lg></phystext></desc></objdesc></bad>
