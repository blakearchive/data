The Elohim, a Hebrew word for God or Gods, grasps with his left hand some of the earth he uses to form Adam, while he molds Adam's head with his right hand.  Blake represents this act of creation as also a fall into material existence and mortality, the latter indicated by the giant worm coiled around Adam's legs.</p></objnote><objsize>43.1 x 53.6 cm.</objsize><windowsize width="600" height="550"/></physdesc><illusdesc><illustration type="plate" location="E"><illusobjdesc>Elohim, bearded and old, with long spiky hair and large, feathery wings, hovers over the supine form of Adam before a rising or setting sun.  Elohim faces forward and to the right with arms raised vertically (relative to his body, but horizontally relative to the ground) and mouth open.  He is gowned, and drapery coils beneath his prominent bare right foot.  He reaches to gather earth with his left hand, and with his right hand he touches (and probably shapes) the head of Adam.  Beneath him, Adam lies prostrate with his left arm raised vertically (relative to his body) and the fingers of his left hand slightly spread.  His head, which may be only partially formed, is bent back, and his mouth is open, perhaps in an expression of pain.  A giant worm (or snake?) coils around his legs.  Adam is nude, with prominent ribs.  Clouds encroach from above on the beams of light from the rising (or, perhaps, setting) sun.  Wisps of clouds also appear in front of the sun.  The coloring of the ground below Adam suggests grass, moss, or some sort of vegetation.  Alternatively, this may be water, perhaps the sea.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>God</characteristic><characteristic>Elohim</characteristic><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>old</characteristic><characteristic>wing</characteristic><characteristic>feather</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>spiky hair</characteristic><characteristic>creating</characteristic><characteristic>mouth open</characteristic><characteristic>right foot</characteristic><characteristic>flame-like hair</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>hair standing on end</characteristic><characteristic>drapery</characteristic><characteristic>coil</characteristic><characteristic>muscular</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing down</characteristic><characteristic>hovering</characteristic><characteristic>flying</characteristic><characteristic>shoulders</characteristic><characteristic>arms extended</characteristic><characteristic>arms raised vertically</characteristic><characteristic>arms raised horizontally</characteristic><characteristic>body horizontal</characteristic><characteristic>reaching</characteristic><characteristic>touching</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>despair</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Elohim, bearded and old with long spiky hair and large, feathery wings, hovers over the supine form of Adam before a rising or setting sun.  His arms are extended vertically (relative to his body, but horizontally relative to the ground), and he reaches to gather earth with his left hand; with his right hand he grasps (and probably shapes) the head of Adam, whom he is creating.  The muscles of Elohim's right shoulder merge with the structure of his massive wings.  Elohim faces forward and to the right with his mouth open; he is gowned, although his muscular body is clearly visible through his clothing.  Drapery coils beneath his prominent, bare right foot.

He is nude, and his ribs are prominent, giving him an emaciated appearance.  A giant worm (or snake?) coils around his lower body.
