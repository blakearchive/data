                electronic edition of thirty-three of Blake’s water color illustrations to the
                Bible. All take their subjects from the New Testament and have been added to the
                twenty Old Testament subjects published in March 2010 as “Illustrations to the
                Bible, c. 1780-1824,” under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings. This new
                group is presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the
                Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of
                Blake’s images). <lb/><lb/> Blake executed most of these New Testament water colors c. 1800-05 for his
                patron Thomas Butts. The exceptions are <hi rend="i">The Whore of Babylon</hi> of
                1809 and <hi rend="i">The Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins</hi> in the Yale
                Center for British Art, datable to c. 1825. The subjects range from the childhood of
                Jesus to his ascension, the later history of his parents and one of his major
                followers, St. Paul, and a group of eight designs based on the Book of Revelation.
                While the illustrations of the life of Christ are fairly conventional in their
                subjects, in part because of the long tradition of picturing almost every event in
                the Gospels, individual motifs recall designs in Blake’s illuminated books and thus
                offer a window on Blake’s visual interpretation of the Bible. The illustrations of
                Revelation complement Blake’s intense engagement with apocalyptic events and images
                in his own poetry. <lb/><lb/> The selection of fifty-three biblical water colors now available in the
                Archive will be supplemented in the future with early works, such as <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>, datable to c. 1780, and will continue through Blake’s
                final biblical water colors, such as <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the
                    Bulrushes</hi>. <lb/><lb/> As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access
                restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible by the
                University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with the University of Rochester, the
                continuing support of the Library of Congress, and the cooperation of the
                international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us

                        design sits the female figure of the Whore of Babylon, facing forward and
                        with her lower body facing slightly left and her upper body facing slightly
                        right. She wears a skirt with a jagged hem, possibly decorated with jewels.
                        She wears anklets and two necklaces, one of pearls or beads and one chain
                        with a heart pendant. She also wears two bracelets on each wrist and a
                        three-tiered crown on her head. Her upper body is nude and her breasts are
                        exposed. She has long curly hair, slightly flame-like, and sits with her
                        legs bent and knees drawn slightly up, legs crossed at the ankles. Her left
                        arm is raised at 45 degrees and points down and to the left. Her right arm
                        is raised at 45 degrees and bent upward. In her right hand she holds a
                        goblet or chalice. It is wrapped around with two scaly snakes, the left one
                        facing right and up and the right one facing left and up. On the goblet are
                        columns topped by arches and four gowned figures of indeterminable gender
                        standing with their arms raised at 135 degrees, facing forward, left, and
                        right. They may be dancing. A cloud (of smoke?) issues from the goblet.
                        Within the cloud are seven flying nude female figures with long hair. The
                        leftmost figure faces away and to the right. Her right leg is bent back. Her
                        left arm is raised vertically and her right arm is raised at 135 degrees and
                        bent to hold an indeterminable object, perhaps a vase or pitcher, above her
                        head as she rises upward. The second-to-left figure faces forward and up,
                        with her lower body facing left and her upper body facing right. Her legs
                        are bent, with her right leg extended backward. Her right arm is raised
                        vertically and her left arm is raised at 135 degrees and bent upward. In her
                        right hand she holds a horn or trumpet that she presumably plays. In her
                        right hand she holds what appears to be a goblet or glass. The third-to-left
                        figure faces away and to the right, bending forward. Her legs are bent with
                        her right leg extended backward. Her arms are raised at 135 degrees and
                        bent; in her hands she holds what appears to be a large goblet or a bowl.
                        The middle figure of this group faces forward, right and down. Her right leg
                        is bent and extended back. Her arms are raised at 135 degrees and crossed to
                        hold a large bowl with what may be a flame rising from it. The
                        third-to-right figure faces away, right and up. Her left leg is bent. Her
                        left arm is raised vertically and in her left hand she holds a horn or
                        trumpet which she presumably plays. Her right arm is raised vertically and
                        bent and in her right hand she may hold a goblet. The second-to-right figure
                        faces forward, left and down. She is partly upside down. Her arms are raised
                        horizontally and in her right hand she holds a goblet; in her left hand, she
                        holds a horn or trumpet, which she presumably plays. The rightmost figure is
                        upside down and faces down and right. Her right arm is raised vertically and
                        her left arm is raised at 135 degrees and bent. In her hands she holds what
                        appears to be a large goblet. The Whore of Babylon rides on the nude male
                        figure of her "beast" (Revelation 17:3). He appears to have feathers or fur
                        around his hips and shoulders, as well as a crest of spiky fins along his
                        spine. He faces left and down, crouching on the ground with his legs and
                        arms bent. His feet and hands have claws for nails and are bestial. His dark
                        veins are particularly pronounced in his hands and neck. The figure has
                        seven heads, all male with short, curly hair and horns surrounded by spiky
                        crowns. The leftmost head faces left and down and has a pointed ear. The
                        next head above faces left and down and has a pointy ear. The lowest head
                        faces left and down and has looped horns like a ram's. His mouth is open
                        with his teeth visible. He may be eating a nude human. The head just above
                        the lowest head looks down and to the left, facing forward slightly; its
                        mouth is open with its teeth visible. The head just above and slightly to
                        the left faces forward, up, and right, perhaps looking at the Whore of
                        Babylon. The highest head has a pug nose and faces forward, looking up and
                        to the right, perhaps looking at the Whore of Babylon. The rightmost head
                        appears to be old and has a beard; he faces forward and looks up and to the
                        right, perhaps at the figures emanating from the Whore of Babylon's urn. His
                        mouth is open and his upper teeth are visible. The scene takes place against
                        the backdrop of a clear sky, with a wash that may suggest sunrise or sunset.
                        A hill or distant mountain may rise from right to left behind the figures.
                        The earth at the bottom of the design appears to be bare, with a large rock
                        that the beast kneels on. There may be a line of low hills extending right
                        to left across the design. In the foreground to the left of the beast's legs
                        are at least eight figures. Most appear to be fighting soldiers. The
                        leftmost figure is that of an armored soldier, standing, facing away and
                        slightly left. His arms are raised at 135 degrees and bent upward and he
                        holds a flag. He may look at the beast. The second-to-left figure is that of
                        an armored soldier holding a sword in his right hand and a shield in his
                        left hand. He faces forward and to the right, bending forward slightly. His
                        right leg is extended back and his left leg is bent. Both legs may be on
                        tiptoe. To the right of this soldier, two figures are visible in the
                        background as sketchy heads. The third-to-right figure is an armored
                        soldier, facing right and away. He stands on his right foot, which is
                        extended back, while his left leg is bent. In his left hand he holds a
                        shield and in his right hand he holds a spear. His right arm is raised at 45
                        degrees and bent. The second-to-right figure is visible only as a nude lower
                        body, facing forward and right. He(?) is being eaten by the beast. The
                        rightmost figure of this group is that of a gowned female, standing with her
                        lower body facing left and her upper body twisted to face forward, right,
                        and up. Her right arm is at her side but bent and in her right hand she
                        holds a goblet. Her left arm is raised at 135 degrees and in her right hand
                        she holds a trumpet or horn that she presumably plays. In the foreground in
                        the bottom left corner of the design is a pile of at least five bodies. The
                        second-to-right figure faces forward and up, but the rest face down and
                        right or left. They are all probably dead. In the background between the
                        beast's head and front legs stand at least six sketchy figures, just visible
                        as heads. The three leftmost may stand facing right and the three rightmost
                        may stand facing left or away. At least five spears are visible, held by
                        members of this group. In the foreground between the beast's front leg and
                        back leg are at least seven figures and two horses. The leftmost figure is
                        an armored soldier, facing right and away. He kneels or crouches with his
                        left leg extended backward and his right leg bent and drawn slightly up. His

                        the soldier to his right. The second-to-left figure faces forward and may
                        sit, head back and mouth open. It is of indeterminable gender, but may be
                        gowned. The third-to-left figure is that of an armored soldier, facing left
                        and slightly forward. He stands with his legs bent and his left leg extended
                        backward and on tiptoe. His arms are at his side and bent, with his right
                        arm bent upward. He holds a spear and is looking at the soldier to his left.
                        The middle figure is visible only as a head, facing left. The third-to-right
                        figure lies, supine, and is of indeterminable gender. Its legs are bent and
                        its right arm is bent, and it may lean on this arms. It faces forward and to
                        the right, and looks up with its mouth open. It may be armored or wear a
                        hood. The second-to-right figure lies with its body horizontal, facing
                        forward and left. It is of indeterminable gender, but may be gowned. The
                        front horse faces left and up, rearing up or leaping. Its legs are bent and
                        extended and its head is slightly down. It wears reins and is pulling a
                        chariot. The second horse appears just behind the front horse. The rightmost
                        figure is an armored soldier sitting and riding in a chariot. He faces
                        forward and right and looks up. His left leg is bent and he leans back
                        slightly. His right arm is at his side but bent and in his left hand he
                        holds a spear. His right arm is raised horizontally and bent upward
                        slightly; in his right hand, he holds a goblet. To the right of the beast's
                        rear leg are at least two figures, one on the ground and one in the air. The
                        figure on the ground may be sitting or crouching and bending forward. It is
                        of indeterminable gender, but has its legs bent and its left arm raised
                        horizontally with its hand on the ground. It faces left and down and is
                        hunched over. The figure in the air faces down, left, and away as it hovers
                        or descends. It appears to be nude and is of indeterminable gender. Its
                        right leg is bent and its arms are raised vertically. The figure plays two
                        trumpets or horns held in its hands.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>Whore of Babylon</characteristic><characteristic>partly nude</characteristic><characteristic>skirt</characteristic><characteristic>upper body</characteristic><characteristic>breasts</characteristic><characteristic>hem</characteristic><characteristic>jewelry</characteristic><characteristic>necklace</characteristic><characteristic>heart</characteristic><characteristic>bracelet</characteristic><characteristic>earring</characteristic><characteristic>pearl</characteristic><characteristic>beads</characteristic><characteristic>crown</characteristic><characteristic>sitting</characteristic><characteristic>riding</characteristic><characteristic>legs bent</characteristic><characteristic>legs crossed</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>flame-like hair</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>leg drawn up</characteristic><characteristic>legs crossed</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised at 45 degrees</characteristic><characteristic>pointing</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent upward</characteristic><illusobjdesc>In the center of the design sits the female figure of the
