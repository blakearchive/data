            The editors of the William Blake Archive http://www.iath.virginia/edu/blake are pleased to announce the publication of four new electronic editions of Blake's illuminated books. They are: <hi rend="i">The Ghost of Abel</hi> Copy A (The Library of Congress), <hi rend="i">On Homers Poetry [and] On Virgil</hi> Copies B (The Fitzwilliam Museum) and F (The Pierpont Morgan Library), <hi rend="i">Laocoön</hi> Copy B (collection of Robert N. Essick).<lb/><lb/>
            These three works are Blake's final illuminated books, their composition dateable between 1822 (<hi rend="i">The Ghost of Abel</hi>, <hi rend="i">On Homers Poetry [and] On Virgil</hi>) and c. 1826-27 (<hi rend="i">Laocoön</hi>). In the words of Sir Geoffrey Keynes, they offer Blake's "Last Testament" on subjects ranging from aesthetic theory to political economy, from forgiveness to apocalyptic judgment. A drama in miniature, <hi rend="i">The Ghost of Abel</hi> addresses "Lord Byron in the Wilderness" (Plate 1) and, more specifically, the issues of vengeance and forgiveness raised by Byron's <hi rend="i">Cain: A Mystery</hi> (1821). The broadsheet <hi rend="i">On Homers Poetry [and] On Virgil</hi> challenges these representative figures of classical learning, with special emphasis on concepts of unity as an artistic ideal, identity, and the destructive consequences of imperialism. There are five copies extant for each of these works, which, like most of Blake's illuminated books, were produced in relief etching; the <hi rend="i">Laocoön</hi> plate, which is an intaglio etching/engraving, is extant in two copies. Through a careful representation and restoration of the famous Hellenistic sculptural group, Blake attempts to return the Laocoön to its supposed Hebraic origins and its allegorical meanings, revealed by the terse yet intellectually expansive texts with which Blake surrounds the central image.<lb/><lb/>
            All of these editions have newly edited SGML-encoded texts and are all fully searchable for both text and images and supported by the unique Inote and ImageSizer applications described in our previous updates. We now have twenty-six copies of sixteen illuminated books in the Archive. Late this year and early in the next, we will add <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> Copy D and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> Copy E. We will also be adding at least six more copies of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi>, two copies of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi>, five copies of <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>, four copies of <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen</hi>, and two copies each of <hi rend="i">America, a Prophecy</hi> and <hi rend="i">Europe, a Prophecy</hi>. In addition, by the end of 1998 we will provide a fully-searchable SGML edition of David V. Erdman's <hi rend="i">Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</hi>.<lb/><lb/>
            In the coming weeks we will also be opening a brand-new wing of the Archive, consisting of an extensive array of supporting materials: an updated and expanded Plan of the Archive, a statement of Editorial Principles and Methodology, a summary of the Archive's technical design and implementation, a list of Frequently Asked Questions, an in-depth illustrated Tour highlighting the Archive's features and some ways to use its resources, and more. Our hope is that these extensive documentary materials will prove valuable both to our own growing user community as well as to scholars interested in the theory and practice of electronic editing more generally. We will make a separate announcement when these materials are available on the site.<lb/><lb/>
            Finally, on our recently opened Contributing Collections page, we plan to begin adding color-coded and linked lists of each institution's entire Blake collection to indicate what is and is not in the Archive and what is forthcoming. In addition to providing a convenient index of the scope and contents of the Archive, these lists should also be useful to scholars in planning research trips.

of the famous Hellenistic sculptural group, the Laocoön, very
probably copied by Blake after the plaster copy in the Royal
Academy, London.  The three figures are raised on a plinth, with
two steps above it and a wall or pedestal behind the lower bodies
of the figures.  While the original statue represents the Trojan
priest, Laocoön, and his two sons, Blake has reinterpreted it as a
work of Hebraic art representing Jehovah and his two sons, Adam and
Satan, struggling with two serpents, labeled on the plate "Evil" (line 5)
and "Good" (line 31).  Both serpents coil around all three figures; both have
their mouths open and are biting Laocoön and the son on the left. 
The central nude figure of Laocoön/God is bearded and his hair is
long.  His mouth is slightly open and his visage expresses great
pain.  His genitals are clearly pictured.  He faces forward, with
his right leg bent at the knee and his left leg extended to the
right.  His legs are spread apart; we see between them a cascade of
drapery or a robe falling from the man's body.  His neck is twisted
so that he faces up and to the left.  His right arm is raised at
145 degrees; his left is bent at the elbow and reaches downward. 
He holds the serpent of "Good" in both hands.  The nude, youthful
son on the left struggles with the serpent of "Evil."  He has been
identified as Adam by some scholars, but he is probably Satan (see
the evidence below that the other son is Adam).  His hair is long;
his face suggests pain.  His body faces forward, but his neck is
twisted so that his head is bent back and facing to the right. 
Both legs are bent at the knees.  His right arm is bent upward,
with the fingers of his right hand spread apart above his head. 
His left arm is bent over his body; his left hand grasps the head
of the snake.  A bit of drapery appears below his right thigh.  The
youthful, muscular nude son on the right has been identified as
Satan by some scholars, but he is more probably Adam (given the
inscription of the name Lilith, Adam's legendary first wife, in
Hebrew under the figure's right arm).  He faces forward, with his
neck twisted so that his face is seen in profile to the left.  His
mouth is slightly open and his hair is curly.  He stands on his
right leg; his left leg is bent sharply at the knee and drawn up
toward his torso.  His right arm is bent upward, with his raised
right hand palm out and fingers spread.  His left arm reaches
downward, with the left hand holding the serpent wrapped around his
left ankle.  Drapery cascades over his left shoulder and reaches to
the plinth near his right foot (which touches the left foot of the
central figure).  The signature is placed so that it seems to be an
inscription cut into the stone plinth.</illusobjdesc><component type="object" location="E"><characteristic>group of figures</characteristic><characteristic>statue</characteristic><characteristic>plinth</characteristic><characteristic>step</characteristic><characteristic>wall</characteristic><characteristic>pedestal</characteristic><characteristic>stone</characteristic><characteristic>classical art</characteristic><illusobjdesc>This single, separate plate is a careful reproduction
