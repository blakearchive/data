In the center of the design, the Virgin Mary sits on a chair (not clearly pictured) raised on a step or plinth, with an arched alcove behind it. She is gowned and has long hair, which is covered by a veil. She faces forward and slightly down, with her mouth open. She may be looking at the infant Jesus, whom she holds in her arms, which are bent into her lap. On her lap appears to be a cloth separate from her gown. In Mary's arms is the infant Jesus. He appears to be nude with short hair and faces up. His right arm is raised horizontally (relative to his body) and clutches at Mary's chest. He may be looking at Mary's face. To the left of Mary kneels a man with long, curly hair and a beard.  He is the *Mohel* who will perform the circumcision. He faces right and wears a gown. He is looking at his right hand, in which he holds a small knife; his left hand appears to be holding Jesus's penis, as though preparing to circumcise him. On the left stands a group of four figures, all gowned and facing partly forward and partly to the right. The leftmost figure appears to be a young male, but only his head is visible. He has short, curly hair. The figure second from the left is an older male with curly hair and a beard. His arms are bent upward, with his palms raised vertically, as though about to put them together in a gesture of prayer. He might be Joseph. The next figure to the right is female with long hair. Her left hand is visible, with the palm raised vertically and facing out, possibly in blessing. The rightmost figure is female, with a veil (or scarf or cloth of some sort) covering her hair. Her left palm is also raised vertically and facing out, possibly in blessing. On the right stands a gowned male with long hair and a beard. He is the rabbi overseeing the circumcision. He faces left but looks up slightly, as though praying. His right arm is raised at 135 degrees over Mary's and Jesus's heads in an act of blessing, while his left arm is raised at 45 degrees. He holds a book, perhaps a copy of the Bible or Torah, in his left hand, and seems to rest it on his left thigh. We see the edges of the book's pages. To the right of the rabbi stands a group of three figures, all gowned and facing left. The leftmost figure is female with long hair who wears a veil (or scarf or cloth of some sort) on her head. Only the head of the middle figure is visible, an old man with long hair and a beard. The rightmost figure is also an old man with long hair and a beard, who seems to have his left arm bent across his body.
