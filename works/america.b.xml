      <seriesstmt>The William Blake Archive</seriesstmt>
      <updatestmt>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of electronic editions of 
        <hi rend="i">America a Prophecy</hi>
        Copies B and I. Ten of the fourteen extant copies of 
        <hi rend="i">America</hi>
        were printed in 1793, the date on its title plate. Copy I, now in the Huntington Library and Art Gallery, is from this printing. The eighteen plates of Copy I, like those of the other 1793 copies but unlike those of the later copies, were printed on two sides of the leaves, except for the frontispiece and title page (plates 1 and 2), and left uncolored. The plates were printed in greenish-black ink; five lines at the end of the text on plate 4 were masked and did not print, and plate 13 is in its first state. Copy B was printed in 1795 with Copy A in the same brownish black ink on one side of the paper, with plate 13 in its second state. Unlike Copy A, however, it is uncolored except for gray wash on the title plate. Now in the Morgan Library and Museum, Copy B has a very curious history. Its plates 4 and 9, which were long assumed to be original, are in fact lithographic facsimiles from the mid 1870s produced to complete the copy. For a full technical description and history of this copy, see Joseph Viscomi, “Two Fake Blakes Revisited; One Dew-Smith Revealed.” 
        <hi rend="i">Blake in Our Time: Essays in Honour of G. E. Bentley, Jr.</hi>
        Ed. Karen Mulhallen. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2010. 35-78. Copies B and I join six other copies in the Archive, Copies E and F (1793), A (1795), M (c. 1807), and O (1821), which altogether represent the full printing history of this illuminated book.
        <lb/>
        <lb/>
        <hi rend="i">America a Prophecy</hi>
        was the first of Blake's &quot;Continental Prophecies,&quot; followed by 
        <hi rend="i">Europe a Prophecy</hi>
        in 1794, executed in the same style and size but usually colored, and, in 1795, &quot;Africa&quot; and &quot;Asia,&quot; two sections making up 
        <hi rend="i">The Song of Los</hi>
        . Fine and important examples of all three works are in the Archive. Like all the illuminated books in the Archive, the text and images of 
        <hi rend="i">America</hi>
        Copies B and I are fully searchable and are supported by the Archive's Compare feature. New protocols for transcription, which produce improved accuracy and fuller documentation in editors' notes, have been applied to Copies B and I and to all the 
        <hi rend="i">America</hi>
        texts previously published.
        <lb/>
        <lb/>
        With the publication of these two copies, the Archive now contains fully searchable and scalable electronic editions of 85 copies of Blake's nineteen illuminated books in the context of full bibliographic information about each work, careful diplomatic transcriptions of all texts, detailed descriptions of all images, and extensive bibliographies. In addition to illuminated books, the Archive contains many important manuscripts and series of engravings, color printed drawings, tempera paintings, and water color drawings.
        <lb/>
        <lb/>
        Due to recent security concerns related to Java browser plugins, the Archive has disabled its Java-based ImageSizer and Virtual Lightbox applications. Users can still view 100 and 300 dpi JPEG images as well as complete transcriptions for all works in the Archive including 
        <hi rend="i">America</hi>
        Copies B and I. Text searching is also still available for all works in the Archive, and image searching remains available for all works except those in preview mode. In the coming months the Archive will implement redesigned pages that restore the features of ImageSizer and the Virtual Lightbox without the use of Java.

            In Copies C-I, K, L, and R, the word &quot;Preludium&quot; (not &quot;PRELUDIUM,&quot; pace Bentley page 91 and Erdman page 802) is printed from a small, separate copperplate, plate e, 2.4 x 8.0 cm. In Copies A, B, and O, the word &quot;Preludium&quot; is omitted.  In Copy M, &quot;PRELUDIUM&quot; (all capitals) is written by hand.  Plate 11 is in the second of two states, with additional white line work in the lower left margin and just above the bottom edge of the plate.  The first state is found only in Copy L.  Plate 13 is in the second state, with one tail on the snake, lower left.  Plates 4 and 9 in this copy are lithographic reproductions, perhaps based on Copy F.  For a full explanation, see Joseph Viscomi, &quot;Two Fake Blakes Revisited; One Dew-Smith Revealed,&quot;

        <medium>Relief etching, with extensive white-line etching on
Objects 1, 8, 10, 11, and 15, and gray wash on Object 2 (the title page).  Most other objects bear at least
touches of white-line etching/engraving.
          <note>Objects 4 and 9 are lithographic reproductions; see the note following Number of Objects, above.  There are inscriptions and sketches, not by Blake, on the versos of Objects 1 (bound as a recto because Object 1, the frontispiece, faces Object 2, the title page), 2, and 17.  The small drawing (a branch or vine with many thin leaves) on the back of Object 1 appears under an inscription, &quot;Mary Taylor London.&quot; This drawing is in the same brown ink, and appears to have been executed with the same pen, as the inscription.  This drawing is very probably by Taylor.  The ink drawing of a winged human figure, probably an angel, on the verso of Object 2 might be by Taylor, or by C. H. Tatham, the first owner of the volume, or by Albert George Dew-Smith, who owned the volume from c. 1874 to 1878 (see the note on Provenance, below).  The pencil sketches on the verso of Object 17 may be by Tatham or Dew-Smith.  They include two heads in profile, a head and torso in profile, possibly a duck, and a landscape including a walking figure, a tree, and a building or gravestone with a cross above.  For these verso inscriptions and sketches, see Related Works in the Archive. For the pen and ink sketch added to Object 5, see the Editors' Notes on Object 5.</note></medium>

        <illustration location="E" type="plate">
          <illusobjdesc id="d0e451">The design embodies the destructiveness of warfare. 
In the middle distance is a stone wall with, on the right, the
fragments of a top carved with classical motifs.  A great gap
appears to the left, and in this gap sits a giant winged figure. 
He is nude and muscular, with prominent knees and feet and both
arms shackled and chained to the ground or to the remnants of the wall on which he
squats or sits.  His legs are drawn up in an extremely contracted
posture, with his knees to his shoulders.  His head is lowered and
rests on his knees; his face is not pictured.  His hair is long and
curly.  The contracted posture and lowered head suggest despair. 
He may be Albion's Angel, the representative of the establishment
forces, or Orc, the personification of revolution.  To the right
is a family group, all nude.  A woman, very probably a mother,
sits on a fragment of the stone wall, legs crossed.  Her hair is long and her
face expresses a brooding fear, despair, or simply exhaustion. 
She holds in her lap a young child, probably male.  He
faces forward but perhaps looks up toward the woman.  His
(right?) knee is prominent.  Another child, of uncertain gender,
leans against the woman's left thigh and hip and hides his or her
head below the woman's left arm.  This figure's legs are crossed
at the ankles.  We see this figure from behind.  On the ground
below the woman is the haft of a broken sword, and further to the
left is a dismounted cannon.  The sky is dominated by dark
clouds, perhaps of smoke.</illusobjdesc>

        <illustration location="E" type="plate">
          <illusobjdesc id="d0e787">The lowest part of the design is formed of male
corpses stacked like cord wood.  We see, on the first level of
the stack, the tops of the heads and horizontally-extended arms
of two rigid bodies lying prone.  The next layer is a single
rigid body, lying supine, with his legs extended to the right and
his arms at his side.  He faces up.  Above him is a gowned woman
with long hair, lying on top of him with her left leg drawn up
and her right leg extended.  She embraces the man around the neck
with her left arm.  Her face, seen in profile, touches the dead
or dying man's face below her; she may be kissing him, trying to
resuscitate him, or simply mourning over him.  Her mouth is partly open.  The dark sky above
these figures contains a few diagonal white lines that may
indicate rain or sleet descending from the clouds above.  These
large clouds bear the title, as though inscribed upon them, and
six figures.  On the left, a gowned woman with long hair sits
with right leg extended before her and her left leg bent back
behind her.  She faces and hunches over to the left, apparently
holding a book or tablet also being looked at or read by a gowned
child, probably male, with curly hair.  He stands before the
woman and faces right, but is probably looking down at the book
or tablet.  At least his right arm is extended horizontally and
may rest on the book or tablet.  Behind the woman is another
figure, perhaps nude and female, sitting with legs extended and
her back leaning against the back of the woman.  Although the
scale of the figures is uncertain, this may be a child or young
girl.  Another group of three figures is on the right.  An old,
bearded man with long hair sits facing to the right.  He wears a
heavy gown and hunches over a book or tablet on his lap, at which
he appears to be looking and perhaps reading.  His posture is
contracted, in contrast to the figure to the right--a nude female
hovering in the air.  We see her from behind; her posture is
gracefully twisted.  Her left arm is raised horizontally, her
right arm at 135 degrees.  The index finger on her right hand
points upward.  Her right leg is extended, her left drawn up.  Her hair is
in a bun.  Behind the old man is a nude male, youthful and facing
to the right although his body is turned to the left and leans
against the back of the old man.  His legs are crossed and he
points upward and to the left with his right arm, hand, and
extended index finger at an angle of 135 degrees.  His left arm
is bent and supported against the old man's back.  Although these
two nude figures are much smaller than the old man, they are
probably not children but energetic representations of spiritual
states unperceived, or ignored, by the old man.  The two large
figures with books or tablets have sometimes been identified as a
sibyl and a prophet.  Alternatively, the male may be a
priest.</illusobjdesc>

          <illusobjdesc id="d0e1307">Although the plate contains considerable text, it
appears as though the plate is treated as a single design
extending across the top one third, down the left margin, and
across the lower margin.  A large tree, perhaps an oak, with
arching branches dominates the top left of the design.  The
vegetation right and left of the large trunk may be separate
bushes.  Below and to the right of its trunk is a large stone or
earthen bank (with a few tufts of grass) to which is shackled a
nude, youthful male by both hands and feet.  His arms are spread
out horizontally on the rock, as if crucified; his legs are also
spread apart.  His torso and neck are twisted, perhaps in pain;
he faces up.  His mouth is open; he may be speaking or crying in
pain.  His hair is curly; he is probably Orc, the spirit of
revolution here restrained.  To the right are a nude male and
female, both standing.  The female, with legs spread apart,
grasps her head with both hands, as if in mourning or despair. 
We do not see her face, but her upper torso is twisted to the
left--toward the shackled youth.  She may be Enitharmon, Orc's
mother.  Further to the right, the male stands with legs spread
apart.  His body faces us, but he turns his head to the left and
may be looking at the shackled youth.  His arms, with elbows
bent, are raised over his head, with his hands raised, palms out,
and the fingers of both hands spread apart.  His hair is spiky or
flame-like; his general expression is one of horror or grief. 
His mouth is slightly open; he may be speaking or crying out in
sorrow.  This may be Los, Orc's father.  Alternatively, the
couple has been identified as Adam and Eve, or as the &quot;Dark
virgin&quot; and Urthona (another name for Los) mentioned on this
plate (lines 12, 2).  The roots of the tree descend through the left
margin, perhaps taking on anthropomorphic shapes.  At the end of
the roots, in the far lower left corner of the plate, sits or
squats a nude, youthful male in a severely contracted posture. 
His legs are drawn up, with his head resting on his knees.  He
faces forward, with a grim expression, and holds his crossed
hands over his ankles.  His hair is curly or flame-like.  This
may be another representation of Orc, as the personification of
underground forces of revolution now enclosed but with the
potential to break out.  A reticulated worm, with six loops,
fills the lower margin.  The loops suggest (although they do not
quite form) a spiral.</illusobjdesc>

up the left margin.  It bears two large leaves and a long branch

a vine that forms a long, vertical spiral.  There are a few small
plants and tufts of grass right of the nude male and left and

extended wings; three of these seem to be soaring upwards.  Upper
left, a nude, muscular male also seems to be ascending.  He has
apparently broken free of the chains that still dangle from his
wrists.  His right arm is at his side; his left arm is bent back
over his left shoulder.  His left leg is bent behind him; we see
only the left ankle and foot.  His hair may be curly.  He faces
forward with head tilted up.  This may be another representation of Orc or,
more generally, humanity freed from its chains by revolution. 
The words of the heading are integrated into vegetative design
motifs, including several vines with leaves, spiraling vines
growing from the first and last letters of &quot;PROPHECY&quot; (line 2), and grain
stems and tassels growing from the first word of the heading

smoke.  In the lower left corner of the plate is a nude family group

          <illusobjdesc id="d0e2775">Although the plate contains considerable text, it
would appear that the pictorial image is treated as a full-plate
design.  At top right, just below line 1, is a
winged dragon of a type traditionally called a wyvern.  The
creature is apparently flying through the air.  It faces to the
left, with a coiled or spiral tail with one loop on the right. 
Its skin looks scaly and its face is somewhat dog-like, with a
partly opened mouth and large teeth.  The top of its head bears a
crest.  Its front paws look almost like human hands.  Below and
to the left of its left paw is a jagged line, perhaps
representing a bolt of lightning.  Further to the left, and
descending into the left margin, is an old man.  His gown forms a
long, snake-like tail behind him, rather like the wyvern's tail. 
He has a long beard and long hair.  His right arm is at his side,
but we can see that, with his right hand, he grasps a large book
or tablet.  His left arm reaches downward and he holds in his
left hand a scepter or spear with a fleur-de-lis point.  This
figure may be Albion's Angel or Urizen (twice referred to in the
text) with his book of laws.  Below this descending figure is
another jagged line, perhaps representing lightning, and several
cloud outlines extending to the right margin above the last two lines
of text.  Below these billowing clouds, in the plate's lower
margin, is a landscape that includes three figures, probably a
family group of father, mother, and child.  Lower left is the
trunk of a large tree, fallen on the ground to the left.  On the
right, behind the figure group, is another fallen tree with a branch extending upward to the right margin.  The
male is the left-most figure in the group, lower right.  He is
nude and squats or kneels on the ground, with his upper body bent
forward.  Both arms are raised and bent at the elbows; he grasps
his head with both hands.  This gesture, and his crude facial
features, express despair or terror.  To the right is a crouching
female.  She may be gowned or nude.  Her left knee and foot are
prominent.  She turns her head to the right; we cannot see her
face because it is covered by the head of a child of uncertain
gender she embraces.  This child is standing and may be gowned,
although we can see little of this figure beyond the left side of
his or her head and the left leg.  These two figures seem to be
seeking protection in each other's arms.</illusobjdesc>

          <illusobjdesc id="d0e3165">Although containing considerable text, the plate is
treated as a full-plate design with six nude and muscular male
figures.  Top left is a man hovering horizontally in the air in
front of a cloud.  His left leg extends back and up behind him;
his left arm extends out to the right and he points in that
direction with his left index finger.  In his right hand he holds
large scales (or, more precisely, a pair of balances), perhaps to
be associated with the Day of Judgement.  This figure may be a
personification of Justice.  He has long hair and looks up and to
the right at the pair of figures to his right.  The lower man in
this pair seems to be standing, with one leg bent and one
extended, on the outline of the cloud.  He is bent over, with his
face hidden.  His hair is curly.  With both arms bent at the
elbows and extended over his head he carries on his back another
nude male.  This figure, in an extremely contracted posture, has
his arms clasped behind his back, both legs drawn up, and his
head and upper body bent over so that his head seems to touch his
groin or left thigh.  Perhaps we are to think that the man
holding this figure is about to cast him into the abyss.  Further
to the right, but still above the text area, is another nude
figure with long hair that forms loops.  In spite of this
feature, the musculature suggests a male.  We see him from
behind, floating vertically in the air, with legs slightly
spread.  His left arm is raised, his right is lowered, but he
grasps with both hands a giant sword with flames emanating from
its edge and trailing off to the right, as though blown by a
wind.  The arm position suggests that he may be sheathing the
sword, although no sheath is clearly pictured.  This figure,
perhaps another personification of Justice, looks to the right. 
Below the text are large tongues of flame, perhaps suggesting
hell.  Just above these fires are two more nude males.  The
figure on the left hovers horizontally in the air, although he
may be falling into the flames below.  His hair is curly.  His
knees are drawn up toward his torso and he grasps the back of his
head with both hands and faces down.  This gesture suggests
despair.  To the right is a male falling head-first.  His knees
are sharply bent and he too seems to grasp his head with both
hands.  Around him circles a giant snake, with open mouth and a
forked tongue.  Below the human figure, the snake's tail forms a
spiral into which the man may be falling.  The skin of the snake
is scaly.</illusobjdesc>

perhaps flowers decorates the right side of the mound and
descends into the right margin of the text.  There may also be a
few tufts of grass on the far right side of the mound.  On the
left is a skull, facing skyward.  This motif suggests that the

          <illusobjdesc id="d0e4001">Although the plate contains seven lines of text, the
pictorial image is treated as a full-plate design.  The landscape
below the text includes, on the left, a large tree, perhaps a
birch or willow, growing up the left margin.  Its long, slender
branches and leaves (or perhaps catkins) arch over the text. 
Three birds, two with long, forked tails, are perched on the
branches.  One other bird flies in the air, plus a winged insect
(perhaps a moth or butterfly).  The landscape below includes
grass and two large leaves.  The leaf on the left, near the tree,
has a vine-like stem; this may be a grape vine.  The leaf in the
lower right corner might be either a grape or oak leaf.  Lying on
the grass is a ram, facing right, apparently asleep.  A young boy
or male child rests his arms and head on the ram's back; his feet

is probably also sleeping.  Below the ram, another youth, but of
uncertain gender, is stretched on the grass, perhaps asleep.  We
see this nude figure from behind.  The figure's left leg is
extended, the right bent at the knee.  The figure's head lies on
his or her right arm; we see only the top of the figure's head
and long hair.  This gentle, pastoral scene contrasts sharply

the right knee and foot are prominent.  His left leg is not

          <illusobjdesc id="d0e4994">Although the plate contains considerable text, the
pictorial image is treated as a full page design.  Given the
presence of stars and a crescent moon, this is a night scene. 
The sky is filled with clouds and the text panel is also shaped
like a cloud.  High in the sky, but below lines 1-4, a giant swan flies on extended wings to the right.  A
youthful nude male rides on his back.  The figure's legs are
spread apart and dangle on each side of the swan's back just in
front of its wings.  The youth's hair, blown to the left by the onward flight of the bird, may be curly.  He looks
back to the left, away from the direction of flight, and braces
himself with his right arm.  His left arm is raised horizontally
and he holds in his left hand a rein attached to the swan's beak. 
This figure has sometimes been identified as Boston's Angel,
although the reason for this may be nothing more than the fact
that he is named in the text immediately above the figure.  To
the right of the swan are four much smaller birds, all flying on
extended wings.  The largest of these has a forked tail.  Below,
and to the left of the text panel, are seven stars; these may be
a constellation, the Pleiades.  Below the text, but still in the
night sky, are two more flying birds and, on the right, the
crescent moon and a single star (or perhaps the planet Venus). 
The earth appears only along the lower margin; on the far right
are a few spiky lines indicating vegetation.  Three nude children ride
on the back of a snake.  The front-most child, perhaps a girl
with long hair, holds a pair of reins in her left hand that
extends to the snake's open mouth.  Its forked tongue is
prominent.  The second child, further to the left, appears to be
a male.  He braces himself with his left arm, perhaps holding on
to the snake with his left hand, and reaches back with his right
arm to hold hands with the very young child or infant nearest the
snake's tail.  This child reaches up, perhaps with both hands,
but faces to the right and may be looking down.  The right-most
child has her legs together; the others have their legs spread on
each side of the snake (although we see only their right legs). 
The snake's body forms a loop left of the children and terminates
in two more loops.</illusobjdesc>

on a crutch held in his left hand and propped beneath his left

the ground to the right.  The tree apparently continues behind
the tomb and then grows above it, where we see more of the trunk,
one large, leafless branch that arches over the text, and the

          <illusobjdesc id="d0e5845">Although the plate contains considerable text, the
pictorial image is treated as a full-page design showing the
surface and bottom of the sea.  Above the text, the limp body of
a nude female lies supine on a stony shore, with her legs on the
right extending into the waves of the sea.  Her head is bent back
and her long hair descends below, as does her dangling right arm. 
She is probably dead, perhaps from drowning.  A plant with spiky leaves and a vine grow left of the woman's head.  A large bird, very
probably an eagle, is perched on her right upper leg.  The
eagle's wings are extended and his curved beak seems to be thrust
into the woman's abdomen.  The bird may be eating the corpse;
indeed, a triangular form below his beak may be a piece of her
flesh.  The sky behind the bird is filled with clouds; the sea on
the right (perhaps the Atlantic, named several times in the text)
is stormy.  Below the text we see the dark waters of the deep and
the bottom of the sea.  Upon it lies supine a nude male, with his
knees bent slightly and his left arm at his side.  His body is
emaciated and rigid; he is no doubt dead, probably from drowning. 
We can see his ribs and his fingers look skeletal, perhaps
because the sea creatures around him have been eating his flesh. 
These include one large fish and two small ones, all with their
mouths open.  A sea snake coils itself around the man's legs;
another snake hovers above his chest.  Five much smaller fish
appear immediately below the text and in the right margin
following lines 17-18.  Below the man, on the
floor of the sea, are two further sea snakes or worms.  Near the lower right corner is a large,
spiral shell, probably a whelk (common to the Atlantic).  In the
far lower right corner is a minimally-representational form that
may be another shell.  Vegetation rises in the left margin of the
text almost touching the female figure on the rocky shore.  This
vegetation may be seaweed.  The twisted lines include, left of
lines 5-8 of the text, a snake with
open mouth.</illusobjdesc>

sibyl or priestess.  Between her legs is a coiled snake, with its
head also directed at the second figure.  The snake's mouth is
open and its forked tongue is prominent.  To the left is a young
male with curly hair.  He wears either a short gown or tights. 
He is seated on the ground, with his legs extended to the left

          <illusobjdesc id="d0e7447">The text includes, between its lines and in the
right margin, a great many interlinear motifs.  Most of these
take the form of vines or other vegetation; only the most
significant of these will be recorded here.  Above the second
word (&quot;Albions&quot;) in line l, a bird flies upward on extended
wings.  The first letter of the first word in line 2 grows into a
vine, perhaps with leaves.  Line 3 is preceded by a
horse running or leaping to the left.  Following &quot;Bristols&quot; (line 3) are
the following, reading left to right: a vine with a standing
figure facing left, perhaps looking at a very small figure
looking right with arms raised horizontally; a vine with a seated
figure facing right; a flock of birds; a vine with perhaps a dog
standing on it, facing left (and barking at the birds?); a vine
with a standing figure facing left with at least one arm raised
horizontally; a small bird and a large bird (an eagle?) flying
upward; a tree trunk with one bare branch; a figure striding to
the left, at least one arm raised vertically, holding something
(perhaps a child?) in his or her raised hand.  Two birds fly on extended wings above &quot;And cast&quot; in line 7.  Following the word
&quot;mail&quot; (line 6) is another series of very small motifs.  These are,
from left to right: a leafless tree; a minimally representational
form that may be a figure sitting on the ground with one arm
propping up the upper body; two figures facing each other,
perhaps coming together to embrace or to fight; a vine with one
leaf; a vine with two loops and one leaf; a vine-like form with a
figure above it, striding and facing to the left with at least
one arm raised horizontally; a vine bearing, and arching over, a
figure lying on it and facing left.  Following line 8 is a vine,
growing from the second letter of &quot;chattering&quot; in line 9,
and a hovering figure, with legs spread, facing to the left and
holding to his or her mouth (and thus playing?) a trumpet or horn
of some sort.  A vine with two loops extends to the left from the
first letter of &quot;hills&quot; (line 12).  At the end of this line, a
twisting vine appears above the final word (&quot;sky&quot;).  A tassel of
grain grows from the final letter of &quot;sky.&quot;  Between lines 12 and
13 are several motifs.  From left to right these are a vine with
two loops growing from the first letter of &quot;The&quot; at the beginning
of line 13; a very small figure striding to the right, with at
least one arm raised horizontally, on top of the first letter of
the first word in line 13; two vines, one with two loops; a small
bird flying; a seated human figure with knees bent, at least one
arm raised horizontally, and facing to the left; a vine with
leaves growing from the &quot;d&quot; of &quot;winds&quot; in line 13; a vine or
grain tassel growing from the first letter of &quot;driven&quot; in line
13; and a bird flying on extended wings above &quot;flames&quot; in line
13.  A vine, with flowers or leaves, descends from the last
letter of &quot;scales&quot; (line 21).  Birds fly on extended
wing above &quot;spirits&quot; and &quot;dead pining&quot; (line 25). 
Above &quot;bonds of&quot; in the same line, a stag runs or leaps to the
left.  A bird--or perhaps a moth--flies at the end of the
line.  A vine-like form with one loop connects the last letters of lines 24 and 28.</illusobjdesc>

          <illusobjdesc id="d0e8284">A giant figure, wearing a gown and probably female,
crouches on the ground in an extremely contracted posture.  Her
legs are bent under her body and her upper body is bent forward
at a sharp angle over her legs.  She faces right but her head faces down; her face is
covered by her right arm, bent at the elbow with the upper arm
raised.  Apparently, her hands are together in an attitude of
prayer or supplication.  Her long hair cascades below her right
elbow and down the right margin of the text, perhaps transformed
into a waterfall.  Despair and crying are suggested by the
figure; perhaps we are to think of the waterfall as her tears. 
The figure has been variously identified as a personification of
Earth (given the presence of other figures on her body) and even
as Urizen, in spite of the apparent gender.  Seven figures stand
or sit on the giant's body.  On her head is a seated figure,
facing right and holding (and apparently reading) a book or
tablet.  On her back are two figures, one standing and facing
right.  This apparently gowned figure holds a book or tablet in
her or his right hand.  Just to the right is a kneeling figure,
with one leg extended back, and the right arm raised at 135
degrees.  This figure may be looking up and supplicating or
praying.  Below these two figures, and standing on the giant
figure's right upper thigh, is a tree with three branches (but no
leaves).  Standing and leaning against this tree is a (probably
male) figure facing to the right.  He wears a broad-brimmed hat
and holds and plays a pipe.  Further down the giant's thigh are a
few forms that may be sheep lying (and sleeping?) on her body. 
Thus, the piper is probably a shepherd.  Below the piper, a very
small figure lies on the giant's calf, facing right.  This too
may be a shepherd, given the presence of a few forms to the right
that may be lying (and sleeping?) sheep.  Just to the left of the
giant's right foot is an embracing couple.  The figure most
likely to be the female in this group is seated with at least one
leg bent at the knee, head facing down, and left arm raised
horizontally to embrace her companion.  The man kneels on the
ground, facing right, with his right arm extended at 45 degrees
to touch the woman's left thigh.  To the right of this couple,
and standing on the ground just beneath the giant's lower leg, a
stag runs or leaps to the right.  The left portion of this design
above the text is a forest of at least four leafless trees. 
Their trunks have anthropomorphic forms.  We can also see some of
their roots near the left margin; one such root extends left of the
first nine lines of text in the left margin.  The ground near the right margin apparently descends over a cliff.</illusobjdesc>
