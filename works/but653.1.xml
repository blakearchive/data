                    <p>Blake included this tempera painting in his 1809 exhibition, number III in
                        the accompanying [*Descriptive
                        Catalogue*](http://www.blakearchive.org/copy/bb32.d?descId=bb32.d.te.11),
                        and in the 1812 exhibition of the Associated Painters in Water Colors,
                        number 254 in the accompanying *Catalogue of the Fifth Annual Exhibition by
                        the Associated Painters in Water Colors*. [Blake's
                        engraving](http://www.blakearchive.org/work/esxvi) of the design is dated October 8, 1810, in the imprint. The painting is similar in size and panoramic format
                        to Butlin 811, [*The Characters in Spenser's "Faerie
                        Queene"*](http://www.blakearchive.org/preview/but811). Although probably
                        executed years later, *The Characters in Spenser's "Faerie Queene"* may have
                        been created as a pendant to the Chaucer design.</p>

                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc> The painting depicts the thirty pilgrims departing Canterbury on
                        horseback, eight bystanders and several other animals in the foreground, and
                        a sprawling landscape view of the English countryside in the background. The
                        last rider in the procession at the far left, the Reeve, has short hair and
                        may be frowning. His right arm is at his side, bent, and rests on his lap.
                        The second pilgrim from the left, Chaucer, faces forward and right, looking downward. He wears
                        a head covering that falls just past his shoulders and appears to be made of
                        a light textile. He wears a red gown with lace detailing and shoes with a
                        low, flat heel and prominent spurs. He rides a dark horse who holds its left
                        front leg up at a right angle with the ground. In his left hand, which is
                        gloved, Chaucer holds the horse’s reins and perhaps the glove missing from
                        his right hand; in his right hand, he holds a string of beads, perhaps rosary beads. A
                        circular pillow or blanket is rolled up behind his back. The third pilgrim
                        from the left, the Clerk of Oxenford, has long hair that is visible beneath a square
                        hat similar to a mortarboard. Wide-eyed, he stares directly forward and to the right. He has sparse dark facial hair in a small goatee and possibly a
                        mustache. The fourth pilgrim from the left, the Cook, rides in the
                        background so that only his upper torso, head, and raised hands are visible.
                        He tilts back his head to drink from the frothy beverage, perhaps a beer,
                        that he raises to his lips with his left hand. He wears a white cloth head
                        covering that is tied with a red ribbon above his forehead, and no hair is
                        visible beneath the hat. His mouth is open. The fifth pilgrim from the left,
                        the Miller, is one of the few pilgrims shown with noticeably darker skin. He
                        turns to face forward. His hair is short and curly, and he has a beard and
                        mustache. With his raised right hand, he holds a horn or pipe to his lips,
                        and the shaft appears to extend both downward in front of him and rises
                        again into a horn behind his left shoulder. This may be a bagpipe or a uilleann pipe. He wears
                        a collared shirt or coat clasped below his neck with a single button. The
                        sixth pilgrim from the left, the Wife of Bath, rides sidesaddle with her
                        whole body facing forward with knees bent and spread. She turns to look
                        slightly right. She wears several layers of coverings and hats, including a
                        knitted hair net that covers her hair (although some curls may escape at the
                        sides) and two elaborate hoods, one of which bends forward to touch the
                        crown of her forehead. A pointed triangle stands erect on the outermost
                        collar or hat and may indicate a hood. She smiles with her mouth closed. She
                        wears earrings and three strands of pearls; the middle strand supports a
                        cross and the longest strand has a heart-shaped ornament in the middle. Her
                        breasts, with visible nipples, swell out of her gown. The garment also
                        includes a spiky collar. She wears gloves and stockings cover her legs. A
                        heavily patterned blanket with fringe is visible over her lap. She wears
                        heels, and her right shoe includes a prominent spiked spur. Her right arm is
                        bent at a right angle and in her right hand, she holds a stemmed glass filled with a dark liquid,
                        perhaps wine. The horse’s reins, which are decorated with small bells,
                        dangle over her left hand. The seventh rider
                        from the left, the Merchant, faces forward and turns his head slightly left,
                        as if to look toward the Wife of Bath. He wears a hat and appears to have
                        short hair with a beard. The eighth pilgrim from the left, the Parson, faces
                        right and rides forward. His hair and beard are long, and he wears a hat,
                        gown, and laced shoes. Based on the color of his hair, he is likely old. The
                        ninth pilgrim from the left, the Man of Law, sits facing right but tilts his
                        shoulders and head to face the viewer in three-quarter view. He has short
                        hair, a mustache, and a beard and wears a triangular hat with two distinct
                        layers. Two tassels dangle from his hat behind his head. The tenth pilgrim
                        from the left, the Plowman, rides to and faces to the right. His skin
                        appears to be tanned. He wears a woven hat with a wide, loose brim over
                        medium-length hair. He wears a simple shirt with a single button and
                        possibly a tie in the center. Two veins protrude prominently on the right
                        side of his neck. The Plowman rides a light-colored horse that appears haggard
                        from overwork. The eleventh rider from the left, the Physician, faces right
                        and forward. He is the leftmost figure in a closely spaced group of four
                        pilgrims. He has a mustache and beard. He wears a fur-trimmed cylindrical
                        hat that covers his ears. His overcoat also has fur trim and his shirt
                        underneath has a collar. The twelfth rider from the left, the Franklin, is
                        also the second figure from the left in a closely spaced group of four
                        pilgrims. The Franklin’s hair appears to be short and he has a large beard
                        and a mustache. He wears a hat with a dark, rounded top with a large jewel
                        in the front topped by two white curved feathers. His left arm is bent
                        upward, and he holds the reins in a gloved hand in front of his chest. The
                        thirteenth and fourteenth riders from the left are the two citizens. Both
                        citizens wear identical hats that have rounded tops and upturned brims with
                        a large semi-circular opening in the front middle; each wears a shirt with a
                        high collar. They both have beards and mustaches. The fifteenth figure from
                        the left, the Shipman, is one of the only figures who twists his body nearly
                        180 degrees to look behind him, to the left. The Shipman's complexion is
                        darker and he appears to frown. He rests his left hand on the rump of his
                        horse and leans to the left. The sixteenth pilgrim from the left, the Host
                        (named Harry Bailey in the poem), commands attention due to his central
                        placement, hefty size, and grandiose gesture. He twists his torso to face
                        forward and raises his arms horizontally with slightly bent elbows in a
                        cruciform posture. The seventeenth pilgrim from the left, the Summoner or
                        "Sompnour," turns his torso to face the viewer (and the Pardoner) in
                        three-quarter view. His complexion is dark and he has a thin beard around
                        his jaw. He wears what appears to be a floral wreath or garland on his head,
                        which obscures his hair. He has a thicker cloth or fur trim collar on his
                        coat. Only visible above the shoulders, the Manciple, is the eighteenth
                        pilgrim from the left, and he rides in the background of the composition. He
                        turns his neck sharply to look to the right and slightly behind him, and he
                        tilts his chin and gazes up. His hair is short and he has a beard. He wears
                        a small, circular hat; at least two feathers rise from the back of the hat,
                        though one is partially obscured. The collar of the Manciple's shirt is
                        barely visible behind the Summoner. The nineteenth figure from the left, the
                        Pardoner, rides to the right in the foreground but twists his torso to the
                        left so that his face is rendered in a left profile. He may look toward the
                        Host behind him. He has long hair and wears a hat with a dark band around
                        the base and a long trailing hood that falls over his right shoulder. His
                        gown is unadorned except for the large decorative red cross that covers the
                        entire backside of the garment. A bag is slung by a strap across his back and rests on top of his right thigh. Like his gown, the bag is decorated
                        with a red cross. The eleventh pilgrim from the right side of the
                        composition, the Monk, stares directly ahead to the right. The majority of
                        his body is obscured by the Pardoner’s horse, but his head, with tonsured
                        curly hair, is visible. Like the Friar beside him, the Monk wears a dark
                        habit with a circular hood that stands stiff against his back. The tenth
                        pilgrim from the right, the Friar, turns to look toward the monk at whom he
                        points with his left hand. His hair is also tonsured and he wears a circular
                        hood that stands stiffly behind his head and neck. The ninth rider from the
                        right, a male citizen, rides facing right behind the Monk and Friar. Only
                        his head and shoulders are visible. He wears a hat with upturned side brims
                        and has medium-length, shaggy hair as well as a beard and mustache. The
                        eighth pilgrim from the right, the Lady Abbess, faces forward and right
                        while riding sidesaddle with her legs on the left side of her horse. In her
                        left hand she holds her horse’s reins and with her right grasps the shaft of
                        a long, thin riding crop, which dangles to the right of her horse. Rosary
                        beads fastened with a ribbon tied into two bows, a circular medallion, and a cross dangle from her right wrist. The
                        Lady Abbess’ horse has a vibrantly flowing mane and it picks up its left
                        front and back right hoofs. Its body is draped with a net or veil-like
                        covering. Two greyhounds proceed below the Lady Abbess, their stances imitating those of the procession’s horses. The seventh pilgrim from the right, the Nun, rides
                        to the left of the Lady Abbess and turns her head to the right to look
                        directly out at the viewer. She has a round face with thick curly hair, and
                        her neck is completely covered by a white wimple. Like the Lady Abbess, she
                        wears a black veil. She has her right arm raised, bent at the elbow, with
                        her gloved hand extended. The group of three priests constitute the fourth,
                        fifth, and sixth riders from the right side of the composition. The leftmost
                        of the group is shown in a three-quarter view and gazes upward with an
                        entranced or contemplative expression. The raised circular hood of his habit
                        emphasizes his round head, and his habit appears clasped by a row of buttons
                        down the middle of his chest. He has short, curly hair and a youthful
                        appearance. The middle priest has his face turned towards the Squire's
                        Yeoman. He has dark hair and a beard, while his hood might be decorated with
                        a braid. Only the head and hood of the rightmost priest are
                        viewable. His eyes are closed and his hood
                        might be hiding his hair. The third pilgrim from the right, the Squire’s
                        Yeoman, faces right but turns his head to look out at the viewer, tilting
                        his head slightly back. His complexion is darker than the majority of the
                        pilgrims. He has dark, curly hair, viewable from what may be a hood or part
                        of chain mail that is clasped at the front by a large brooch or gem. In his
                        right hand he holds a large bow that extends upward in a serpentine curve
                        far above his head. The feathered tail of at least one arrow is visible in
                        the crook of his right arm. The second pilgrim from the right, the Knight,
                        rides in the foreground and twists his torso to the right so that his chest
                        faces the viewer. The chain mail encircling his head and neck connects to a
                        breastplate that comes to a point below his sternum below which another
                        layer of chain mail extends over his hips and down his arms. A necklace or
                        sash adorned with a cross is visible in front of his upper chest; another
                        decorated sash crosses his torso diagonally down to his left hip. A large
                        black dog walks to the right below the Knight's horse. The first pilgrim
                        leading the party forward on the right side of the composition, the Squire,
                        sits taller than most of his companions (with the added height of his hat’s
                        plumes) and turns his shoulders to the right to toward the viewer. He has
                        short curly hair and wears a collar, perhaps made of lace, and a decorated
                        overcoat that is clasped in the middle of his chest with a single button.
                        The Squire's horse is the most active of the animals in the procession,
                        raising both of its front legs off the ground in a dramatic gallop forward.
                        The animal turns its head to the right to look directly at the viewer with
                        wide, dark eyes and dramatically flared nostrils. A group of six figures—one
                        adult male, one adult female holding an infant, and three standing children
                        that collectively may represent a family group—gather together in the lower
                        left corner of the engraving. In addition to the family group at far left,
                        there are two other figures in the foreground who are not part of the main
                        procession of pilgrims. The leftmost of these (below and to the right of
                        Chaucer and his horse) walks right and faces away, looking up toward the
                        pilgrims. The figure, likely female, wears a long, simple
                        sleeveless gown, revealing a muscular right arm. The figure carries a jar
                        or pouch, either a water bladder or a shepherd's purse.                   
                        The rightmost figure (below the Franklin) stands facing left in a
                        contrapposto stance. His stiff collar is wide and exposes his chest while
                        his sleeves are ruffed at the shoulders and hem. He carries a pitcher in his
                        left hand and keg or barrel on the right. The largest architectural
                        component of the composition is the Tabard Inn at far left. The pilgrims
                        emerge from a wide portal door topped with a pointed arch supported with
                        columns presumably on both sides, though only the leftmost is visible. The
                        gable and both spandrels above the portal contain legible text identifying
                        both the building and the subject of the overall engraving. The facade is decorated
                        with many elements characteristic of Gothic cathedrals as well as sculpted
                        figures. The one most visible, on the left side of the façade, may be the sculpture of a bishop, holding a staff or shepherd's crook. The
                        two wooden beams that form the roof of the portal are decorated with
                        scalloped eaves. The rectangular divisions below and to the left of the
                        building’s peak contain four windows. A portion of the Tabard Inn's interior
                        is visible through the open portal and is decorated with wide arched windows
                        separated by columns, with the central column being topped with a sculpted
                        figure with folded arms. In addition to the large Tabard Inn at left,
                        several other structures are visible throughout the background of the
                        composition. Many buildings, many of which have spires and arches, are
                        visible behind a hedge and to the right of the portal through which the
                        pilgrims walk at left. A crenelated wall stands in front of the city, which
                        may represent London, the pilgrims' city of origin. Additional structures
                        that may be houses, barns, and distant cities are visible throughout the
                        background landscape. Four black birds and two white birds fly in the sky
                        near the upper left corner of the composition while three additional white
                        birds, possibly doves, sit on the right side of the roof of the Tabard Inn.
                        Several groups of tiny figures populate the landscape that extends behind
                        the main riders. The ground beneath the pilgrims along the lower edge of the
                        composition may be a road or path and appears to be composed of packed earth
                        with many small stones. The horse's hoofs kick up columns of dust. Behind
                        the procession of pilgrims, rolling hills covered in grass extend to the
                        horizon. A row of leafy trees or hedges is visible in the middleground while
                        additional areas of leafy, though indeterminate, vegetation can be seen
                        throughout the composition. Clouds and one star are visible in the left part
                        of the sky. Diagonal beams of light or radiance extend from the lower right
                        corner of the sky, perhaps suggesting a rising sun in the east as the
                        pilgrims depart in the morning.</illusobjdesc>

                            has short hair and closed lips that is likely frowning. He looks forward
                            following the procession of pilgrims to the right. He wears a vertically
                            striped garment with a prominent cylindrical collar, which may
                            alternatively be a hood. His right arm is at his side, bent, and rests
                            on his lap. He is framed by the architectural portal in a Gothic style.
                            His saddle is visible, though most of his horse's body is
                            obscured.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>The second pilgrim from the left, Chaucer, faces forward and
                            right. He wears a head covering and has a beard. He wears a gown with
                            lace detailing on the collar, bottom hem, and edges of the sleeves. He
                            wears stockings and shoes with a low, flat heel and prominent spurs. He
                            rides a dark horse who holds its left front leg up at a right angle with
                            the ground. In his left hand, which is gloved and bent upward, Chaucer
                            holds the horse’s reins and perhaps the glove missing from his right
                            hand. His right arm is bent and rests in his lap; in his right hand, he
                            holds a string of beads, perhaps rosary beads. A circular pillow or

                        <illusobjdesc>The sixteenth pilgrim from the left, the Host (named Harry
                            Bailey in the poem), commands attention due to his central placement,
                            hefty size, and grandiose gesture. He twists his torso to face forward
                            and raises his arms horizontally with slightly bent elbows in a
                            cruciform posture. His palms face forward. He wears a hat similar to the
                            Franklin’s that is round with a large central jewel with two tall
                            feathers. His hair, visible beneath his hat, is short and curly. His
                            long-sleeved garment is incredibly tight, highlighting his portliness,
                            especially in his midsection. He wears a wide ruffled collar. At least
                            four clasps and a belt, from which a sword or dagger hangs, hold the
                            garment together as he reclines against a rolled blanket or cylindrical
                            pillow similar to the one used by Chaucer. A riding boot with a
                            prominent spur rises up to his right knee. In his right hand, the Host
                            brandishes a lengthy whip or riding crop; in his left, he grasps his
                            horse’s reins between his thumb and palm.</illusobjdesc>

                            thin beard. He wears what appears to be a floral wreath or garland on
                            his head, which obscures his hair. A similar garland-like accoutrement
                            hangs low around his neck, although this may also be fur trim on his
                            coat. His right arm is bent in a right angle at the elbow and he reaches
                            toward the body of the Pardoner. His fingers extend and disappear behind
                            the Pardoner’s waist. In this hand, he may also hold a shepherd's
                            crook.</illusobjdesc>

                            has a beard. He wears a small, circular hat; at least two feathers rise
                            from the back of the hat, though one is partially obscured. The collar

                            and a long trailing hood that falls over his right shoulder. His gown is

                            right hand. A loose bag also decorated with a cross is worn over his
                            left shoulder, and a belt circles his waist. His gown falls in folds
                            above his right foot, on which he wears a shoe with an upward curving
                            pointed toe, small heel, and prominent spur. His right leg is

                            is light-colored at top and dark below. Her arms are bent and at her
                            sides, and she wears minimally decorated gloves. In her left hand she
                            holds her horse’s reins and with her right grasps the shaft of a long,
                            thin riding crop, which dangles to the right of her horse. Rosary beads
                            fastened with a ribbon tied into two bows, a circular medallion that may be inscribed, and another cross dangle from her right

                            slightly to the right in a serpentine curve. Echoing the femininity of
                            its rider, the horse has wide, glistening eyes and noticeable thick
                            eyelashes. Its mouth appears to be open and it picks up its left front
                            and back right hoofs. The Lady Abbess rides in a dark saddle over at
                            least two decorated pads or blankets. Her horse’s body is draped with a
                            net or veil-like covering, and its reins are also draped with additional
                            ornate material.</illusobjdesc>

                            the belly of the horse and looking with head up toward the Lady Abbess.
                            Present in Chaucer’s original texts, these dogs also link the Lady

                            has a round face with thick curly hair. Her neck is completely covered
                            by a white wimple that is also slightly visible near the crown of her
                            head. Like the Lady Abbess, she wears a black veil, which also covers
                            her shoulders and clasps with a button in the middle of her chest. The
                            portion of her torso that is visible is clothed in a lighter-colored
                            garment, and a long, decorated glove covers her right hand, with which

                            may be made of chain mail, on his right hand with which he holds a large
                            bow that extends upward in a serpentine curve far above his head. The
                            feathered tail of at least one arrow is visible in the crook of his
                            right arm.</illusobjdesc>

                            foreground and twists his torso to the right so that his chest faces the
                            viewer. He turns his head even further right to look behind him at left.
                            He wears chain mail on his head but his hair and beard are still
                            partially visible. The chain mail encircling his head and neck connects
                            to a breastplate that comes to a point below his sternum below which
                            another layer of chain mail extends over his hips and down his arms.
                            Both hands are gloved; with palm open and turned to face the viewer, the
                            Knight gestures to the left with his right hand, and with his left, he
                            grasps his horse’s reins. A scarf is draped around his shoulders, and
                            the right end flutters to the left. A necklace or sash adorned with a
                            cross is visible in front of his upper chest; another decorated sash
                            crosses his torso diagonally down to his left hip. Beside his left hand
                            and below the cross, a design of a horse and rider is visible, which may
                            be another decoration or possibly the hilt of a sword that is tucked in
                            his armor. His right leg is bent and covered in plated armor with
                            intricate designs on the knee and shin plates, and he wears a flat,
                            pointed-toe shoe with a sizable spur.</illusobjdesc>

                            open, and it lifts its front right leg as it walks right. A large gem
                            accents the horse’s bridle below its right ear, which is raised and
                            forward. The harness and saddle are minimally adorned (though there is

                            gallop forward. The animal turns its head to the right to look directly
                            at the viewer with wide, dark eyes and dramatically flared nostrils. The

                            hair pulled back with a comb or accessory. The figure wears a long,

                            bladder of water, bottle, or a shepherd's purse. The figure's left leg
                            is extended as she walks with bare feet to the right.</illusobjdesc>

                            the Parson, the Man of Law, and the Plowman, a second youth stands in
                            contrapposto facing left. This figure is male and wears a particularly
                            detailed outfit that includes a shirt with a plunging neckline, long
                            sleeves ruffed at the shoulders, a prominent stiff collar, and what
                            appears to be fringe or ties of some kind at the shirt's base. He also
                            wears knee-length breeches that are tight around the knee but loose and
                            creased around his thighs. His hair is short and very curly. He stands
                            in contrapposto with his weight on his right hip and leg and the left
                            bent at the knee with only the bare toes of his left foot on the ground.
                            He holds a small pitcher by the handle in his right hand and, in his
                            left, the strap of a wooden barrel, cask, or keg with a visible spout
                            facing up.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>The largest architectural component of the composition is the
                            Tabard Inn at far left. The pilgrims emerge from a wide portal door
                            topped with a pointed arch supported with columns presumably on both
                            sides, though only the leftmost is visible. The gable and both spandrels
                            above the portal contain legible text identifying both the building and
                            the subject of the overall engraving: "THE TABARDE INNE BY HENRY BAILLY"
                            on the left spandrel; "THE LODGYNGE HOUSE FOR PILGRIMS" on the right
                            side of the gable; and "WHO JOURNEY TO SAINT THOMASS SHRINE AT
                            CANTERBURY" on the right spandrel. The facade is decorated with many
                            elements characteristic of Gothic cathedrals, though their placement and
                            order is somewhat unusual. Two wooden beams come together to form the
                            apex of the structure, and these are decorated with scalloped eaves on
                            both sides. Below and to the left of the building's central peak are
                            rectangular blocks containing various architectural elements, including
                            four windows that may contain stained glass panes and tracery, a
                            tabernacle pinnacle containing the sculptural figures, and lancet
                            windows (or perhaps buttresses or niches depending on if the forms are
                            convex, concave, or flat). A portion of the Tabard Inn's interior is
                            visible through the open portal. Like the exterior facade, the inner
                            right wall is decorated with wide arched windows separated by columns,
                            with the central column being topped with a sculpted figure with folded
                            arms. The three clearly visible arches precisely frame the heads of the
                            last three pilgrims in the procession—the Reeve, Chaucer, and the Clerk
                            of Oxenford.</illusobjdesc>

                            the structure on the left side of the plate. The largest of these
                            figures stands inside what appears to be a hexagonal niche of a
                            tabernacle pinnacle on the left side of the main arched portal of the
                            building representing the Tabard Inn. In this engraving, the figure is a
                            Catholic bishop, identified clearly by his mitre, ornately decorated
                            robes, and crosier in his right hand. The bishop's right hand and
                            crosier appear to project out from the architectural niche. The figure's
                            left hand is raised with finger extended, likely in a sign of blessing
                            for the pilgrims below him who are beginning their religious
                            journey.</illusobjdesc>

                            crest of a hill between two clumps of vegetation. Compositionally, these
                            figures are very simple, made only of a few lines. They appear to face
                            away(?) from the procession of pilgrims and instead look out over the
                            vast landscape. The child at left may extend an arm to touch the adult
                            beside him. The figures appear to wear gowns with the possible exception
                            of the middle figure, who may wear pants and perhaps also a broad-rimmed
                            hat. Like the group of six figures in the lower left corner of the
                            engraving, these figures may also represent a family group or community
                            of some kind.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>Several groups of tiny figures populate the landscape that
                            extends behind the main riders. In the distance above the Host's raised
                            left arm, at least one pair of figures stands to the left of a small
                            cottage or house. This pair appears to consist of an adult on the right
                            and a child at left; both may be gowned. The adult figure's arm appears
                            to be raised at left. Above and to the left of this group may stand or
                            walk a second pair of figures on the downward slope of a hill. Their
                            smaller size emphasizes their increased distance from the pilgrims
                            processing in the foreground. The figure on the right in this group may
                            have one arm raised at 45 degrees.</illusobjdesc>

                            Many buildings, many of which have spires and arches, are visible behind
                            a hedge and to the right of the portal through which the pilgrims walk
                            at left. A crenelated wall stands in front of the city, which may
                            represent London, the pilgrims' city of origin. Several other structures
                            that appear to be houses, barns(?), and distant cities with tall spires,
                            are visible throughout the background landscape. At least one home, near
                            the middle of the scene, has a smoking chimney.</illusobjdesc>
