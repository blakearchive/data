                        This work was probably delivered to Butts between the summer of 1803 and May 1805 (Bentley, 
                        *Records*
                        , page 764), but has generally been dated to an earlier period, c. 1800-03, for stylistic reasons; see Butlin 455.</note>

                <illustration location="E" type="plate">
                    <illusobjdesc>This design, based on Judges 16:19, represents the Biblical scene of Delilah cutting Samson's hair to weaken him. In the center of the design is a bare-breasted woman who may wear a skirt or some cloth draped over her legs; this is Delilah. She has long, curly hair and appears to wear an earring in her visible left ear. She sits, twisted, so that her legs face right, her torso faces forward, and her head faces left. Both legs are bent, with her right foot visible and possibly on tiptoe. Her left arm is at her side but bent and she holds a pair of scissors in her left hand. Her right arm is raised at 135 degrees and she points upward with her right hand, fingers spread; presumably, she uses this gesture to summon the soldiers toward whom she looks. Sitting limply and partly reclining, with a nearly bald head resting on Delilah's lap, is the nude and muscular male figure of Samson. He faces away and slightly left. His arms are at his side and his legs are bent underneath him. He is probably sleeping. His right hand rests limply on bedding; both feet are prominent. On the left side of the design stand three armored soldiers, wearing helmets. The two frontmost soldiers have mustaches, bend forward, and face forward and right. Their right feet are prominent; the may be striding forward. The soldier on the left appears to look at Sampson; his companion on the right looks at Delilah. The face of the middle figure is obscured but is probably also facing right. The two soldiers in front carry two shields; the soldier on the right also holds a spear. The knees of the two soldiers in front are covered in scale-like armor or perhaps chainmail. The presence of four speaks behind the soldiers indicate at least three more soldiers that are not pictured. The scene takes place in a room or tent defined primarily by the drapery behind Delilah. Delilah and Samson appear to sit on a couch or bed, which is covered in draping cloth, possibly a sheet.</illusobjdesc>
