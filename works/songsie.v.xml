            The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of electronic editions of two late copies of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi>, Copy V (Pierpont Morgan Library) and Copy Y (Metropolitan Museum), and a manuscript listing the order of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> (Rosenwald Collection, Library of Congress). Both copies are here reproduced for the first time, and, like all the illuminated books in the Archive, their texts and images are fully searchable and are supported by our Inote and ImageSizer applications.<lb/><lb/>
            Blake printed Copy V in 1821 in light orange ink on large sheets of J. Whatman paper watermarked 1818. He and/or possibly his wife, Catherine, drew four lines in pen and ink over or beside pencil lines to form a frame of three bands around each image; washed the frame's wide central band in light pinks, blues, yellows, or greens; and numbered the pages in ink 1-54 just outside the outer framing line. Copy Y, printed in 1825 in bright orange ink on J. Whatman paper watermarked 1825, is framed more decoratively with vines, curtains, and other motifs and is also numbered in pen and ink 1-54.<lb/><lb/>
            Both copies are connected either visually or bibliographically to Copy R, previously published in the Archive (see the update for 14 December 1999). Nearly all of the impressions of Copy R were printed in 1795 along with those making up Copy A (forthcoming in the Archive), and then, by August 1819, were refinished and given four framing lines for Blake's patron, John Linnell. Copy R established the plate order for seven of the eight subsequent copies printed between 1818 and 1827, including Copy Y and Copies Z and AA, both previously published in the Archive. The exception is Copy V, whose plates were uniquely arranged according to a manuscript entitled "The Order in which the Songs of Innocence &amp; Experience ought to be paged &amp; placed," often called "The Order of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>." Our reproduction of this manuscript is the first to be published since William Muir's partial facsimile of 1885, and our transcription and notes provide the most thorough textual and bibliographic treatment of it in any medium.<lb/><lb/>
            As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible through the continuing support of the Library of Congress, the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia, by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and by the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.

The dominant form is perhaps the vegetation with flame-like leaves that swirls in the spaces of the 
right margin (with a more conventional leaf or two at bottom right), underneath the title, and
down the left margin.  Tendrils extending from both margins help separate the stanzas from one
another.  But the vine full of leaves and flowers(?) that extends across the top of the plate above the title
and fills the top right corner and the space right of the first stanza is distinct from the flame-like 
vegetation that dominates the rest of the plate.  Extensions of letters in the title (line 2) contribute to both

combinations of those with other long-leaved plants (especially under the title).  Many of the
letters of the long-lined poem have decorative vine-like extensions.  After the area around the title, the most extravagant decoration is reserved for the spaces between stanzas, where rows of leaves and 
vines (most of them originating in extensions of letters of the text in lines adjacent to the spaces) 
alternate with an occasional bird (below "into the" in line 7) or human figure (beneath "innocent"
in line 11).  Beneath the final stanza is another particularly busy area of decoration, dominated by 
vines and leaves but including a bird perching on a vine, wings outspread, facing the viewer. 
Some of the decorations are suggestive of birds (e.g., above "Seated" in line 9 and above "their" in line
11) or human figures (e.g., on the sprig of vegetation beneath the "Y" of "HOLY" [line 2]) but are more likely

alternate with an occasional bird or human figure.  Beneath the final stanza is another particularly

right corner.  From there the vine climbs up the right margin behind the standing figure and then, 
after arching over the figure's head, onto the flame-like plant, which the vine continues to climb 
until it terminates just left of the title.  A second vine, much shorter, appears in front of the plant
at the bottom of the plate, left of the reclining figure.  There is the suggestion of a vine or other vegetation running up the left margin.  There are several human 
figures on and around the plants: (at top left) a gowned female with long hair walks right; a
second gowned female with long hair floats behind her, pointing right; two figures kneel side by side, 
facing right, hands raised in prayer; (at bottom right) a gowned, haloed, Christ-like figure stands, 
with an arm extended, perhaps touching the left hand of a partly nude(?) male figure to the left, who
reclines with his right arm braced for support, his left raised vertically; below and in front of this pair, a 
third figure, perhaps a gowned female, reclines, supported on her left arm.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="A"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>hovering</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>partly nude</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>walking</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>pitcher</characteristic><characteristic>arm extended</characteristic><characteristic>arm drawn back</characteristic><characteristic>arm at side</characteristic><characteristic>pointing</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised horizontally</characteristic><illusobjdesc>At top left, a woman with long hair walks and looks right; her right arm is drawn back behind her.

Several 
varieties of vegetation fill spaces around the text and between stanzas.  The stanzas are separated by irregular 
vine-like structures that are sometimes extensions of letters (such as the "d" of "round" in 
line 20) or extensions of other vegetation or, sometimes, discrete
bits.  The initial "A" in the title (line 2) sprouts a plant-like structure on the left, while a vine-like 
extension dangles down the left margin.  A vine also runs across the bottom of the plate.  The
vegetation in the upper right margin—beside the "m" of "Dream" in the title—seems to be an arc of tasseled 
grass or grain that curves back over the title.  Beneath it—opposite stanzas 1 and 2—are three or 
four clusters of flame-like leaves or tufts of grass.  Below those are a bit of leafy vine (after line 11) 
and a branch or root of some sort (after line 14).  In the lower right margin—opposite stanzas 4 
and 5—is an odd tree rooted in the strip of ground below.  In front of the 
tree stands a small figure, robed, wearing a hat, and holding a staff—probably the "watchman 
of the night" (line 18), the glow-worm of the text in human form.  He is one of four small and human figures on 
the plate.  The other three are in the area of the title: lying, presumably 
sleeping, on the left stroke of the initial "A" (difficult to distinguish in this copy); sitting, possibly reading, 
in the "D" of "Dream"; and 
floating or flying between bits of vegetation beneath the "e" of "Dream."  The animal life of the
poem appears in similarly tiny and indistinct (or questionable) forms in the margins: there could be an
ant (the "Emmet" of line 5) to the right of line 5; a worm or caterpillar (somewhat hard to discern in this copy) 
nestled in the lower right sprigs of the vegetation right of line 7; and two winged beetles(?) (lines 20-21) flying 
right of lines 6 and 19.  There may be another ant, which merges almost indistinguishably with the vegetation in 
this copy, crawling beneath "her" in line 9.  A bird, perhaps an eagle, unmentioned

apparently a plant with one leaf visible, perhaps an anemone pulsatilla.  To the left of the treetop a

a few of its leafless branches (or perhaps a leafless vine) fill marginal spaces.  Another slender tree trunk defines the left 
edge of the design.  The sky, colored to suggest sunrise or sunset above, darkens toward the
