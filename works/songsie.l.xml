            The editors of the William Blake Archive are pleased to announce the publication of three new electronic editions of Blake's most popular work, <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi>. They are of Copies C, F, and L—none has been reproduced before now.<lb/><lb/><hi rend="i">Songs</hi> Copy C is one of the first copies of the combined <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>. Along with Copies B, D, and E, it was formed in 1794 of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> plates printed in raw sienna on both sides of the leaf in 1789 and <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> plates lightly color printed in yellow ochre in the same format in 1794. By this time, Blake had decided to move Plates 34-36 ("The Little Girl Lost" and "The Little Girl Found") to <hi rend="i">Experience</hi>, but since Plate 34 was printed on the verso of the leaf with Plate 26 ("A Dream"), Plate 26 is read in this copy, as well as in Copies B and D, as an <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> poem. And, like Copies B and D, Copy C is missing Plate 52 ("To Tirzah") but has the small vignette known as plate a (five cherubs carrying a naked figure), one of Blake's earliest relief etchings used here as a tailpiece. Copy C is in the Rosenwald Collection, Library of Congress.<lb/><lb/>
            Bibliographically, Copy F is even more interesting. It, too, consists of two sections printed differently and at different times. Its Innocence plates were printed in green ink on both sides of the leaf in 1789, probably before the raw sienna printing. Its <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> plates were heavily color printed on one side of the leaf in 1794, before those in Copy C, possibly while <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> was still in progress. The impressions of <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> were printed with those now in <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> Copies G, H, and T, which are all missing Plates 39, 44, 45, and 48. Together, these four plates form one sheet of copper. The fact that all four plates are missing from all four copies suggests that the plates were not yet part of <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> at the time of this printing. These four color-printed copies of <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> appear to have been intended as autonomous publications. At any rate, there are no extant sets of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> impressions printed in this style, Copies G and H remain without <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi>, and Copies F and T were assembled by someone other than Blake.<lb/><lb/><hi rend="i">Songs</hi> Copy L, like Copy F, is in the Yale Center for British Art. Unlike Copies C and F, though, its two parts were printed together in a uniform style, dark brown ink on one side of the leaf, ca. 1795. It has all 54 plates, including Plate 52, that make up the combined <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> and is numbered by Blake 1-54.<lb/><lb/>
            All of these editions have newly edited SGML-encoded texts and all are fully searchable for both text and images and supported by the unique Inote and ImageSizer applications described in our previous updates. We now have twenty-nine copies of sixteen illuminated books in the Archive. We will soon be adding two more copies of <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> and an in-depth illustrated Tour highlighting the Archive's features and some ways to use its resources. We will continue to add new electronic editions of illuminated books throughout the spring and summer.

moves 
generally leftward.  Overhead in the branches of two intertwining grape vines that are rooted at
lower right and grow upward along the right margin and left to embrace the stanzas of
the poem, one boy, left, stretches on tiptoe to reach a cluster of grapes on the left while a second
boy, 
right, hands another cluster to a girl who reaches up from the grass below.  Next to her, walking 
left, is a long-haired male in hat and tights or breeches; he holds a bunch of grapes in his
extended left hand.  Next in line, a woman looks down at the infant in her arms.  A small child
stands just to the left.  In the center, the tallest figure in the group, perhaps "Old John with white
hair" (Object 5, line 13), points forward with his right hand.  A boy to the left, who faces away
from the viewer, holds a bat at his side with his left hand.  At the front of the procession are a
boy and girl, both looking back toward the rest of the group.  Between them is a kite that the girl
may be holding.  The green tinting of the ground below the playful procession suggests

grass or grain that curves back over the title.  Beneath it—opposite stanzas 1 and 2—are three or
four clusters of flame-like leaves or tufts of grass.  Below those are a bit of leafy vine (after line
11) and a branch or root of some sort (after line 14).  In the lower right margin—opposite stanzas 4

staff—probably the "watchman of the night" (line 18), the glow-worm of the text in human form. 
He is one of four small human figures on the plate.  The other three are in the area of the title:
lying, presumably 
sleeping, on the left stroke of the initial "A"; sitting, perhaps reading, in the "D" of "Dream"; and
floating or flying, with arms raised horizontally, between bits of vegetation beneath the "e" of
"Dream."  The animal life of the poem appears in similarly tiny forms in the margins: there could
be an ant (the "Emmet" of line 5) to the right of line 5, and another crawling beneath the "her" in line 10;
a worm or caterpillar nestled in the lower right
sprigs of the vegetation right of line 7; and winged beetles(?) (lines 20-21) flying right of

The dominant form is perhaps the vegetation with flame-like leaves that swirls in the spaces of
the 
right margin (with a more conventional leaf or two at bottom right), underneath the title, and
down the left margin.  Tendrils extending from both margins help separate the stanzas from one
another.  The vine right of the final stanza on the plate has several loops suggesting a spiral.  The
vine full of leaves and flowers(?) that extends across the top of the plate above the title and fills
the top right corner and the space right of the first stanza is distinct from the flame-like 
vegetation that dominates the rest of the plate.  Extensions of letters in the title (line 2) contribute to both 
forms of vegetation: the initial "A" and "C" to the vine above, the "S" to both.  In the text of the 
poem, occasional letters have modest decorative extensions, and there are a few bits of stray 
decorative vegetation.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="object" location="E"><characteristic>sky</characteristic><characteristic>sunrise</characteristic><characteristic>sunset</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The background colors on the plate suggest the sky, perhaps at sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc></component></illustration></illusdesc><phystext><texthead justify="left"><l n="songsie.l.illbk.16.01" justify="left" indent="40"><physnumber type="pen-and-ink">16</physnumber></l></texthead><vspace extent="2"/><texthead justify="left"><l n="songsie.l.illbk.16.02" justify="left" indent="5">A CRADLE SONG</l></texthead><vspace extent="1"/><lg type="verse" justify="left"><l n="songsie.l.illbk.16.03" justify="left">Sweet dreams form a shade,</l><l n="songsie.l.illbk.16.04" justify="left">O'er my lovely infants head,</l><l n="songsie.l.illbk.16.05" justify="left">Sweet dreams of pleasant streams,</l><l n="songsie.l.illbk.16.06" justify="left">By happy silent moony beams</l></lg><vspace extent="1"/><lg type="verse" justify="left"><l n="songsie.l.illbk.16.07" justify="left">Sweet sleep with soft down,</l><l n="songsie.l.illbk.16.08" justify="left">Weave thy brows an infant crown.</l><l n="songsie.l.illbk.16.09" justify="left">Sweet sleep Angel mild,</l><l n="songsie.l.illbk.16.10" justify="left">Hover o'er my happy child.</l></lg><vspace extent="1"/><lg type="verse" justify="left"><l n="songsie.l.illbk.16.11" justify="left">Sweet smiles in the night,</l><l n="songsie.l.illbk.16.12" justify="left">Hover over my delight.</l><l n="songsie.l.illbk.16.13" justify="left">Sweet smiles Mothers smiles</l><l n="songsie.l.illbk.16.14" justify="left">All the livelong night beguiles.</l></lg><vspace extent="1"/><lg type="verse" justify="left"><l n="songsie.l.illbk.16.15" justify="left">Sweet moans. dovelike sighs.</l><l n="songsie.l.illbk.16.16" justify="left">Chase not slumber from thy eyes,</l><l n="songsie.l.illbk.16.17" justify="left">Sweet moans. sweeter smiles.</l><l n="songsie.l.illbk.16.18" justify="left">All the dovelike moans beguiles.</l></lg><vspace extent="1"/><lg type="verse" justify="left"><l n="songsie.l.illbk.16.19" justify="left">Sleep sleep happy child.</l><l n="songsie.l.illbk.16.20" justify="left">All creation slept and smil'd.</l><l n="songsie.l.illbk.16.21" justify="left">Sleep sleep, happy sleep.</l><l n="songsie.l.illbk.16.22" justify="left">While o'er thee thy mother weep</l></lg><vspace extent="1"/><lg type="verse" justify="left"><l n="songsie.l.illbk.16.23" justify="left">Sweet babe in thy face.</l><l n="songsie.l.illbk.16.24" justify="left">Holy image I can trace.</l><l n="songsie.l.illbk.16.25" justify="left">Sweet babe once like thee.</l><l n="songsie.l.illbk.16.26" justify="left">Thy maker lay and wept for me</l></lg><vspace extent="1"/><textfoot justify="left"><l n="songsie.l.illbk.16.27" justify="left" indent="35"><catchword>Wept</catchword></l></textfoot></phystext></desc><desc id="songsie.l.illbk.17" dbi="songsie.L.P17"><objtitle>,

a little beyond the point where the tree bends left, is unclear.  Just left of the trees, lower right, a

climbs in the branches above, opposite stanza 7.  There may also be a third figure with arms
raised, appears opposite stanzas 2 and 3, although the figure merges with the tendrils in this copy.  A
