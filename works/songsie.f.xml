            The editors of the William Blake Archive are pleased to announce the publication of three new electronic editions of Blake's most popular work, <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi>. They are of Copies C, F, and L—none has been reproduced before now.<lb/><lb/><hi rend="i">Songs</hi> Copy C is one of the first copies of the combined <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>. Along with Copies B, D, and E, it was formed in 1794 of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> plates printed in raw sienna on both sides of the leaf in 1789 and <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> plates lightly color printed in yellow ochre in the same format in 1794. By this time, Blake had decided to move plates 34-36 ("The Little Girl Lost" and "The Little Girl Found") to <hi rend="i">Experience</hi>, but since plate 34 was printed on the verso of the leaf with plate 26 ("A Dream"), plate 26 is read in this copy, as well as in Copies B and D, as an <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> poem. And, like Copies B and D, Copy C is missing plate 52 ("To Tirzah") but has the small vignette known as plate a (five cherubs carrying a naked figure), one of Blake's earliest relief etchings used here as a tailpiece. Copy C is in the Rosenwald Collection, Library of Congress.<lb/><lb/>
            Bibliographically, Copy F is even more interesting. It, too, consists of two sections printed differently and at different times. Its Innocence plates were printed in green ink on both sides of the leaf in 1789, probably before the raw sienna printing. Its <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> plates were heavily color printed on one side of the leaf in 1794, before those in Copy C, possibly while <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> was still in progress. The impressions of <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> were printed with those now in <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> Copies G, H, and T, which are all missing plates 39, 44, 45, and 48. Together, these four plates form one sheet of copper. The fact that all four plates are missing from all four copies suggests that the plates were not yet part of <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> at the time of this printing. These four color-printed copies of <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> appear to have been intended as autonomous publications. At any rate, there are no extant sets of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> impressions printed in this style, Copies G and H remain without <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi>, and Copies F and T were assembled by someone other than Blake.<lb/><lb/><hi rend="i">Songs</hi> Copy L, like Copy F, is in the Yale Center for British Art. Unlike Copies C and F, though, its two parts were printed together in a uniform style, dark brown ink on one side of the leaf, ca. 1795. It has all 54 plates, including plate 52, that make up the combined <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> and is numbered by Blake 1-54.<lb/><lb/>
            All of these editions have newly edited SGML-encoded texts and all are fully searchable for both text and images and supported by the unique Inote and ImageSizer applications described in our previous updates. We now have twenty-nine copies of sixteen illuminated books in the Archive. We will soon be adding two more copies of <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> and an in-depth illustrated Tour highlighting the Archive's features and some ways to use its resources. We will continue to add new electronic editions of illuminated books throughout the spring and summer.

One, probably the "little English boy" (line 6) whom the little black boy

"N" and 
"S" and the terminal "g" (line 1).  There are also three prominent leafy formations in this area: one at the

The dominant form is perhaps the vegetation with flame-like leaves that swirls in the spaces of

down the left margin.  Tendrils extending from both margins help separate the stanzas from one
another.  The vine right of the final stanza on the plate has several loops suggesting a spiral.  The
vine full of leaves and flowers(?) that extends across the top of the plate above the title
and fills the top right corner and the space right of the first stanza is distinct from the flame-like 
vegetation that dominates the rest of the plate.  Extensions of letters in the title (line 1) contribute to both 
forms of vegetation: the initial "A" and "C" to the vine above, the "S" to both.  In the text of the

laid out on a draped table (possibly a bier) that extends from the left to right edge of the design. 
The two mourners are seen in profile facing left, their heads looking down toward the bodies, and
holding their hands to their heads in gestures of distress, perhaps crying or in prayer.  The corpses
are arranged with their heads resting on pillows at left.  Except for their flesh-colored faces, the
two might be taken for tomb effigies.  In the background is a paneled wall or partition flanked by
pilasters—a cemetery wall, tomb, or church interior.  In other copies, the right pilaster is inscribed
with the ostensible date of publication, "1794" (line 4), but this date is completely obscured by the color
printing in this copy.  A triangular shadow covers part of the floor or ground beneath the young

anything other than interlinear and marginal designs.  Beneath its text, beside a tree with leafless
branches that occupies the right margin, are two figures.  At the base of the tree a gowned female
with long hair reclines, her head apparently supported by her bent left arm.  She may be the pretty
rose tree of the poem.  At her feet, facing right and to the right of a tuft of grass, is a second
figure, wearing tights(?) and sitting (or perhaps kneeling) hunched over in a contracted position. 
This may be the male speaker of the poem who "tend[s]" the rose-tree "by day and by night" (line
7).  He may hold his bent arm around his head or on his right shoulder.  In the sky between the
two figures are one large and nine small flying birds.  A vine with several leaves springs from the
lower right corner of the design and rises right of the second stanza.  Slight pink washes suggest
clouds, and possibly a sunrise or sunset, behind the figures.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="AB"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>reclining</characteristic><characteristic>head up</characteristic><characteristic>head on hand</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>rose</characteristic><characteristic>melancholy</characteristic><characteristic>eyes closed</characteristic><illusobjdesc>At the base of the tree a gowned female with long hair reclines, her head
