The verso of this monochrome wash drawing includes another alternative preliminary wash drawing for Commins (see Object 47).  The discovery (or rediscovery) of this wash drawing was announced in Martin Butlin, "Two Newly Identified Sketches for Thomas Commins's *An Elegy* and Further Rediscovered Drawings of the 1780s," *Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly*, 26.1 (summer 1992): 21-26.</p></objnote>

                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>This wash drawing depicts three figures in an oval frame. On the right, a bearded man steps out of a boat. His left leg is drawn back behind him, with his toes on top of the hull of the boat. His right leg is outside of the boat and extends forward to the shore or bank. The man’s right arm is extended down and grasps the edge of the boat. His left arm is bent at a ninety-degree angle with his hand is raised in front of his chest with fingers spread, as if protecting or bracing himself. He is hunched forward and twists so that his body faces left, but his head faces right. He looks up at something above and behind him. He has long, wavy hair, a long beard, and wears a tunic. Two winged, probably male angels stand on the shore. They both look down at the man to their right. The left-most figure of the pair has long hair and the right-most figure has short curly hair. The left-most figure bends his right arm ninety degrees to wrap his arm around his torso. Both figures’ right arms are at their sides. One foot of each figure protrudes from the bottom of their long gowns. The figures appear on the shore of a lake or other body of water. One pointed edge of an anchor appears at the bottom of the drawing, and it appears to be attached to the rope draped over the edge of the boat. At least five tall, slender trees are in the background. Dark wash suggests more vegetation, possibly trees and bushes, in the background.</illusobjdesc>
