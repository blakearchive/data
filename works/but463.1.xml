            The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of 20 of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible. These designs illustrate the Old Testament and are arranged according to the passages illustrated.  They are presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).
            <lb/><lb/>
            The Bible had an enormous influence on Blake’s work as both artist and poet.  Among his many and complex responses to that text are water color drawings.  The present group of 20 is selected from a sequence of about 80 biblical water colors of similar size Blake painted for Thomas Butts between c. 1800 and 1805.  These designs emphasize interactions between the human and the divine.  In works such as <hi rend="i">Ezekiel’s Wheels</hi> and <hi rend="i">David Delivered Out of Many Waters</hi>, the interaction is revelatory or redemptive.  In other designs, including <hi rend="i">Pestilence: The Death of the First-Born</hi>, the relationship between God and humankind devolves into punishment and destruction.
            <lb/><lb/>
            This group of 20 water colors is the first installment in our publication of a large selection of Blake’s water color drawings illustrating the Bible.  In coming months we will publish a group of New Testament illustrations also from the series executed for Butts.  Later we will add early works, such as <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>, datable to c. 1780, and continue through Blake’s final biblical water colors, including <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi> of c. 1824.

Dominating the center of the design is God, an old male figure with long hair and a beard. He wears a gown and sits, facing forward, on a throne or chair covered by a cloth. His legs are bent and His arms are at His side, though bent to hold on His lap an open book, at which He looks and presumably reads. God is seated on a throne or chair covered by a cloth, atop a dais with four steps. Sitting on the bottom step are two figures. The leftmost figure is that of a male, with long, curly hair and a beard. He is Christ-like in appearance and probably personifies Mercy. He sits, facing right and leans to embrace and kiss the female figure to his right, at whom he is looking. The lower half of his body is twisted to face left, as his knees are bent and his left foot protrudes from beneath his gown. The figure to the right is a female with long, curly hair that is almost flame-like.  She is probably a personification of Truth. She sits, twisted, so that the lower half of her body faces right (with her right foot protruding from beneath her gown) and the upper half of her body facing left to embrace and kiss the male figure to her left, at whom she is looking. Her head faces slightly forward as well. Between the two embracing figures is a large Maltese cross. Surrounding God are twelve male angels, all winged and wearing gowns, and all looking at God, six to His left and six to His right. The frontmost angel to the left has long hair and bends his right arm upward to hold to his chest. He faces right. The next angel above has short, curly hair. He faces right and slightly down. His hands may be together in prayer or supplication. The third angel has short, curly hair and seems to have his palms together, as though in prayer or supplication. He faces right and forward. The next angel above has short, curly hair and may be smiling. He faces right, down, and slightly forward. The next angel above has short, curly hair and faces right and down. He may have his hands together as though in prayer or supplication. The upper-most angel on the left has short, curly hair and faces right and down. He raises his right arm horizontally and bends it slightly to embrace the upper-most angel in the group to the right of God. The frontmost angel to the right of God has long, slightly curly hair and faces left and down. He has his left arm at his side, though bent upward to hold his hand to his chest. The next angel above has long, slightly curly hair and faces left and forward. He may be smiling. The next angel has short, curly hair and faces left and forward, as well as slightly down. His arms are bent upward, palms together, as though in prayer or supplication. The next angel above has short, curly hair and faces left and down. The angel second from the top has long hair and faces left and down. The upper-most angel has long hair and faces left and down so that only the lower half of his face (along with his torso and hair) are visible. He appears to raise his left arm horizontally. This scene presumably takes place in heaven.
