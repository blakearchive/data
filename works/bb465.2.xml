                The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of electronic editions of Blake's illustrations to works by William Hayley, including his <hi rend="i">Essay on Sculpture</hi>, the broadside ballad <hi rend="i">Little Tom the Sailor</hi>, <hi rend="i">The Triumphs of Temper</hi>, <hi rend="i">The Life and Posthumous Writings of William Cowper</hi>, and <hi rend="i">The Life of George Romney</hi>. We are also republishing Blake’s etched and engraved illustrations to <hi rend="i">Designs to a Series of Ballads, Written by William Hayley</hi> (1802) and Hayley’s <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi> (1805). The designs and engraved texts of both sets of <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi>&#160;illustrations, as well as the new material now being published, are fully searchable.<lb/><lb/>
                In late 1799, William Hayley was seeking an engraver to illustrate his poem <hi rend="i">Essay on Sculpture</hi>. Possibly on the advice of the sculptor John Flaxman, Hayley commissioned Blake to produce three plates. In July 1800, Blake spent much of July working on the final plate, an engraving of Hayley’s deceased son, Thomas, in Hayley’s library in the coastal village of Felpham, West Sussex. During these weeks, Hayley persuaded Blake to relocate from London to Felpham to work on a number of graphic projects.  Disenchanted with his failure to secure commercial engraving work in London, Blake enthusiastically took up Hayley’s offer.<lb/><lb/>                                                
                The works now published and republished include all of Blake’s commercial engravings executed for Hayley during the three-year period Blake and his wife Catherine spent in Felpham. In addition, the Blake Archive is publishing two more engravings Blake worked on for Hayley after the Blakes had returned to London in September 1803. These plates were commissioned to illustrate Hayley’s <hi rend="i">The Life of George Romney</hi> (1809). Only one of these plates, <hi rend="i">Sketch of a Shipwreck after Romney</hi>, was included in the published biography. The other, a portrait engraving of Romney, was rejected and, until very recently, has not been seen since the 1939 Blake exhibition in Philadelphia. <lb/><lb/>

                <lb/><lb/><b>May 2009</b><lb/><lb/>
            The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of Blake's etchings and engravings of his illustrations to <hi rend="i">Designs to a Series of Ballads, Written by William Hayley</hi> (1802) and to the 1805 edition of Hayley's <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi>. These nineteen plates, all but two of which are based on Blake's own designs, are presented in our Preview mode, which provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (our image annotation program). <lb/><lb/>

            While Blake was resident in Felpham on the Sussex coast, beginning in 1801, his new patron William Hayley began to write a series of ballads to be illustrated by the artist-engraver. These were published in 1802 as quarto numbers, each with a frontispiece, headpiece, and tailpiece by Blake. As the general title page indicates, the poems all deal with "Anecdotes Relating to Animals." In his preface, Hayley states that his plan was to issue one ballad a month "and to complete the whole series in fifteen Numbers." The letterpress text was printed by the Chichester printer Joseph Seagrave; the plates were printed by Blake and his wife Catherine on their own rolling press. Although two book dealers, P. Humphry and R. H. Evans, were selected to sell the ballads, most copies seem to have been sold by Hayley to his friends. Sales were less than brisk and the project ceased after only four ballads were issued. Blake designed and executed twelve plates, including a frontispiece for the general title page and a tailpiece to the preface, both issued with the first ballad. Two further plates were engraved by Blake after designs on antique gems (Plates 5 and 11, the tailpieces to "The Elephant" and "The Lion").<lb/><lb/>

            We are also publishing a closely related work, Blake's five illustrations for the 1805 edition of Hayley's <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi>. In January 1805, Hayley contacted the London bookseller Richard Phillips about publishing a new, octavo edition of the ballads. Blake began to execute engravings for this edition no later than March and completed five plates by June. For this 1805 volume, Hayley added twelve ballads to the four published in 1802. Blake engraved new, smaller plates of his designs for three of the 1802 ballads (Plates 1-3) and both designed and engraved new illustrations for two of the additional ballads (Plates 4-5). Blake and Phillips were to "go equal shares ... in the expense and the profits" (Blake's letter to Hayley of 22 January 1805, Erdman page 763), but it is unlikely that Blake made any profit. Robert Southey's mocking review of Hayley's poems and Blake's illustration to "The Dog" (Plate 1) appeared in the <hi rend="i">Annual Review</hi> for 1805.<lb/><lb/>

She is identified as Boulla in Hayley's poem "The Lion."  She is the mother of the boy to the right and the wife of the male in the tree, above and to the left.  Her right arm is bent upward with the palm of her right hand turned up and the fingers slightly spread.  Her left arm is raised and she holds a stringed bow in her left hand.  A dark-skinned male child stands to the right of Boulla.  He is not identified in the poem by name, but likely represents Boulla's son.  The figure is nude and faces forward with his genitals exposed.  Three arrows rest on the ground below Boulla and the male child.  Two palm trees grow along the left and right borders of the design.  Both have detailed trunks and arching palm leaves.  The rightmost tree has visible roots.  A dark-skinned male appears in the upper left corner of the design, among the leaves of the leftmost palm tree.  Identified in Hayley's poem as Demba, he is the husband of the female archer and the father of the male child.  Only his upper body is visible.  His arms are bent upwards and he holds onto palm leaves with both hands.  A lion stands on a cliff or ledge in the lower left portion of the design.  Its tail is raised.  The lion's mouth is open with teeth visible and tongue extended.  Its neck is pierced by an arrow, and it wears an expression of pain.  A distant river or stream is visible in the lower portion of the design, between the lion and Boulla.  At least two mountains rise above the river to the left.  A cliff stands on the right shore of the river; there are slight indications of a waterfall at the edge of this cliff, just left of Boulla's left foot.  Indeterminate leafy vegetation left and right of Boulla and her son may suggest a distant forest or jungle.  Leafy vegetation also appears on either shore of the river below.  Lines indicate a sky with clouds throughout.  Hayley's poem, "The Lion," indicates that the setting is Africa and the figures are African.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>mother</characteristic><characteristic>Boulla</characteristic><characteristic>African</characteristic><characteristic>short hair</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>arms raised</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised horizontally</characteristic><characteristic>seen from behind</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>facing away</characteristic><characteristic>twisted</characteristic><characteristic>fingers spread</characteristic><characteristic>hand raised, palm up</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>legs bent</characteristic><characteristic>leg extended backward</characteristic><characteristic>tiptoe</characteristic><characteristic>legs spread</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>seen from behind</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>dark-skinned</characteristic><characteristic>skirt</characteristic><characteristic>partly nude</characteristic><characteristic>scarf</characteristic><characteristic>cloth</characteristic><characteristic>hat</characteristic><characteristic>bow</characteristic><characteristic>string</characteristic><characteristic>shooting</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A dark-skinned female stands in the lower right portion of the design.

He faces forward and to the right; he appears to look toward the dog to the right.  He represents the hermit named Bruno in Hayley's poem, "The Hermit's Dog."  The figure steps up onto a raised section of the ground with his left leg bent forward.  His left arm is bent and he holds a staff or walking stick in his left hand.  To the right, a dog sits or crouches on the body of a dead vulture.  The dog, named Hero in Hayley's poem, faces right with its head turned up; it may look at the vulture flying above.  The dog's mouth is open with its teeth and tongue clearly visible; it may be barking.  A vulture flies to the right in the upper portion of the design, directy above the dog.  Both wings extend to the left.  The vulture's head is down and turned to the left; it looks at the dog below.  The body of a dead vulture lies on the ground below the dog.  Its wings are outstretched horizontally.  Its head is down and rests on the torso of the dead male below.  The corpse of a partly nude male lies supine on the ground below the dog.  His body extends horizontally across the design with his feet to the left and his head to the right.  He is identified in Hayley's poem as the dog's master.  The figure wears breeches or other short pants.  His left arm rests on the ground and extends down and to the right; the palm of his left hand is turned upward.  An empty scabbard rests on the ground near the figure's left leg and is attached to a cord or strap at his waist.  A cloak or other cloth lies on the ground beneath the body of the dead male.  A design is visible on the cloth just below the figure's torso; it is probably the "Malta's cross" mentioned in Hayley's poem.  A sword rests on the ground below the dead figure.  The ground below the figures is covered with grass.  Leafy vegetation appears in the lower right corner of the image.  The trunks of three leafless and possibly dead trees appear right of the hermit.  Each trunk divides into several distinct branches in the upper portion of the design.  A distant forest of leafy trees appears to the left and right of the dog, extending horizontally across the image.  Two tree trunks appear just right of the hermit's left knee.  A group of distant mountains rises above the forest just above the dog's head and between the two rightmost tree trunks.  Lines in the upper portion of the design suggest a sky with several clouds.  A light area on the horizon on the right hints at a sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="AC"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>hermit</characteristic><characteristic>Bruno</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>arm at side</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>arm down</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>striding</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>left foot</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent forward</characteristic><characteristic>leg drawn up</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>palm down</characteristic><characteristic>bald</characteristic><characteristic>belt</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>old</characteristic><characteristic>robe</characteristic><characteristic>collar</characteristic><characteristic>hood</characteristic><characteristic>chain</characteristic><characteristic>cross</characteristic><characteristic>rope</characteristic><characteristic>staff</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A bald, bearded male stands or strides near the left border of the design.

Her body faces to the left with her head twisted to the right.  Her left arm is wrapped around her upper torso and her right arm is raised over her head with the palm of her right hand vertical.  Her mouth is open and her eyes are wide; she looks toward the horse with an expression of fear and surprise.  A body of waterperhaps a river, stream, or lakeextends across the lower border of the design.  The figures stand on the shore of a body of water.  Grass is visible at the water's edge, just below the woman and her daughter.  The horse stands on a large mound or hill, which may also be covered by grass.  A large hill or cliff rises above the horse.  It is covered with grass.  The trunks of four leafless trees appear in the background of the image.
