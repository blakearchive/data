God’s left hand rests on a book or tablet (of laws?) on his lap.  God may be holding the horses' reins in his right hand, or a rod, scepter, or fiery beam (?) pointing at Adam.  God is backed by a circle or globe of fire; the sky above and to the left is filled with yellow light.

He faces to the right with his left leg bent behind him, and his left foot poised on tiptoe.  He may be striding toward God.
