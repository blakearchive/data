God, riding on a fiery chariot, holds his book of laws on his lap and points toward Adam with his extended right arm.

God’s left hand rests on a book or tablet (of laws?) on his lap.  God may be holding the horses' reins in his right hand, or a rod, scepter, or fiery beam (?) pointing at Adam.  God is backed by a circle or globe of fire; the sky above and to the left is filled with yellow light.

His left arm is bent at the elbow, and his left hand rests on the book or tablet on his lap.  His bare left foot is visible beneath the hem of his gown, and appears to be resting on a platform of the chariot.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="object" location="CD"><characteristic>book</characteristic><characteristic>tablet</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A book or tablet (of laws?) rests on God’s lap.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="object" location="AB"><characteristic>rod</characteristic><characteristic>scepter</characteristic><characteristic>fire</characteristic><characteristic>flame-like</characteristic><characteristic>rein</characteristic><characteristic>line</characteristic><illusobjdesc>God may be holding a red, flame-like scepter or rod in his right hand, pointed toward Adam.

He faces to the right with his left leg bent behind him, and his left foot poised on tiptoe.  He may be striding toward God.  His arms (or at least his right arm) are probably bent upward, for his right hand is raised to his forehead and his palms may be together in prayer.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="object" location="AB"><characteristic>light</characteristic><characteristic>sky</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The sky is filled with yellow light.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="vegetation" location="C"><characteristic>grass</characteristic><characteristic>moss</characteristic><characteristic>lichens</characteristic><characteristic>indeterminate</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The reticulations of the color printing suggest that grass, moss, lichens, or some such vegetation may grow beneath the feet of Adam and the horses.</illusobjdesc></component></illustration></illusdesc><phystext><vspace extent="8"/><lg type="prose" justify="left"><l n="but295.1.cprint.01.01" justify="left">Fresco W Blake inv.-</l></lg></phystext></desc></objdesc></bad>
