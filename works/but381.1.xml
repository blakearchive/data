The signature is now very faint.  An enhanced image of the monogram has been provided below.  A rectangular indentation in the canvas extends around the figures approximately 2.7 cm. from the inner lip of the present frame.  This appears to have been caused by a previous frame used to cover damaged areas, now restored, around the periphery of the design.  Butlin 381 records an inscription on the back, "Genesis XIX c. 31 &amp; 32 v."  The painting is now backed with thick paper and any such inscription is no longer visible.</p><illus filename="but381.1.1.sg.300.jpg"/></objnote><objsize>26.3 x 37.8 cm.</objsize><windowsize width="780" height="600"/></physdesc><illusdesc><illustration type="plate" location="E"><illusobjdesc>This design, based on Genesis 19:30-35, is dominated by the figures of Lot and his daughters, who stand to either side of him. Lot reclines facing forward, asleep with eyes closed, with his head resting on his left fist. His left arm is bent upward and rests on a rock; his right arm rests at his side. Lot has short, curly hair and a beard and is partly nude, with just a cloth covering his genitals. The daughter to the left of Lot is twisted so that her upper body faces left and her lower body faces forward. She has long hair and is partly nude, with a cloth partly covering her lower body. She reaches with her right hand to lift Lot's loincloth. The daughter to the right of Lot also has long hair and is partly clothed by a cloth secured around her waist. She looks to the left at her father and sister, resting her right arm and leg on the outjutting of rock that Lot lies on. Her left arm rests by her side. The figures are sheltered in a shadowy and rocky cave, which also contains two cups and a bag or sack. The goblet to the left of the rightmost daughter's foot is overturned and looks empty, suggesting that Lot has imbibed its contents. The goblet to the right stands upright. Outside of the cave's entrance stands a small leafy tree—perhaps a grapevine with clusters of grapes hanging from its branches—and a city with a spire is visible in the background, probably representing Sodom and/or Gomorrah. The sky outside the cave appears to be dark, and a sunset or the glow from the city's destruction may be indicated by the lighter shades at the horizon.  Lot's wife, turned to a pillar of salt, stands, a tiny figure, half-way between the fork in the tree or vine and the city on the horizon.
