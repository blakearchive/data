At the bottom center of the design kneels Mary Magdalene, a gowned female figure with long curly hair. She bends forward, facing right and down. Her right foot is visible beneath the hem of her gown. Her right arm is raised horizontally and bent upward; in her right hand she holds Christ's right foot. Her left arm is raised horizontally and bent slightly; in her left hand, she holds the end of her own hair. She looks down at Christ's foot and kisses it. She is also crying; see Luke 7:38, where she washes Christ's "feet with tears." Two tears are visible below her right eye. To the right of Mary Magdalene, on the floor, is a jar with an open lid; according to Luke 7:37, this is a "box of ointment." Its visible side is decorated with three figures.  The leftmost figure appears to be walking to the left, arms raised horizontally.  The central figure may also be facing and walking left, right(?) arm raise at 135 degrees and left(?) arm raised at 45 degrees.  These two figures may be holding hands and dancing rather than walking.  The figure on the right may be facing left. The figure to the right of Mary Magdalene is Christ, with long, curly hair and a beard. He wears a long gown, though both feet are visible beneath its hem. He reclines, leaning on what appears to be a long upholstered bench or couch, with his right arm at his side but bent so he can lean on his elbow against a rolled up cloth or rug. His left arm is at his side and resting. Both legs are bent. He faces away but looks to the left. Behind Christ and Mary Magdalene is a large table, overlaid with a tablecloth. Sitting on the table are three plates and two cups, goblets, or glasses. On the left side of the table sit three gowned figures. The frontmost figure is a woman, with a veil covering her hair. She sits with her right leg bent underneath her, facing right and away slightly. Both feet are visible beneath the hem of her gown. Her right arm is resting at her side. She may look toward Christ's feet. The middle figure of the group is a man with a beard. He also wears a covering over his head. His body faces right but his head is turned to look forward and up, eyes raised. The rightmost figure of the group is a man with long hair and a beard. His body faces forward and left but his head is turned to look right. His arm is bent in front of him; he may be leaning on the table. On the right side of the table sit three gowned figures. The leftmost figure is an old man with long hair and a long beard, possibly the Pharisee hosting the dinner (see Luke 7:37). He faces forward and looks slightly right, presumably at Christ. He casts a shadow on the wall behind him, slightly to the left. His left arm is at his side but bent, with his left hand on the table and pointing left. The middle figure of this group is a man with curly hair and a beard; he is also partly bald. His arms are crossed and resting on the table. He faces forward, looking at Christ. The rightmost figure of this group is possibly a female with long hair or a veil covering her hair. She (?) faces left; her face is not visible. The scene takes place in a room with pilasters and an arched alcove or recess on the back wall. A patterned carpet that includes stripes and triangular decorations covers the floor in the foreground. Jesus and the woman sitting to the left side of the design both sit on an upholstered bench or couch, covered in cloth, or a rolled-up rug; Christ also reclines on what appears to be a rolled-up rug.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="CD"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>Mary Magdalene</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>kneeling</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>bending forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>facing down</characteristic><characteristic>hem</characteristic><characteristic>right foot</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised horizontally</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>kissing</characteristic><characteristic>crying</characteristic><characteristic>tears</characteristic><illusobjdesc>At the bottom center of the design kneels Mary Magdalene, a gowned female figure with long curly hair, most likely Mary Magdalene.
