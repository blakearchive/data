<updatestmt> 
The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of a digital edition of forty-seven monochrome wash drawings created by Blake between c. 1774 and c. 1786.  
<lb/>
<lb/>
The use of monochrome washes to tint a pencil or pen and ink drawing offered eighteenth-century artists several advantages. They could register gradations in tone, from the white of the untouched paper to jet black, without the more time-consuming use of actual colors. No further work was required if the wash drawing was intended as a preliminary for an uncolored engraving. A monochrome wash could also be used to underlie subsequent applications of water colors, thereby darkening selected areas to create the illusion of depth or cast motifs in shadow.  
<lb/>
<lb/>
As the works presented here show, Blake made full use of monochrome washes from his earliest years as an artist. When assigned by his engraving master, James Basire, to record tombs in Westminster Abbey c. 1774-75, Blake applied black and gray washes to tint many of his drawings (Objects 1-5). These carefully executed works could then be used as preliminaries for subsequent engravings by Basire’s workshop.
<lb/>
<lb/>
Blake’s monochrome washes during his first decade as an independent artist and engraver include several interrelated groups. The seven drawings of figures from Michelangelo’s Sistine ceiling (Objects 37-43) demonstrate how copying engravings of works by Renaissance masters helped Blake learn postures and gestures he would later use in his own compositions. Other drawings provide visual evidence of how Blake developed a design from early sketches to highly finished water colors or engravings. The recto/verso drawings, <hi rend="i">Two Sketches for “Joseph Making Himself Known to His Brethren”</hi> (Objects 34 and 35), are preliminaries for the finished water color in the Fitzwilliam Museum, one of three illustrations of the biblical story of Joseph that are among Blake’s finest pictorial works of the 1780s. The three Joseph water colors are in the Archive along with a water color preliminary for <hi rend="i">Joseph Ordering Simeon to be Bound</hi>. The evolution of one of Blake’s earliest original book illustrations, a frontispiece for Thomas Commins’ <hi rend="i">Elegy Set to Music</hi> of 1786, can be traced through three variant wash drawings (Objects 45-47) and a pencil sketch also in the Archive. The four wash versions of <hi rend="i">The Good Farmer</hi> reproduced here (Objects 16-19), in addition to two pen and ink drawings of the subject previously added to the Archive, show the complex ways Blake played variations on a theme as he worked toward a final version. No such finished work is known, and thus these drawings are our only record of Blake’s engagement with this subject. Similarly, for <hi rend="i">War Unchained by an Angel, Fire, Pestilence, and Famine Following</hi>, an untraced work Blake exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1784, we have only a preliminary study (Object 6).
<lb/>
<lb/>
Blake’s illustrations to his poem <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> of c. 1789 are among his most accomplished monochrome wash drawings. These have been published in the Archive as an independent group coordinated with the <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> manuscript.

                    <illusobjdesc>The composition depicts the tomb monument to Anne of Cleves in Westminster Abbey. The monument has three main components, all of which sit on a narrow, low platform. The three sections are of equal height, appear to be made of stone, and have undecorated, flat tops. A long, rectangular central structure is flanked by two narrower structures at right and left. The side of the central structure facing the viewer is divided into rectangular panels and intricately decorated. Two vertical panels on the right and left ends of the structure protrude slightly outward and span the monument's height. The left panel includes a central circle with the initials "AC" for Anne of Cleves. The insignia is topped by a crown with three visible trefoils. Additional vegetative and other motifs decorate the panel. The rightmost panel also contains a central circle topped by a crown surrounded by vegetative and other decorative motifs. Inside the circle here is a eight-pointed star or compass. The central section of the monument is divided into two horizontal sections with three large panels in each. The three panels in the upper section are undecorated; however, the four smaller spaces separating them are filled with vegetative or other abstract motifs. The three panels in the lower section each contain a skull and crossbones as well as a winding ribbon. The central skull faces forward while the skull at left faces right and the skill at right faces left. Four tall, slender vases, each with different decorations, are visible in the spaces separating these lower panels. The monument's narrower structures at left and right have identical decorations on the side facing the viewer: a central oval encircling the head of a lion with an open mouth surrounded above and below by vegetative or other decorative motifs. On both structures, a second decorative panel is visible on the side facing the longer middle structure; however, the details of this design are indistinguishable. Triangular areas of shadow are visible on the monument's supporting platform to the left of both the left most structure and the central structure. A scale measuring eighteen feet is visible near the bottom edge of the composition.</illusobjdesc>
