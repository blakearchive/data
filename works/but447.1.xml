                electronic edition of 20 of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible. These
                designs illustrate the Old Testament and are arranged according to the passages
                illustrated. They are presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the
                features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed
                descriptions of Blake’s images). <lb/><lb/> The Bible had an enormous influence on Blake’s work as both artist and poet.
                Among his many and complex responses to that text are water color drawings. The
                present group of 20 is selected from a sequence of about 80 biblical water colors of
                similar size Blake painted for Thomas Butts between c. 1800 and 1805. These designs
                emphasize interactions between the human and the divine. In works such as <hi rend="i">Ezekiel’s Wheels</hi> and <hi rend="i">David Delivered Out of Many
                    Waters</hi>, the interaction is revelatory or redemptive. In other designs,
                including <hi rend="i">Pestilence: The Death of the First-Born</hi>, the
                relationship between God and humankind devolves into punishment and destruction. <lb/><lb/> This group of 20 water colors is the first installment in our publication of a
                large selection of Blake’s water color drawings illustrating the Bible. In coming
                months we will publish a group of New Testament illustrations also from the series
                executed for Butts. Later we will add early works, such as <hi rend="i">Abraham and
                    Isaac</hi>, datable to c. 1780, and continue through Blake’s final biblical
                water colors, including <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi>
                of c. 1824. <lb/><lb/> As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access
                restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible by the
                University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the continuing support of the Library

                        this design is a large pole with a horizontal log at the top, so that the
                        pole resembles a cross. Around the pole is wrapped a large serpent covered
                        in scales. Its crested head faces up. Its mouth is open with one tooth and
                        extended tongue visible. To the left of the pole stands a male figure,
                        presumably Moses, facing away and slightly right. He wears a gown and has
                        curly hair and a beard. His arms are at his side, palms down, and his left
                        leg is bent back and on tiptoe. He seems to be looking up at the serpent on
                        the pole. A large serpent is wrapped around Moses's waist and shoulders. Its
                        crested head lies on the ground to the right of Moses, with its visible eye
                        closed. It may be sleeping or dead. To either side of Moses stands a small
                        child, presumably female, with long hair and a gown. The child to the left
                        of Moses stands, facing to the right. Her head is bowed. The girl to the
                        right of Moses stands, facing left. Her left leg may be extended backward.
                        To the left of the serpent's pole, three nude, male figures hover in the
                        air; each figure has a serpent entwining him. The leftmost figure faces
                        away, with his left leg bent. He has short hair and bends his arms upward to
                        cover his head. The serpent entwined around this figure coils twice around
                        his leg and once around his waist. It faces up, with its mouth open and a
                        crest on its head. Its tongue is extended and it may be breathing fire. The
                        middle figure hovers in mid-air, upside down. His legs are bent and his left
                        arm appears to be raised over his head. His mouth is open. The serpent
                        coiled around this figure has three loops in this tail and wraps around his
                        waist and neck. Its head faces to the right and slightly down. Its head is
                        crested and its mouth is open, displaying two fangs and a tongue. It may
                        also breathe fire. A trail of fire may extend from this serpent's tail or
                        from the man's right leg. This serpent may be looking at the serpent below.
                        The rightmost figure of this group faces right and slightly forward. His
                        right arm is bent over his head and his right leg is bent. He may be partly
                        clothed by a cloth that drapes around his waist and over his right leg. His
                        mouth is open and he has short hair. He may be looking at Moses. The serpent
                        wrapped around this figure has one loop in its tail and wraps around his
                        waist and neck. Its head faces up and its mouth is open, with one tooth and
                        tongue visible. It may also breathe fire at the serpent above, at which it
                        looks. To the right of the serpent's pole, one figure hovers in mid-air.
                        This figure is male and nude, with short, curly hair. He faces away and to
                        the left and is upside down. His right leg is bent backward. The serpent
                        that wraps around this figure has three loops around its tail and coils
                        around his waist and neck. Its head faces to the left and slightly forward,
                        and is crested. Its mouth is open, tongue extended, and may breathe fire as
                        well. To the right of the serpent's pole are five human figures on the
                        ground. The leftmost is a nude male figure who lies, supine, with his head
                        bent back. His mouth is open and he has short, curly hair. He may be partly
                        clothed by a cloth secured around his waist. His arm is at his side and his
                        left leg is bent. The serpent that wraps around this figure coils around his
                        chest and lies with its crested head on the ground to the figure's right.
                        Its one visible eye is closed and it may be sleeping or dead. The
                        second-to-left figure is that of a partly nude male with short, curly hair,
                        standing facing forward and to the left. He turns his head to look away. He
                        is partly clothed by a transparent cloth or pair of breeches around his
                        waist. His arms are raised horizontally, palms vertical, and his right leg
                        is bent forward with his left leg extended backward. To the left of this
                        second-to-left figure is a large serpent whose crested head faces up. Its
                        mouth is open with one fang and an extended forked tongue visible. It may
                        breath fire. The middle figure of this group is a female, facing left and
                        forward, though with her head bent back to look upward. She wears a gown and
                        stands with her left leg bent. She may have long hair. Her mouth as partly
                        open and her right arm is bent upward to rest on and perhaps holds the
                        serpent that coils around her. The serpent that coils around this figure
                        wraps around her waist and neck and holds its head facing down. The
                        second-to-right figure of this group is a female who stands, facing forward
                        and to the right slightly. She looks upward and bends her arms, with her
                        hands held together as if in prayer or supplication. She has long hair and
                        wears a gown. Her mouth is slightly open. The rightmost figure of this group
                        is a gowned female, facing left and slightly away. She is small and thus may
                        be a child. She has long hair and bends her head down to rest on her left
                        hand. Her left arm is bent upward. The earth in the foreground appears to be
                        grassy. The sky backing this scene is slightly cloudy and has hints of fire,
                        perhaps from the serpents or from sunrise or sunset. </illusobjdesc><component type="object" location="E"><characteristic>pole</characteristic><characteristic>wood</characteristic><characteristic>cross</characteristic><characteristic>serpent-coiled</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Dominating the center of this design is a large pole with a
