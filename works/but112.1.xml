<updatestmt> 
The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of a digital edition of forty-seven monochrome wash drawings created by Blake between c. 1774 and c. 1786.  
<lb/>
<lb/>
The use of monochrome washes to tint a pencil or pen and ink drawing offered eighteenth-century artists several advantages. They could register gradations in tone, from the white of the untouched paper to jet black, without the more time-consuming use of actual colors. No further work was required if the wash drawing was intended as a preliminary for an uncolored engraving. A monochrome wash could also be used to underlie subsequent applications of water colors, thereby darkening selected areas to create the illusion of depth or cast motifs in shadow.  
<lb/>
<lb/>
As the works presented here show, Blake made full use of monochrome washes from his earliest years as an artist. When assigned by his engraving master, James Basire, to record tombs in Westminster Abbey c. 1774-75, Blake applied black and gray washes to tint many of his drawings (Objects 1-5). These carefully executed works could then be used as preliminaries for subsequent engravings by Basire’s workshop.
<lb/>
<lb/>
Blake’s monochrome washes during his first decade as an independent artist and engraver include several interrelated groups. The seven drawings of figures from Michelangelo’s Sistine ceiling (Objects 37-43) demonstrate how copying engravings of works by Renaissance masters helped Blake learn postures and gestures he would later use in his own compositions. Other drawings provide visual evidence of how Blake developed a design from early sketches to highly finished water colors or engravings. The recto/verso drawings, <hi rend="i">Two Sketches for “Joseph Making Himself Known to His Brethren”</hi> (Objects 34 and 35), are preliminaries for the finished water color in the Fitzwilliam Museum, one of three illustrations of the biblical story of Joseph that are among Blake’s finest pictorial works of the 1780s. The three Joseph water colors are in the Archive along with a water color preliminary for <hi rend="i">Joseph Ordering Simeon to be Bound</hi>. The evolution of one of Blake’s earliest original book illustrations, a frontispiece for Thomas Commins’ <hi rend="i">Elegy Set to Music</hi> of 1786, can be traced through three variant wash drawings (Objects 45-47) and a pencil sketch also in the Archive. The four wash versions of <hi rend="i">The Good Farmer</hi> reproduced here (Objects 16-19), in addition to two pen and ink drawings of the subject previously added to the Archive, show the complex ways Blake played variations on a theme as he worked toward a final version. No such finished work is known, and thus these drawings are our only record of Blake’s engagement with this subject. Similarly, for <hi rend="i">War Unchained by an Angel, Fire, Pestilence, and Famine Following</hi>, an untraced work Blake exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1784, we have only a preliminary study (Object 6).
<lb/>
<lb/>
Blake’s illustrations to his poem <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> of c. 1789 are among his most accomplished monochrome wash drawings. These have been published in the Archive as an independent group coordinated with the <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> manuscript.

                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>The design is set in a room or other space with bare floors and walls. Two wide steps appear in the center, and on the top step sit two men, presumably Moses and Aaron, on chairs or thrones. Both wear long-sleeved, floor-length gowns and face forward as they hold tablets or books. The man at left (Moses) has long, white hair and a long, white beard. His left foot emerges from below the hem of his gown, and he appears to hold a tablet diagonally with both hands in front of his torso. Moses turns his head slightly to the right and gazes toward the angels near the design's right border. At right, Aaron has darker, curlier hair. He holds his book or tablet in his lap, gripping the upper corners with curved fingers. Aaron tilts his head downward to gaze at the book. The head and shoulders of an angel with long, curly hair appear between Moses and Aaron. The angel stands, sits, or hovers behind the seated brothers and turns his head slightly to the left, looking toward Moses or toward the child who stands at left. This young boy stands contrapposto, his torso facing forward with his left foot in front and his left hand on his hip. The boy may be nude or wear a transparent gown; he has short, curly hair. His head turns sharply to the right, and his chin tilts upward as he gazes toward Moses or toward the angel behind him. Seated below the boy, on the top of two large steps that extend across the lower portion of the design, is another child. This boy has long hair and appears to wear a knee-length gown. He sits, facing forward and to the right, with both legs extended and his feet resting on the top of the lower step. In his lap he holds a tablet on which he writes or draws with his right hand. His left hand holds the left side of the tablet near his left knee. The boy's head faces downward as he looks at his work. These five central figures are flanked by two groups of angels--four on the left and five on the right--who hover over the steps. The four angels at left face the right side of the design and lean in toward Moses and the others. The angel nearest the viewer wears a long skirt and a draped cloth across his chest. His right foot appears below the hem of his skirt, and his short, curly hair flows behind him. The angel's right arm bends to hold a cloth or large sheet of paper out in front of him. His left arm may extend to support the object. Immediately to the right of this angel is another, similarly clothed in a long skirt or gown. His left foot extends downward toward the step below him, his left arm rises slightly in font of him, and his head tilts downward as he looks toward the floor. The third angel, of uncertain gender, also faces right and hovers over the stairs. Above these three, in the upper left-hand corner of the design, appear the loosely sketched head and upper body of another angel. This angel faces directly right and appears to have long, straight hair. The five angels at right appear in a cluster with the two in front more clearly defined. The angel in front faces away and to the left as he hovers over the steps. His left foot extends downward from the billowing hem of his long gown. His body curves to the left, his hip nearing Aaron's left hand, and his shoulders curve back to the right. He holds a large book at his side, underneath his right arm. His left arm may be bent in front of him. The angel's long hair extends down his back and across his right shoulder as he turns to look at Moses and Aaron. To the right of this angel is another facing left. He has short, curly hair and wears a long gown or cape. Behind these angels are three more. At left, an angel faces forward but turns his head rightward to face his neighbor whose head can be seen facing left. The third angel's head appears in the very upper right-hand corner of the design. He appears to have short hair, and his head tilts downward slightly as if looking toward the human figures in the center.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>On the top step sit two men, presumably Moses and Aaron, on chairs or thrones. At right, Aaron has darker, curlier hair and wears a floor-length gown. His feet emerge from beneath the hem. He faces forward with his knees and arms bent symmetrically. Aaron holds his book or tablet in his lap, gripping the upper corners with curved fingers. Aaron tilts his head downward to gaze at the book. He may be reading.  A few lines on the open book or tablet suggest a text.</illusobjdesc>
