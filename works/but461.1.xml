The reference to the passage illustrated, lowr right, was probably written by Blake.  Traces of text, witten below the framing lines and not shown here, are almost certainly not by Blake. This pencil inscription reads as follows: "Moreover the Lord answered Job and said—Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty / instruct him? He that reproveth God let him answer it." The several verso inscriptions are later additions by collectors, dealers, or curators.</p></objnote><objsize>39.3 x 33.0 cm.</objsize><windowsize width="650" height="760"/></physdesc><related objectid="bb421.1.spb.15"/><related objectid="but550.1.wc.13"/><related objectid="but551.1.wc.13"/><related objectid="but557.1.penc.19"/><illusdesc><illustration type="plate" location="E"><illusobjdesc>The design illustrates Job 40:1-6. The central figure is God, an old, gowned man with long hair and a long beard. He hovers with his body horizontal, facing forward. His arms are horizontal, palms down. His mouth may be slightly open as he looks down at Job; He may be speaking. God appears in a burst of yellow light apparently within a circular whirlwind as the text illustrated indicates (Job 40:6). The sky in the rest of the design is dark and cloudy, though a little brighter at the horizon. God is surrounded by seven angels that fly in a circular, swirling motion. All angels appear to be male, winged, and gowned, with long hair. All angels are also seen from behind. The angel immediately below God is facing left and looking up, with his body horizontal. His left foot is visible. The angel to the left of God faces up and to the right. His hair is slightly curly. The angel to the left above God faces right, and appears to be bending slightly forward, with his body mostly horizontal. His mouth is open. The angel to the top right of God faces right and down and had curly hair. The angel to the right of God faces down but lifts his head to look slightly right. He has slightly curly hair. The angel to the bottom right of God has curly, flame-like hair and faces down and right. His mouth is open. The rightmost angel in the design is visible only as the bottom of a gown or wings. The figures at the bottom of the design kneel on bare earth, with hills visible in the background. At the bottom of the design kneels Job, an old male figure with a long beard. He faces away, but looks up and to the left at God. He wears a long gown with a hood or veil that covers most of his hair. His arms are at his side but bent upward, with his palms vertical and fingers spread. His mouth is partly open.  Job may be speaking (see Job 40:3) or simply opening his mouth in an expression of surprise. To the right of Job bow two gowned male figures, very probably Job's friends. Both face left and down, with their heads resting on their hands on the ground. The leftmost figure has short, curly hair and a beard. The rightmost figure has long hair and a long beard. Assuming that their identities are the same as in Blake's Job engravings, the frontmost figure in this group is Eliphaz with Bildad behind him. To the left of Job kneel two gowned figures, both bowing forward to put their heads on the ground. Both of these figures face right and down. The frontmost figure is a woman, most likely Job's wife. Her mouth is open, perhaps in an expression of fear. Her right arm is bent at her side, with her right hand on the ground under her head. The figure in the back is a man with curly hair and a beard. If his identity is the same as in Blake's Job engravings, this is Zophar.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="AB"><characteristic>God</characteristic><characteristic>old</characteristic><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>hovering</characteristic><characteristic>body horizontal</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing down</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>arms horizontal</characteristic><characteristic>palms down</characteristic><characteristic>flying</characteristic><characteristic>floating</characteristic><characteristic>bending forward</characteristic><characteristic>mouth open</characteristic><characteristic>speaking</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The central figure is God, an old, gowned man with long hair and a long beard.
