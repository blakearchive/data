                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>With its outdoor setting and close grouping of eight human figures and at least four animals, this drawing depicts a pastoral scene. In the lower left-hand corner, a woman kneels to milk a cow. She is nude from the waist up and covered by a long skirt from the waist down. Her long hair is gathered into a bun. The woman faces right, kneeling with both knees on the ground and her legs bent sharply so that she sits on the heels of her bare feet. Her shoulders hunch as she bends forward, lowering her head and eyes to watch her work. The woman's arms bend upward together, and her hands reach forward to hold the cow's udders. A large bucket appears below the woman's hands. The material of this bucket is unclear, but the smooth surface suggests that it is metal. Above and behind the woman, the head of a sheep is visible facing left. Wavy lines may suggest additional sheep standing behind this animal in the background. At right of the woman stands the cow, which faces forward and to the right. Only its front legs are visible; its back rises well above the woman's head. Near the cow's left shoulder some curved lines indicate rough or curly hair. Similarly, curly hair tops the cows head, from which two pointed horns extend above outward-pointing ears. The cow's head is lowered and cocked slightly to the left as its down turned muzzle meets that of the dog below. The dog lies on the ground and appears to roll onto its right side. Its tail extends along the ground to the left, coming underneath the milking woman's knees. Lines on the dog's body suggest long hair. Its head lifts upward and the dog points its nose directly upward to touch the cow's muzzle. The dog's ears point downward along its neck. Immediately to the right of the dog, a ram lies on the ground facing left. Its nose rests against the dog's back, and its visible left eye is closed as if in sleep. A large, curled horn sits just behind the ram's eye. Curved lines indicate thick, curly wool all over its body; the wool appears to cover the ram's legs as they fold underneath. Atop the ram sleeps a boy with short, curly hair. His bare shoulders suggest that he is at least partly nude. The boy faces forward and leans to the right, draping his upper body over the ram. His right arm bends upward as his hand supports his head, which is held horizontally with the crown facing right. His left arm extends behind his head, along the top of the ram, and then bends at ninety degrees so that his hand dangles; his fingers may touch the ground. The boy's eyes and mouth are closed. Above the sleeping boy sit three female figures, one of whom holds a small child. Leftmost and farthest from the viewer is a gowned woman with long hair who faces left and appears to be writing. Her right arm bends and extends forward; her right hand holds a reed or other writing implement. Her left arm may rest in her lap, and her head tilts downward toward her work. The woman in the center of the group holds a child in her lap. She wears a gown, and her hair appears to be pulled back from her face. The woman faces forward and to the left, wrapping her right arm around the child's neck and shoulders, and her left around its buttocks. She appears to kiss the child's face; she may be its mother. The babe-in-arms appears to be a nude child with short, curly hair. He(?) faces away and to the right, sitting in his mother's lap with his knees bent and his legs tucked underneath him. The soles of his feet face outward and upward. The child wraps his arms around his mother's neck and lifts his head to receive (and perhaps to return) her kiss. The woman sitting rightmost--nearest the viewer--holds a spindle, distaff, or some other object and looks at the other women. Her body faces forward and to the left, and her long gown drapes in folds over her lap. This gown may be decorated by a round collar, or the woman may wear a necklace with a bead or pendant in the center. Her long hair is gathered into a bun. The woman's bare right arm bends upward to grasp the spindle or distaff with her palm facing toward her. The spindle or distaff is held at an angle away from the woman. The woman's left arm may dangle at her side, her hand approaching the head of the sleeping boy. Her head appears in profile as she faces left and looks downward. At right of the three seated women stand two old men wearing long-sleeved gowns. Each has curly hair and a long beard. The man at left faces forward and slightly to the right, toward his companion. His eyes are closed, and his arm is lowered in front of his body, holding a set of graduated pipes. He may be a musician. The man at right faces forward and to the left. His left leg bends forward slightly, suggesting that he may be walking to the left; his bare left foot appears, also pointing left, beneath the hem of his gown. The man's lowered left arm bends as he holds a shepherd's crook across his body, from his right foot to his left shoulder. His right arm bends upward as he brings his hand to his chin, perhaps in a contemplative posture or to cover his mouth. The man bends forward slightly, and his head tilts downward as he looks out in front of him. He may be a shepherd. The ground beneath these figures and animals appears to be bare; in the upper half of the drawing, the background is filled with indeterminate vegetation--perhaps bushes and deciduous trees--and large panels of cloth that indicate a tent. Shadows appear beneath each of the figures kneeling or lying on the ground, in the lap of the rightmost woman, and beneath the shepherd's feet. </illusobjdesc>

Its tail extends along the ground to the left, coming underneath the milking woman's knees. Lines on the dog's body suggest long hair. Its head lifts upward, pointing its nose directly upward to touch the cow's muzzle. The dog's ears point downward along its neck.</illusobjdesc>
