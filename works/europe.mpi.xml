            <seriesstmt>The William Blake Archive</seriesstmt>
  <updatestmt>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of forty-one proofs, impressions in different states, posthumous impressions, and lifetime impressions of <hi rend="i">Europe a Prophecy</hi>.  
      <lb/>
                <lb/>These loose impressions are referred to in the index of copies as "MPI," an abbreviation for Miscellaneous Plates and Impressions. As a group, MPIs reveal Blake's creative process as it unfolded through production, providing insights and new information about designs and texts.  For example, six plates are in early states not used in published copies. Object 16 is an impression of Plate 5 in the first of two states; Objects 13, 22, and 38 are impressions of Plates 4, 9, and 17 in the first of three states; and Objects 39 and 40 are impressions of Plates 17 and 18 in the second of three states. Objects 10 and 11, impressions of Plate 2, have major motifs added by Blake in pencil, pen and ink, and gray washes. Object 5, an impression of Plate 1, the frontispiece of the “Ancient of Days,” is from the Whitworth Gallery and is in Blake’s late coloring style. Object 4, an impression of Plate 1, was printed by Blake but colored by an unknown hand. The same is true of Objects 19 and 20, impressions of Plates 6 and 7, which were trimmed of most of their texts, as were Objects 12, 18, and 21, impressions of Plates 4, 6, and 7.  
      <lb/>
                <lb/> Object 1, another impression of Plate 1, was lightly color printed by Blake; the colorist of the black wash forming the clouds, however, is questionable. Object 12, an impression of Plate 4, was color printed. Object 29, an impression of Plate 11, was heavily color printed, probably as the first pull of the plate color printed for <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> Copy B, which is in the Archive. Objects 25 and 32, impressions of Plates 10 and 12, were lightly color printed, with the latter finished in delicate washes. Objects 14, 17, 23, and 41, impressions of Plates 4, 5, 9, and 18, are posthumous, printed by Frederick Tatham, who printed <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> Copy M, c. 1832, which is in the Archive, in this reddish brown color.
      <lb/>
                <lb/> <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> Copy MPI can be accessed like plates in copies of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> and compared with impressions from the same copperplate using the "Objects from the Same Matrix" feature in the second navigation bar below the image. The Archive will gradually publish groups of miscellaneous plates and impressions for each illuminated book, which will enable users to trace the evolution of Blake's printed designs.
      <lb/>
                <lb/> The Archive now contains fully searchable and scalable digital editions of 123
                copies of Blake's nineteen illuminated books. Users may view color corrected digital
                images of Blake's works at their true size, and enlarge and rotate these images to
                examine texts and illustrations in detail. The images are accompanied by diplomatic
                transcriptions and editors' notes, as well as illustration descriptions that make it
                possible to search Blake's works for visual motifs. The Archive also provides full
                bibliographic and provenance information for each digital edition it publishes. 
      <lb/>
                <lb/> As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access
                restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible by the
                University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with the University of Rochester, the
                continuing support of the Library of Congress, and the cooperation of the
                international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us
                permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive. </updatestmt>

The printing of Objects 27 and 38 (Bentley Plates 11 and 17) recto/verso, also found in proof Copy a, may indicate an early version of *Europe* with a plate sequence in which Plate 17 follows Plate 11.  A. W. J. Lincoln, "Blake's 'Europe': An Early Version?," *Notes and Queries* n.s. 25.3 (1978): 213, suggests that proof Copy a is this early version.  For further discussion see Alexander S. Gourlay, "Philip D. Sherman's Blakes at Brown University," *Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly* 28.3 (winter 1994-95): 94-99.</note></numberleaves>

                    <illusobjdesc>An old, nude, but muscular man with long hair and beard squats
                        within a circle, perhaps meant to represent the disc of the sun. His hair
                        and beard extend horizontally to the left, as though blown by a strong wind
                        from right to left. His left leg is bent at the knee, with both left knee
                        and left foot prominent. His right leg is kneeling, with the lower leg bent
                        back, knee touching the edge of the circle. He is hunched over and looks
                        down or has his eyes closed; his left arm is extended down. He holds a pair
                        of dividers or compasses in his left hand, with his forefinger spread away
                        from his other fingers. Slight indications of a robe or some sort of drapery
                        appear just right of the figure's left foot. Beams of light emanate from the
                        circle, surrounded by clouds except where the man's arm extends downward.
                        The dramatic shading on the clouds and the bright light behind the figure
                        suggest either sunrise or sunset or, alternatively, the sky after a storm.
                        The figure is very probably Urizen in the act of creating and/or
                        circumscribing the material universe. This design, perhaps Blake's most
                        famous, has also been titled by critics &quot;The Ancient of Days&quot; and

                    <illusobjdesc>An old, nude, but muscular man with long hair and beard squats
                        within a circle, perhaps meant to represent the disc of the sun. His hair
                        and beard extend horizontally to the left, as though blown by a strong wind
                        from right to left. His left leg is bent at the knee, with both left knee
                        and left foot prominent. His right leg is kneeling, with the lower leg bent
                        back, knee touching the edge of the circle. He is hunched over and looks
                        down or has his eyes closed; his left arm is extended down. He holds a pair
                        of dividers or compasses in his left hand, with his forefinger spread away
                        from his other fingers. Slight indications of a robe or some sort of drapery
                        appear just right of the figure's left foot. Beams of light emanate from the
                        circle, surrounded by clouds except where the man's arm extends downward.
                        The dramatic shading on the clouds and the bright light behind the figure
                        suggest either sunrise or sunset or, alternatively, the sky after a storm.
                        The figure is very probably Urizen in the act of creating and/or
                        circumscribing the material universe. This design, perhaps Blake's most

Bentley page 109, "Ancient of Days" Copy F, records the inscription as "Blake 1827."  This impression has often been identified as the one Blake richly colored shortly before his death in 1827; see the accounts by J. T. Smith and Frederick Tatham in Bentley, *Records*, pages 620-21 (Smith) and 682 (Tatham).  The printing date of the underlying relief-etched image is probably 1794 when Blake was printing many plates for *Europe*.  The state of the plate cannot be determined with any certainty, because of the rich hand coloring that obscures most of the underlying printed image, but it is probably in the second state (of two).</p></objnote>

                        and left foot prominent. His right leg is kneeling, with the lower leg bent
                        back, knee touching the edge of the circle. He is hunched over and looks
                        down or has his eyes closed; his left arm is extended down. He holds a pair
                        of dividers or compasses in his left hand, with his forefinger spread away
                        from his other fingers. Slight indications of a robe or some sort of drapery
                        appear just right of the figure's left foot. Distinct rays of light appear
                        to emanate from behind the lower half of the disc; the sky behind the top
                        half is suffused with light. The disc is surrounded by clouds except where
                        the man's arm extends downwards. The dramatic shading on the clouds and the

                        alternatively, the sky after a storm. The figure is very probably Urizen in
                        the act of creating and/or circumscribing the material universe. This

                    <illusobjdesc>The pictorial image is treated as a full-plate design. A nude
                        figure, presumably male, kneels facing out from the plate, arms bent and
                        resting on the ground just above the imprint. His posture suggests a bowed
                        head but instead a giant snake emerges from where his neck meets his
                        shoulders. This snake rises above and to the left of the kneeling figure;
                        its upper body reaches upward in two loops, suggesting a spiral, with its
                        head facing to the right. A small crest rises from the top of its head. Its
                        mouth is open; both its long, forked tongue and teeth are prominent. The
                        snake's body is patterned with repeating ovals and lines that suggest
                        texture or scales. In other versions of this plate, the serpent's body
                        extends beyond the lower right margin of the plate and then returns under
                        the imprint, with its tail ending below "Blake" (line 5) in the imprint. In
                        this image, however, the two large coils of the serpent's lower body have
                        been removed and replaced with the nude figure. These loops are still
                        lightly visible behind the nude drawing. Below the left arm of the figure
                        and right of "Lambeth" (line 4) in the imprint are some vegetative forms
                        with leaves; the same vegetation also protrudes from beneath the snake in
                        the bottom left corner of the plate. In the lower right corner, the
                        serpentine form with a single loop representing the snake's tail in other
                        copies is visible and here resembles a vine or other vegetation. The dark
                        coloring along the lower edge of the image may suggest earth. In other

                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>A gowned and bearded old man, presumably Urizen, sits on the
                        massive head of a serpent who faces right. The man’s body is twisted so that
                        his legs are extended to the left along the snake’s head, but his upper body
                        faces forward. The man looks up and to the right; he is holding a quill in
                        his left hand and tablets in his right. His left foot is braced against the
                        body of the snake, which extends upward along the left margin of the image.
                        Its body reaches upward in two loops, suggesting a spiral; its tail ends in
                        trailing lines, echoing the form descending from the final E in "EUROPE"
                        (line 2). A crest rises from the top of its head, upon which Urizen is
                        seated. The serpent's mouth is open; it seems to be holding or eating
                        something large in its mouth. Curling lines above suggest waves or clouds.
                        The pattern of ovals and lines on the snake's body suggests scales. The
                        snake may be the serpent-form of Orc. The gray wash underneath the serpent's
                        head, which nearly obscures the imprint, suggests ground or stormy seas.
                        Traces of what may be vines or vegetation emerge to the left and right of
                        the serpent's head, as well as extend from the bottom right of the plate to
                        just below the imprint. This vegetation has been nearly obscured by the gray
                        wash, however. At the top of the image, either emerging from the individual
                        R, O, P, and E of "EUROPE" or from behind those letters, are sketchy shapes
                        that may be the rough forms of angels. The shape trailing from the final E
                        is most clearly figurative, and it may have long hair trailing behind its
                        head.  In this image, the original title plate for *Europe: A
                        Prophecy* has been significantly modified. While the coils of the
                        serpent's body to the left of the plate are printed from the copperplate, Blake has switched the
                        serpent's head and tail. Traces of the original printed image are lightly visible to
                        the right of "a" (line 3), underneath the serpent's head, and behind the
                        gray wash at the bottom of the plate.</illusobjdesc>

                            right of the panel; his mouth may be open. He is holding a quill in his
                            left hand and tablets in his right. His left arm is bent at a 90 degree
                            angle; his right arm is hidden behind the tablets he is holding. His
                            left foot is braced against the body of the snake and his right foot may
                            be crossed under the left and visible below it.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>A serpent carries an old man upon the crest of his giant head.
                            The snake is facing right, and one eye is visible. Its mouth is open,
                            with lower jaw possibly distinguishable behind the gray wash at the
                            bottom of the plate. It appears to be holding or eating a large
                            indeterminate object in its jaws, and curled lines above its nostrils
                            suggest smoke or clouds. The serpent's body rises up and along the left
                            side of the plate in two loops, suggesting a spiral. The serpent's body
                            is patterned with repeated ovals and lines that suggest scales. The
                            lower spiral obscures the bottom left corner of Urizen's tablets. Its
                            forked tail crosses the plate and trails off into two lines at the top
                            right corner of the plate, above Urizen's head. Lightly visible behind
                            the serpent's tail is the head of the serpent from the original
                            printing. This figure may be the serpent-form of Orc, the
                            personification of revolutionary energy.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This impression includes only the design above the plate. Two figures appear in a landscape. A nude male sits crouching in a
                        contracted posture within a cave surrounded at its mouth with large stones.
                        His legs are drawn up and crossed at the ankles. He faces to the left,
                        toward the other figure. His arms are bent upward at the elbows, with his
                        left forearm and index finger pointing up. He grasps a knife or dagger in
                        his right hand. He may be an assassin, contemplating the murder of the
                        figure to the left. This figure on the left is a youthful male wearing
                        tights, a hat, a bundle or backpack on his back, and belts over his chest.
                        He strides forward and to the left. He faces left and holds a walking stick
                        in his right hand. His left arm is bent at the elbow, with his left forearm
                        and hand behind his back. He looks to the left, perhaps at something out of
                        the frame, and his mouth is slightly open. He is probably one of Blake's
                        representations of a traveler. Below his feet is a path or road that wraps
                        around the bottom of the rocks and cave. Vegetation, perhaps the leaves of
                        trees or a hedge, grows right and left of this walking figure, and above the
                        cave with the assassin. There is additional vegetation with leaves above the
                        cave and at the bottom left of its entrance. Gray sky is visible in the
                        upper left corner and across the top of the plate.</illusobjdesc>

                        its mouth with large stones. His legs are drawn up and crossed at the

                        hand pointing up. He grasps a knife or dagger in his right hand. He may be
                        an assassin, contemplating the murder of the figure to the left. This figure
                        on the left is a youthful male wearing tights, a hat, a bundle or backpack
                        on his back, and belts over his chest. He strides forward and to the left.
                        He faces left and holds a walking stick in his right hand. His left arm is

                        is additional vegetation with leaves above the cave and to the left of its
                        entrance. Some flame-like shapes at the bottom right of the cave entrance
                        might be leaves of additional vegetation, or may be shadowy grooves in the

                            bent at the elbow, with his left forearm and hand behind his back. He
                            steps forward with his right foot, which is prominent. His hair is short
                            and blows behind him in flame-like locks. He looks to the left, perhaps
                            at something out of the frame, and his mouth may be slightly open. He is
                            probably one of Blake's representations of a traveler.</illusobjdesc>

                <illustration type="interlinear" location="CD">
                    <illusobjdesc>There is a good deal of interlinear decoration, particularly in
                        the margins of the text. Most consists of vines and leaves, but there are
                        also a few animals. The first letter of the first word in line 2 ("The")
                        twists into a spiral vine on the left with three loops; it (or another,
                        detached vine) descends with one further loop in the left margin to line 10.
                        A long, wavy vine extends between lines 4 and 5. On it is a long-legged
                        spider, just above "other sons" in line 5. Further to the left, under the
                        first word of line 4, is a small form that may be a fly, moth, butterfly, or
                        bee. A vine trails downward from this same first word ("And") in line 4.
                        Just left of the beginning of line 13 is a flying creature, perhaps an
                        insect of some sort. In the bottom left corner of the plate, a vine descends
                        from the first letter of the first word ("And") in the last line of text
                        (line 16). In the right margin, another branch of the vine extending between
                        lines 4 and 5 descends from the design above the text all the way to the
                        lower margin. It bears loops, at least two types of leaves, and perhaps some
                        fruit or flowers. A butterfly sits on the upper reaches of this vine
                        (opposite line 4); a worm or caterpillar inches its way across the upper
                        reaches of a large, slender leaf opposite the space between lines 8 and 9.
                        Other branches of this vine extend above the falling figure and intertwine
                        with the large leaf to the right of this same figure. To the right are two
                        flying birds. A separate vine with spiky leaves twists right of lines 5-7,
                        growing from the "d" in "thunder" (line 8). Below one of its tendrils, and
                        just to the right of line 8, is a flying insect, perhaps a beetle or fly. A
                        somewhat jagged vine extends horizontally following line 7; to the right is
                        another vine, growing from the top of the second letter of "of" in line 8.
                        Far to the right of lines 14-15, between the long leaves and the edge of the
                        plate, are two flying birds.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Two figures appear in the landscape above the text. A partially
                        nude male sits crouching in a contracted posture within a cave surrounded at
                        its mouth with large stones. His legs are drawn up and crossed at the
                        ankles. He faces to the left, toward the other figure. His arms are bent
                        upward at the elbows, with his left forearm and index finger on his left
                        hand pointing up. He grasps a knife or dagger in his right hand. He may be
                        an assassin, contemplating the murder of the figure to the left. This figure
                        on the left is a youthful male wearing tights, a hat, a bundle or backpack
                        on his back, and belts over his chest. He strides forward and to the left.
                        He faces left and holds a walking stick in his right hand. His left arm is
                        bent at the elbow, with his left forearm and hand behind his back. He looks
                        to the left, perhaps at something out of the frame, and his mouth may be
                        slightly open. He is probably one of Blake's representations of a traveler.
                        Below his feet is a path or road that wraps around the bottom of the rocks
                        and cave. Vegetation, perhaps the leaves of trees or a hedge, grows right
                        and left of this walking figure, and above the cave with the assassin. There
                        is additional vegetation with leaves above the cave and to the left of its
                        entrance. Dark flame-like forms that suggest more leaves or shadows are
                        visible to the right of the cave entrance as well, or they may be shadowy
                        grooves in the rock face.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Below the text, we see a human (and apparently) male head, facing
                        directly at us, with a pained or despairing expression. This head seems to
                        be surrounded tightly by the figure's arms and snake-like drapery. The ends
                        of this drapery curve over the head and to the left, where it forms two
                        loops. The figure seems to be flying on its large, bat-like wings. At least
                        ten birds fly near the figure, above him and below and to the right of his

                        bent at the knees, with the left leg drawn up near his chest. His arms are
                        raised over his head and bent at the elbows with his hands behind his head.
                        A large weight is attached to his hands or arms, apparently with a single
                        link of a chain that disappears behind his head (because attached to his
                        hands?). This weight apparently pulls him downwards.</illusobjdesc>

                            both cheeks). Alternatively, the face may be deeply lined with wrinkles
                            indicating advanced age. This head seems to be surrounded tightly by the
                            figure's arms and snake-like drapery. The ends of this drapery curve
                            over the head and to the left, where it forms two loops. The figure
                            seems to be flying on its large, bat-like wings.</illusobjdesc>

                <illustration type="interlinear" location="CD">
                    <illusobjdesc>There is a good deal of interlinear decoration, particularly in
                        the margins of the text. Most consists of vines and leaves, but there are
                        also a few animals. The first letter of the first word in line 2 ("The")
                        twists into a spiral vine on the left; it (or another, detached vine)
                        descends with one further loop in the left margin to line 10. A long, wavy
                        vine extends between lines 4 and 5. On it is a long-legged spider, just
                        above "other sons" in line 5. Further to the left, under the first word of
                        line 4, is a small form that may be a fly, moth, butterfly, or bee. A vine
                        trails downward from this same first word ("And") in line 4. Just left of
                        the beginning of line 13 is a flying creature, perhaps an insect of some
                        sort. In the bottom left corner of the plate, a vine descends from the first
                        letter of the first word ("And") in the last line of text (line 16). In the
                        right margin, another branch of the vine extending between lines 4 and 5
                        descends from the design above the text all the way to the lower margin. It
                        bears loops, at least two types of leaves, and perhaps some fruit or
                        flowers. A butterfly sits on the upper reaches of this vine (opposite line
                        4); a worm or caterpillar inches its way across the upper reaches of a
                        large, slender leaf opposite the space between lines 8 and 9. Other branches
                        of this vine extend above the falling figure and intertwine with the large
                        leaf to the right of this same figure. To the right are two flying birds. A
                        separate vine twists right of lines 5-7, beginning just above the "d" in
                        "thunder" (line 8) and dividing into two spiky leaves. Below one of its
                        tendrils, and just to the right of line 8, is a flying insect, perhaps a
                        beetle or fly. A somewhat jagged vine extends horizontally following line 7;
                        to the right is another vine, growing from the top of the second letter of
                        "of" in line 8. Far to the right of lines 14-15, between the long leaves and
                        the edge of the plate, are two flying birds.</illusobjdesc>

                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>Although containing considerable text, the plate is treated as a
                        full-page design showing four nude figures in a dark sky, perhaps at night.
                        The two text panels are shaped like clouds. Upper right, we see a figure
                        from behind with his(?) left leg drawn up and bent at the knee and his left
                        foot poised on a cloud extending down and to the left. His right leg is
                        extended backward; he may be rising. We do not see his arms, but his hands
                        clutch his head. This gesture suggests despair. Below is a group of three
                        wrestling figures, all nude and bald. The central figure has his legs
                        spread, with his left leg extended and his right drawn up and bent at the
                        knee with his right foot below his prominent (if somewhat abstractly
                        rendered) genitals. He looks down and to the right. With his right arm he
                        grasps another bald nude around the neck, apparently in an attempt to
                        strangle him. This central figure's left arm is bent at the elbow and he
                        grasps the neck of another bald nude with his left hand. The figure on the
                        left has his legs spread and bent at the knees. He looks up and to the right
                        and tries, with both hands, to release the central male's arm from around
                        his neck. The wrestler on the right has his legs spread, with his left leg
                        extended vertically and his right leg bent at the knee. His arms are bent
                        back over his shoulders and grasp the left leg of the central male. All
                        three figures have caricature-like facial expressions suggesting fear and
                        pain (figures right and left) or desperation and cruelty (central figure).
                        The dark background surrounding the struggling figures suggests a night
                        scene.</illusobjdesc>

                            cloud. We do not see his arms, but his hands clutch his head and short,
                            curly hair. This gesture suggests despair. His muscular back and
                            buttocks are prominent.</illusobjdesc>

                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>Although containing considerable text, the plate is treated as a
                        full-page design showing four nude figures in a dark sky, perhaps at night.
                        The two text panels are shaped like clouds. Upper right, we see a figure
                        from behind with his(?) left leg drawn up and bent and his left foot poised
                        on a cloud extending down and to the left. His right leg is extended
                        backward; he may be rising. We do not see his arms, but his hands clutch his
                        head. This gesture suggests despair. Below is a group of three wrestling
                        figures, all nude and bald. The central figure has his legs spread, with his
                        left leg extended and his right drawn up and bent at the knee with his right
                        foot below his prominent (if somewhat abstractly rendered) genitals. He
                        looks down and to the right. With his right arm he grasps another bald nude
                        around the neck, apparently in an attempt to strangle him. This central
                        figure's left arm is bent at the elbow and he grasps the neck of another
                        bald nude with his left hand. The figure on the left has his legs spread and
                        bent at the knees. He looks up and to the right and tries, with both hands,
                        to release the central male's arm from around his neck. The wrestler on the
                        right has his legs spread, with his left leg extended vertically and his
                        right leg bent at the knee. His arms are bent back over his shoulders and
                        grasp the left leg of the central male. All three figures have
                        caricature-like facial expressions suggesting fear and pain (figures right
                        and left) or desperation and cruelty (central figure). The dark background
                        surrounding the four struggling figures suggests a night
                        scene.</illusobjdesc>

                            We do not see his arms, but his hands clutch his head and short, curly
                            hair. This gesture suggests despair. His muscular back and buttocks are
                            prominent.</illusobjdesc>

                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>Although containing considerable text, the plate is treated as a
                        full-page design showing four nude figures in a dark sky, perhaps at night.
                        The two text panels are shaped like clouds. Upper right, we see a figure
                        from behind with his(?) left leg drawn up and bent at the knee and his left
                        foot poised on cloud extending down and to the left. His right leg is
                        extended backward; he may be rising. We do not see his arms, but his hands
                        clutch his head. This gesture suggests despair. Below is a group of three
                        wrestling figures, all nude and bald. The central figure has his legs
                        spread, with his left leg extended and his right drawn up and bent at the
                        knee with his right foot below his prominent (if somewhat abstractly
                        rendered) genitals. He looks down and to the right. With his right arm he
                        grasps another bald nude around the neck, apparently in an attempt to
                        strangle him. This central figure's left arm is bent at the elbow and he
                        grasps the neck of another bald nude with his left hand. The figure on the
                        left has his legs spread and bent at the knees. He looks up and to the right
                        and tries, with both hands, to release the central male's arm from around
                        his neck. The wrestler on the right has his legs spread, with his left leg
                        extended vertically and his right leg bent at the knee. His arms are bent
                        back over his shoulders and grasp the left leg of the central male. All
                        three figures have caricature-like facial expressions with slightly open
                        mouths suggesting fear and pain (figures right and left) or desperation and
                        cruelty (central figure). The dark background surrounding the struggling
                        figures suggests a night scene.</illusobjdesc>

                            curly hair. This gesture suggests despair. His muscular back and
                            buttocks are prominent.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This impression has been cropped from one that contains a good deal of
                        text and a great deal of interlinear decoration, in addition to major
                        pictorial motifs that constitute a full-plate design. The text panels are
                        shaped like, and may represent, clouds floating in the sky. The largest
                        figure, hovering horizontally in the air is a gowned female. Her body is
                        twisted, facing forward at her hips and facing down above the waist. Her
                        long, curled hair cascades over (and hence obscures) her face. Her arms are
                        bent at the elbows and she holds the back of her head with her hands. In the
                        context of this poem, she has been identified as Enitharmon, a nature
                        goddess of fallen time and space. Below her cascading hair is a nude male(?)
                        in a contracted posture. He seems confined by the circle in which he sits.
                        This circle may be meant to represent a globe; it has been described as a
                        comet, although there is no tail. It may be a planet. His legs are bent at
                        the knees and drawn up to his chest; his arms are bent at the elbows with
                        his hands, formed into fists, against his cheeks just below his eyes. He
                        faces forward. Flames surround him within the globe. This may be Orc, the
                        spirit of revolution here confined, the "secret child" (of Enitharmon?)
                        mentioned on the plate (line 2), or one of Enitharmon's "vig'rous progeny of
                        fires" (plates 15-17, line 8). The other motifs on this plate, including
                        many human figures, will be treated as interlinear designs.</illusobjdesc>

                        female figure. Her body faces to the left. Her left arm extends downward to
                        her knee, but her head seems to be turned to the right so that we see her
                        head and shoulders from behind. Her right arm is raised at about 135 degrees

                    <illusobjdesc>This impression shows only a top portion of the full plate design.
                        The header text and a portion of one major pictorial motif are present. The
                        largest figure, hovering horizontally in the air just below the heading, is
                        a gowned female. The hem of her garment forms a snake-like tail at left. Her
                        body is twisted, facing forward below the waist and facing down above the
                        waist, although much of her upper body is not depicted as it is below the
                        lower margin of the design. However, her hands protrude from the bottom edge
                        of the plate and are clasped behind her head. She has large wings, and thus
                        may be an angel. More specifically, in the context of this poem, she has
                        been identified as Enitharmon, a nature goddess of fallen time and space,
                        and as the "nameless shadowy female" (plates 13 and 14 line 2) who wraps a
                        "turban of thick clouds" around her "lab'ring head" (plates 13 and 14 line
                        13). The pink coloring of the sky and clouds may suggest sunrise or sunset.
                        The other motifs on this plate, including many human figures, will be
                        treated as interlinear designs.</illusobjdesc>

                <illustration type="interlinear" location="AB">
                    <illusobjdesc>The heading is surrounded by several figures and vegetative
                        motifs. The figures, particularly the larger ones, may be the "sons &amp;
                        daughters" (line 8) of Enitharmon referred to on complete copies of the
                        plate. The lower left corner of "A" (in "A / PROPHECY" [lines 1-2]) grows
                        into a long vine with branches. Standing on this vine, near the left foot of
                        the letter, is a human figure. His or her arms, raised vertically, grow into
                        limbs of a tree that bend downwards, as with a willow. The motif suggests
                        the classical myth of Daphne and her vegetating metamorphosis. This parallel
                        suggests that the figure is female. On the right foot of "A" is a tree,
                        possibly a palm, with branches that bend downward. To the left of the "A"
                        and slightly below it is a male(?) embracing a female. Both hover in the
                        air, with the male on the right and facing to the left. Both have long hair
                        and the male appears nude, while the woman has a long, snake-like tail of
                        drapery extending from her lower torso. The man's body is twisted into a
                        left-facing curve, seen from behind. His left arm is raised horizontally and
                        embraces the woman's waist. His right leg is extended horizontally. We also
                        see the woman from behind, with her body twisted into a curve matching the
                        man's. Both her arms are raised horizontally, with her head facing down.
                        These gestures suggest that she is trying to escape from the man. In
                        contrast, the couple right of the letter "A" is embracing mutually and
                        appear to be kissing. The winged male(?), possibly an angel, hovers
                        horizontally in the air, with his arms raised at 45 degrees to embrace the
                        woman(?) who hovers vertically. She too is winged and may be an angel. Her
                        legs are bent back and her arms raised at 135 degrees to embrace her
                        companion. He faces down and to the left; she faces up and to the right.
                        Below the "A" is a hunched over, and apparently gowned, figure facing to the
                        left. This extremely contracted figure, with his or her upper body and head
                        bent down to touch the upper legs, sits on a cloud outline. Other cloud
                        outlines extend to the upper right and below "PROPHECY" in the heading. On
                        the right, below a cloud outline and above the last letter of "PROPHECY,"
                        two nude figures seen from behind soar in the sky, left arms raised
                        horizontally and right arms raised at 135 degrees. The letters of "PROPHECY"
                        are well decorated with eight human figures and vines. Proceeding from left
                        to right, these include a vine with leaves or lily-like flowers intertwined
                        with the first letter and extending to the second. A small standing figure
                        holds the vertical of the first "P" and may be climbing. Another figure
                        stands on the foot of the vertical of the "R" and faces to the left with
                        arms raised vertically. Above this figure is a small form that may be a
                        descending child or infant, arms stretched downward toward the adult. The
                        right foot of the "R" bears a very small seated figure, hunched over and
                        facing to the right. The letter "O" has two vines with lily-like flowers.
                        Standing within the "O" is a figure facing forward and with left arm raised
                        horizontally to hold a shepherd's crook. To the right of this shepherd is a
                        small flock of sheep. Three vines, or perhaps flames, spring from the foot
                        of the second "P." A vine, perhaps with a few leaves, is intertwined with
                        the next three letters ("HEC"). The final vine in this group springs from
                        the foot of the final letter and forms a spiral above and to the right of
                        the letter. This "Y" also bears three human figures. One, seen from behind
                        and with legs spread and arms raised vertically, seems to be climbing, with
                        the right foot on the foot of the "Y" and the left foot on the "C." Above,
                        standing on the top left end of the "Y," is a figure facing left who may
                        walk to the left with one leg extended backward. Finally, the first bend in
                        the vine growing from the right side of the final letter bears a seated
                        figure facing right, with back slightly hunched over and right arm extended
                        to the right knee. This figure holds a book or tablet and is probably
                        reading. Two flames, or perhaps a flame-like plant, spring from the foot of
                        the "Y" on its right side.</illusobjdesc>

                        figure, and animals. Right of lines 5-8 of the text, a nude male seems to be
                        falling through the air. His body is twisted dramatically at the waist, with
                        his legs together, his head down, and his arms raised and wrapped around his
                        head. His head is uncolored in this copy, and he may be bald. Right of line
                        2 are four flying creatures. Reading left to right, these are a bird(?), a
                        winged insect (perhaps a beetle, dragonfly, or moth), a butterfly or moth,
                        and a bird. Another winged creature, perhaps an insect, flies right of lines
                        5-6. Left and right of this creature are two vines; the vine on the right
                        looks very worm-like. A vine below line 7 includes one loop and a grain
                        tassel on its right end. A grasshopper or locust stands on this vine, facing
                        right. Three winged insects fly above the grain tassel. Another vine appears
                        further to the right, with at least one leaf and three loops. Vines, or
                        extensions of a cloud outline, extend below line 12. A bird flies on
                        extended wings above the first word ("Then") in line 15 and a vine grows
                        from the "h" of the next word ("Enitharmon").</illusobjdesc>

                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>This impression shows only the design below the text. The design consists of two large figures and five smaller ones; in
                        other copies, text appears in clouds above the figures. A nude and youthful
                        male lies prone on the ground—or perhaps on a bed of straw. He faces down,
                        with his arms bent upward and his head resting on them. Only part of his
                        left arm and right hand are visible. His hair is curly, and a halo of fire
                        surrounds his head. This is probably the youthful Orc. Above him, a nude
                        female with long, flame-like hair kneels on a cloud and leans dramatically
                        to the left. Her left leg is extended and her right bent at the knee under
                        her torso. Her arms are extended vertically above her head and she holds,
                        and apparently lifts with both hands, a cloak, blanket, or heavy drapery to
                        uncover the youth below, at whom she is looking. She is probably Enitharmon.
                        The five much smaller figures above may be her sons and daughters. In the
                        left corner of the design, we see a nude figure lying supine on a cloud with
                        legs bent and spread, body twisted to the left, head apparently down. The
                        gender of this figure is uncertain; his or her posture suggests erotic
                        exhaustion. Similar exhaustion is indicated by the nude figure to the right.
                        This figure is probably female and also lies supine on a cloud. Her body is
                        bent back, with her head, right arm, and right leg dangling downward. Above
                        and to the right is another nude female, sitting or reclining supine on a
                        cloud with her upper body propped up with her bent right arm. She faces
                        right and probably has long hair. Her right leg is extended to the right and
                        her left leg bent at the knee. Further to the right is an embracing couple
                        hovering in the air, with the woman on the right. They may be kissing. The
                        nude male, facing right, has his legs spread and his right arm raised
                        horizontally. The female, facing left, is gowned—or at least has a tail of
                        drapery curling over her raised left leg. Her legs are spread apart. Her
                        long hair may be gathered into a bun.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The setting is an enclosed interior space with a visible floor and
                        back wall. A fireplace with a grate and an arched top is at the center of
                        the back wall and of the composition. A coal fire burns on the grate. Above
                        is a large cooking pot with a handle suspended from the top of the fireplace
                        by a short rod. Clouds of smoke or steam billow above the pot. In the
                        foreground are three figures. On the left is a gowned woman, facing right
                        and in an extremely contracted posture. She sits or squats on the floor with
                        her legs drawn up to her chest and her right arm wrapped around her right
                        knee. Her head is down between her knees; her long hair cascades to the
                        ground beside her prominent right foot. The gowned woman on the right sits
                        in an elegant, neoclassical chair (though the style of the chair is clearer
                        in other copies). Her prominent knees are drawn up toward her chest, with
                        legs crossed. Her left hand is visible near her right breast. She wears a
                        necklace of beads and faces up with a worried or pained expression, perhaps
                        looking at the pot. Below the woman in the chair is a male child, nude,
                        rigid, and lying supine on a white cloth spread on the floor. His eyes may
                        be open but he is probably dead. His hair is curly. Some interpreters have
                        described this design as a scene of famine, including the contemplation of
                        cannibalism by the woman above the child's corpse.</illusobjdesc>

                        foreground are three figures. On the left is a gowned woman, facing right
                        and in an extremely contracted posture. She sits or squats on the floor with
                        her legs drawn up to her chest and her right arm wrapped around her right
                        knee. Her head is down between her knees; her long hair cascades to the
                        ground beside her prominent right foot. The gowned woman on the right sits
                        in an elegant, neoclassical chair (though the style of the chair is clearer
                        in other copies). Her prominent knees are drawn up toward her chest, with
                        legs crossed. Her left hand is visible near her right breast. She wears a
                        necklace of beads and faces up with a worried or pained expression, perhaps
                        looking at the pot. Below the woman in the chair is a male child, nude,
                        rigid, and lying supine on a white cloth spread on the floor. His eyes may
                        be open but he is probably dead. His hair is curly. Some interpreters have
                        described this design as a scene of famine, including the contemplation of
                        cannibalism by the woman above the child's corpse.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The background of the design is composed of a brick wall with a
                        large wooden door. The closed door is inscribed "LORD [H]AVE MERC[Y] ON US"
                        with a cross below the inscription. Left of the door is a standing, and
                        perhaps walking, figure wearing a heavy black coat. He faces left, looks
                        down with a worried expression, and wears a large and dark bicorn hat. His
                        left arm is at his side and he holds a large bell in his left hand. This
                        bellman can be associated with the theme of plague dominating the design
                        (particularly when coupled with the inscription on the door, which was
                        typical of quarantined houses). Since his mouth is slightly open, he may be
                        calling out, "Bring out your dead!" Below the bellman on the left are a man
                        and woman. The man, wearing a gown or at least a shirt, appears against the
                        left margin of the plate in profile, facing right and down, and perhaps
                        holds the woman with his right arm. His hair is curly. The gowned woman sits
                        on the ground, with her upper body propped up by the man. Her hair is long
                        and her arms are at her side. Her face, with mouth open like her
                        companion’s, expresses despair and perhaps pain, and the limp posture of her
                        body indicates that she may be weak with plague. To the right, a gowned
                        woman with long hair seems to be falling on her knees. Her arms are raised
                        vertically as if in supplication, with the fingers of both hands spread
                        apart. She faces up, with her head bent back; like her companions, she has
                        an expression of pain or despair possibly indicative of the
                        plague.</illusobjdesc>

                            background, typical of what was written on the doors of quarantined
                            houses during the great plague of London in 1665.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The background of the design is composed of a brick wall with a
                        large wooden door. The closed door is inscribed "LORD [H]AVE MERC[Y] ON US"
                        with a cross below the inscription. Left of the door is a standing, and
                        perhaps walking, figure wearing a heavy black coat. He faces left, looks
                        down with a worried expression, and wears a large and dark bicorn hat. His
                        left arm is at his side and he holds a large bell in his left hand. This
                        bellman can be associated with the theme of plague dominating the design
                        (particularly when coupled with the inscription on the door, which was
                        typical of quarantined houses). Since his mouth is slightly open, he may be
                        calling out, "Bring out your dead!" Below the bellman on the left are a man
                        and woman. The man, wearing a gown or at least a shirt, appears against the
                        left margin of the plate in profile, facing right and down, and perhaps
                        holds the woman with his right arm. His hair is curly. The gowned woman sits
                        on the ground, with her upper body propped up by the man. Her hair is long
                        and her arms are at her side. Her face, with mouth open like her
                        companion’s, expresses despair and perhaps pain, and the limp posture of her
                        body indicates that she may be weak with plague. To the right, a gowned
                        woman with long hair seems to be falling on her knees. Her arms are raised
                        vertically as if in supplication, with the fingers of both hands spread
                        apart. She faces up, with her head bent back; like her companions, she has
                        an expression of pain or despair possibly indicative of the
                        plague.</illusobjdesc>

                            background, typical of what was written on the doors of quarantined
                            houses during the great plague of London in 1665.</illusobjdesc>

                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>The background of the design is composed of a brick wall with a
                        large wooden door. The closed door is inscribed "LORD [H]AVE MERC[Y] ON US"
                        with a cross below the inscription. Left of the door is a standing, and
                        perhaps walking, figure wearing a heavy, black coat. He faces left, looks
                        down with a worried expression, and wears a large and dark bicorn hat. His
                        left arm is at his side and he holds a large bell in his left hand. This
                        bellman can be associated with the theme of plague dominating the design
                        (particularly when coupled with the inscription on the door, which was
                        typical of quarantined houses). Since his mouth is slightly open, he may be
                        calling out, "Bring out your dead!" Below the bellman on the left are a man
                        and woman. The man, wearing a gown or at least a shirt, appears against the
                        left margin of the plate in profile, facing right and down, and perhaps
                        holds the woman with his right arm. His hair is curly. The gowned woman sits
                        on the ground, with her upper body propped up by the man. Her hair is long
                        and her arms are at her side. Her face, with mouth open like her
                        companion’s, expresses despair and perhaps pain, and the limp posture of her
                        body indicates that she may be weak with plague. To the right, a gowned
                        woman with long hair seems to be falling on her knees. Her arms are raised
                        vertically as if in supplication, with the fingers of both hands spread
                        apart. She faces up, with her head bent back; like her companions, she has
                        an expression of pain or despair possibly indicative of the
                        plague.</illusobjdesc>

                            background, typical of what was written on the doors of quarantined
                            houses during the great plague of London in 1665.</illusobjdesc>

                        very dark, perhaps stormy, environment. A gowned and elderly male with long
                        hair and beard stands on the right facing to the left. His arms are raised
                        horizontally, with palms outward (that is, facing to the left). His worried
                        expression, staring eyes, and arm gesture suggest that he is afraid of some
                        unpictured presence to the left. He may be Albion's Angel, frightened at the
                        prospect of coming revolution. A gowned woman kneels on the ground before
                        the old man, with right leg extended backward and left leg bent at the knee.
                        Her body is bent forward and her head down. Her right arm is raised
                        horizontally and she embraces the old man around his legs; her right hand
                        seems to press upon the old man’s buttocks. Her long, curly hair cascades
                        below her right upper arm. She may be supplicating the man for help. Forms
                        in the background suggests dark clouds or smoke, illuminated from the left.
                        Perhaps the unpictured presence to the left is the fires of revolution. The
                        darkness left and right suggests a night scene. </illusobjdesc>

                        very dark, perhaps stormy, environment. A gowned and elderly male with long
                        hair and beard stands on the right facing to the left. His arms are raised
                        horizontally, with palms outward (that is, facing to the left). His worried
                        expression, staring eyes, and arm gesture suggest that he is afraid of some
                        unpictured presence to the left. He may be Albion's Angel, frightened at the
                        prospect of coming revolution. A gowned woman kneels on the ground before
                        the old man, with right leg extended backward and left leg bent at the knee.
                        Her body is bent forward and her head down. Her right arm is raised
                        horizontally and she embraces the old man around his legs; her right hand
                        seems to press upon the old man’s buttocks. Her long, curly hair cascades
                        below her right upper arm. She may be supplicating the man for help. Forms
                        in the background suggests dark clouds or smoke, illuminated from the left.
                        Perhaps the unpictured presence to the left is the fires of revolution. The
                        darkness left and right suggests a night scene. </illusobjdesc>

                        very dark, perhaps stormy, environment. A gowned and elderly male with long
                        hair and beard stands on the right facing to the left. His arms are raised
                        horizontally, with palms outward (that is, facing to the left). His worried
                        expression, staring eyes, and arm gesture suggest that he is afraid of some
                        unpictured presence to the left. He may be Albion's Angel, frightened at the
                        prospect of coming revolution. A gowned woman kneels on the ground before
                        the old man, with right leg extended backward and left leg bent at the knee.
                        Her body is bent forward and her head down. Her right arm is raised
                        horizontally and she embraces the old man around his legs; her right hand
                        seems to press upon the old man’s buttocks. Her long hair cascades below her
                        right upper arm. She may be supplicating the man for help. The background
                        for the figures suggests dark clouds or smoke; the red wash on the lowest
                        cloud or smoke suggests sunrise or sunset, or perhaps reflected light from
                        flames producing the smoke. Perhaps the unpictured presence to the left is
                        the fires of revolution.This may be a night scene. Coloring on the ground
                        beneath the figures suggests vegetation, perhaps grass or

                        leg is extended, his right bent at the knee as he hovers in the air. He
                        holds his coiled horn or trumpet with his left hand. Both arms are raised
                        horizontally, with the right arm extending horizontally into the grain. His

                    <illusobjdesc>A gowned male sits on a throne-like chair, the chair in turn
                        resting on a cloud. He faces forward and wears the triple-crown of a Pope.
                        His face, however, may be a caricature of George III. He holds on his lap an
                        open book. Large, bat-like wings extend from behind his arms. In some
                        copies, the figure appears to have bat-like ears that merge with the pointed
                        arches on the throne behind him. However, in this copy the figure has human
                        ears. The back of his chair resembles the facade of a Gothic church, with
                        arches and spires right and left. Below this Pope, and below the cloud, are
                        two female angels, right and left, with large wings. Both have long hair,
                        are gowned, bow and look down, and have one arm extended at 45 degrees. Each

                    <illusobjdesc>The setting is a stone prison cell with stone stairs rising on the

                        in turn attached to the stone floor with two heavy chains. The prisoner is a
                        nude male with curly hair who sits on a stone ledge. His prominent knees are
                        drawn up to his chest and his legs crossed at the ankles. His body faces
                        forward but his neck is twisted to the right; his head is back and he seems
                        to look up at the figure on the right. His arms are bent at the elbows with
                        his hands raised, palms facing the viewer and fingers spread apart. His
                        gestures and open eye indicate fear and perhaps pain; he may be crying. We
                        see the male figure on the right from behind as he ascends the stairs (right
                        leg extended backwards, left leg bent forward). Except for what may be a
                        belt around his waist, he is nude. His hair is curly. His right arm is at
                        his side. He appears to be holding something in his right hand, but the
                        print is too dark to identify the object; in other prints it is clear that
                        these are keys. He may be the other man's jailor.</illusobjdesc>

                <illustration type="interlinear" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>This text plate contains many interlinear vines, birds, insects,
                        and three snakes. Four butterflies appear right of lines 1-4. A vine
                        descends from the first letter of the first word in line 6. Two vines grow
                        from the first letter of the first word in line 9. Vines, at least two
                        birds, and what may be flames decorate the space between lines 5 and 6. A
                        butterfly and two other winged insects, two vines (one may be a worm), and
                        an odd shape that may be two moths or bats flying close together appear
                        between lines 8 and 9. A vine with multiple branches and leaves wends its
                        way through the margin right of lines 8-19. From this vine, flowers shaped
                        like Shooting Stars (Dodecatheon meadia) grow right of line 9, close to the
                        right margin of the plate, and right of line 12, below and to the left of
                        the first one. On and around this large vine are an inch worm (below the
                        last word in line 8), caterpillars (above and to the right of line 14 and
                        right of lines 9-10 and 15-16), a spider (right of line 14), and several
                        flying insects. Five flying insects (at least one a butterfly) follow line
                        11. A vine with one loop descends left of the first word in line 15. A vine
                        extends from the first letter of the first word ("My") in line 20 and
                        another vine with two loops grows from the descender of the last letter of
                        "thy" in the same line. A large bird, possibly an eagle, and three smaller
                        birds or insects fly near the right margin of the plate right of lines
                        18-20. A vine with many loops fills the considerable space between lines 20
                        and 21 and descends in the right margin to line 26. On this vine are at
                        least two large and two small caterpillars, an inch-worm, two snails, at
                        least three spiders, at least two insects with wings folded, and a bird
                        perched near the right margin with its mouth open. A second bird perches
                        within the loops of the vine, nearly obscured; facing left, it stretches
                        with mouth open toward a small worm. A large moth or butterfly appears below
                        "Antamon" in line 20. A flying insect, possibly a dragonfly, is pictured far
                        to the right of line 23. Below and to the left is a large bird (possibly an
                        eagle) soaring upwards, with a flock of at least five birds to the left. The
                        form right of lines 26-30 probably represents the sky seen through clouds
                        formed from the negative space of the page. Small vines extend up and to the
                        right from the first letters of the first words in lines 22, 26, and 32. A
                        vine descends from the second letter of "my" in line 25. A vine with leaves
                        and several branches appears right of lines 28-37. Intertwined with this
                        vine is a snake, facing to the left with its mouth open and its forked
                        tongue clearly pictured. Two other snakes, both facing left, appear in the
                        bottom margin. The right-most snake in the lower margin has a clearly
                        pictured tongue. The last letter of the last word in line 34 grows into a
                        vine. </illusobjdesc>

                <illustration type="interlinear" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>This text plate contains many interlinear vines, birds, insects,
                        and three snakes. Five butterflies appear right of lines 2-5. A vine
                        descends from the first letter of the first word in line 7. Two vines grow
                        from the first letter of the first word in line 10. Vines, at least two
                        birds, and what may be flames decorate the space between lines 6 and 7. A
                        butterfly and two other winged insects, two vines (one may be a worm), and
                        an odd shape that may be two moths or bats flying close together appear
                        between lines 9 and 10. A vine with multiple branches and leaves wends its
                        way through the margin right of lines 9-20. From this vine, flowers shaped
                        like Shooting Stars (Dodecatheon meadia) grow right of line 10, close to the
                        right margin of the plate, and right of line 13, below and to the left of
                        the first one. On and around this large vine are an inch worm (below the
                        last word in line 9), caterpillars (above and to the right of line 15 and
                        right of lines 10-11 and 16-17), a spider (right of line 15), and several
                        flying insects. Five flying insects (at least one a butterfly) follow line
                        12. A vine with one loop descends left of the first word in line 16. A vine
                        extends from the first letter of the first word ("My") in line 21 and
                        another vine with two loops grows from the descender of the last letter of
                        "thy" in the same line. A large bird, possibly an eagle, and three smaller
                        birds or insects fly near the right margin of the plate right of lines
                        19-21. A vine with many loops fills the considerable space between lines 21
                        and 22 and descends in the right margin to line 27. On this vine are at
                        least two large and two small caterpillars, an inch-worm, two snails, at
                        least three spiders, at least two insects with wings folded, and a bird
                        perched near the right margin with its mouth open. A second bird perches
                        within the loops of the vine, nearly obscured; facing left, it stretches
                        with mouth open toward a small worm. A large moth or butterfly appears below
                        "Antamon" in line 21. A flying insect, possibly a dragonfly, is pictured far
                        to the right of line 24. Below and to the left is a large bird (possibly an
                        eagle) soaring upwards, with a flock of at least five birds to the left. The
                        form right of lines 27-31 probably represents the sky seen through clouds
                        formed from the negative space of the page. Small vines extend up and to the
                        right from the first letters of the first words in lines 23, 27, and 33. A
                        vine descends from the second letter of "my" in line 26. A vine with leaves
                        and several branches appears right of lines 29-38. Intertwined with this
                        vine is a snake, facing to the left with its mouth open and its forked
                        tongue clearly pictured. Two other snakes, both facing left, appear in the
                        bottom margin. The right-most snake in the lower margin has a clearly
                        pictured tongue. The last letter of the last word in line 35 grows into a
                        vine.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Below the text, a nude, muscular male with curly hair stands with

                        the right, with his left foot on the ground. His right leg is bent at the
                        knee with his foot on one of at least two steps. He may be striding to the
                        left. His body faces forward, but his head is turned to the right. His
                        expression is fearful or pained. He may be looking at the flames forming the
                        background of the design or at the gowned young girl whose left arm he
                        grasps with his lowered left hand. Perhaps the man is her father, attempting
                        to rescue the child from the flames. We see her from behind; her right arm
                        is drawn back and raised at 135 degrees. Her left leg is extended backward;
                        she may be striding to the left. The nude male carries, over his right
                        shoulder, the limp body of a gowned woman—perhaps the child's mother. The
                        man's right arm is raised, bent at the elbow, and embraces the woman around
                        the waist. Her left arm and long hair dangle down toward the man's right
                        knee. Her gown, and presumably her legs, dangle behind the man's spread
                        legs. She may be dead or dying. Lower left, on top of the steps, is a fluted
                        and broken pillar.</illusobjdesc>

                            the knee with his foot on one of at least two stone steps. He may be
                            striding to the left. His body faces forward, but his head is turned to
                            the right. His expression is fearful or pained. He may be looking at the
                            flames forming the background of the design or at the young girl whose
                            left arm he grasps with his lowered left hand. Perhaps the man is her
                            father, attempting to rescue the child from the flames. He carries the
                            limp body of a woman over his right shoulder, holding her around the
                            waist with his raised and bent right arm.</illusobjdesc>

                        Three vines extend horizontally between lines 2 and 3. The vine on the left
                        includes a loop and one ivy-like leaf. The next vine to the right, which
                        extends from the horizontal descender of the "y" in "vineyards" (line 2),
                        bears two oak or grape leaves. The largest vine, furthest to the right, has
                        long, slender leaves. At least four insects, perhaps beetles and one
                        caterpillar, crawl on it; there may be a fifth insect, perhaps a
                        grasshopper, on the vine at far right. Three winged insects (some little
                        more than dots) and one butterfly (below "fury" in line 2) fly above the
                        vine, with three more dots that might be winged insects flying below the
                        vine just left of the right margin. Below "of his" in line 2, a bird perches
                        on the vine but spreads its wings as if about to fly into the air. An oak or
                        grape leaf grows into the left margin from the first letter of the first
                        word of line 3 ("The"). A vine with ivy-like leaves extends horizontally
                        between lines 8 and 9, divides into several branches in the right margin,
                        and has one branch arching back to the left at line 6. A branch bearing five
                        oak leaves and one acorn extends into the right margin following the final
                        line of text. To the right of this branch, a bird flies upward on extended
                        wings. From the first letter of the first word of line 10 ("And"), a vine
                        extends downward and almost touches the flames below. A vine with two loops
                        grows from the first letter of "FINIS" (line 12) and extends horizontally
                        above the word.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Below the text, a nude, muscular male with curly hair stands with
                        legs spread apart, his genitals clearly visible. His left leg is extended to
                        the right, with his left foot on the ground. His right leg is bent at the
                        knee with his foot on one of at least two steps. He may be striding to the
                        left. His body faces forward, but his head is turned to the right. His
                        expression is fearful or pained. He may be looking at the flames forming the
                        background of the design or at the young gowned girl whose left arm he
                        grasps with his lowered left hand. Perhaps the man is her father, attempting
                        to rescue the child from the flames. We see her from behind; her right arm
                        is drawn back and raised at 135 degrees. Her left leg is extended backward;
                        she may be striding to the left. The nude male carries, over his right
                        shoulder, the limp body of a gowned woman—perhaps the child's mother. The
                        man's right arm is raised, bent at the elbow, and embraces the woman around
                        the waist. Her left arm and long hair dangle down toward the man's right
                        knee. Her gown, and presumably her legs, dangle behind the man's spread
                        legs. She may be dead or dying. Lower left, on top of the steps, is a fluted
                        and broken pillar.</illusobjdesc>

                        Three vines extend horizontally between lines 2 and 3. The vine on the left
                        includes a loop and one ivy-like leaf. The next vine to the right, which
                        extends from the horizontal descender of the "y" in "vineyards" (line 2),
                        bears two oak or grape leaves. The largest vine, furthest to the right, has
                        long, slender leaves. At least four insects, perhaps beetles and one
                        caterpillar, crawl on it; there may be a fifth insect, perhaps a grasshopper,
                        on the vine at far right. Three winged insects (some little more than dots)
                        and one butterfly (below "fury" in line 2) fly above the vine, with three
                        more dots that might be winged insects flying below the vine just left of
                        the right margin. Below "of his" in line 2, a bird perches on the vine but
                        spreads its wings as if about to fly into the air. An oak or grape leaf
                        grows into the left margin from the first letter of the first word of line 3
                        ("The"). A vine with ivy-like leaves extends horizontally between lines 8
                        and 9, divides into several branches in the right margin, and has one branch
                        arching back to the left at line 6. A branch bearing five oak leaves and one
                        acorn extends into the right margin following the final line of text. To the
                        right of this branch, a bird flies upward on extended wings. From the first
                        letter of the first word of line 10 ("And"), a vine extends downward and
                        almost touches the flames below. A vine with two loops grows from the first
                        letter of "FINIS" (line 12) and extends horizontally above the
                        word.</illusobjdesc>
