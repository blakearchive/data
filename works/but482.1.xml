                electronic edition of thirty-three of Blake’s water color illustrations to the
                Bible. All take their subjects from the New Testament and have been added to the
                twenty Old Testament subjects published in March 2010 as “Illustrations to the
                Bible, c. 1780-1824,” under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings. This new
                group is presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the
                Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of
                Blake’s images). <lb/><lb/> Blake executed most of these New Testament water colors c. 1800-05 for his
                patron Thomas Butts. The exceptions are <hi rend="i">The Whore of Babylon</hi> of
                1809 and <hi rend="i">The Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins</hi> in the Yale
                Center for British Art, datable to c. 1825. The subjects range from the childhood of
                Jesus to his ascension, the later history of his parents and one of his major
                followers, St. Paul, and a group of eight designs based on the Book of Revelation.
                While the illustrations of the life of Christ are fairly conventional in their
                subjects, in part because of the long tradition of picturing almost every event in
                the Gospels, individual motifs recall designs in Blake’s illuminated books and thus
                offer a window on Blake’s visual interpretation of the Bible. The illustrations of
                Revelation complement Blake’s intense engagement with apocalyptic events and images
                in his own poetry. <lb/><lb/> The selection of fifty-three biblical water colors now available in the
                Archive will be supplemented in the future with early works, such as <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>, datable to c. 1780, and will continue through Blake’s
                final biblical water colors, such as <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the
                    Bulrushes</hi>. <lb/><lb/> As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access
                restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible by the
                University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with the University of Rochester, the
                continuing support of the Library of Congress, and the cooperation of the
                international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us

Toward the left of the
                        design stands Jesus in contrapposto, facing forward but slightly to the
                        left. He has long, curly hair and a beard, as well as a halo-like radiance
                        around his head and a possible aura around the upper part of his body. He
                        wears a gown. His arms are at his side, with his right arm bent slightly,
                        palm out with fingers slightly spread. His left leg is bent and on tiptoe.
                        To the left of Jesus stand two children in the foreground. The leftmost
                        child appears to be a young gowned girl with long, curly hair, standing in
                        contrapposto so that she faces forward and slightly left but looks up to the
                        right at Jesus. Her arms are at her side, though her right arm is slightly
                        bent and she holds the hand of the figure to the right with her left hand.
                        Her left leg is bent and perhaps on tiptoe. Her body posture mimics that of
                        Jesus. The rightmost of these two figures appears to be that of a young boy
                        with short, curly hair. He wears a shirt with buttons and a pair of
                        knee-length breeches. He also stands in contrapposto so that his body faces
                        forward and slightly left, but he looks up to the right—perhaps at Jesus.
                        His left arm is at his side, but his right arm is bent to hold the hand of
                        the figure to the left. His left leg is bent and extended back slightly, as
                        well as on tiptoe. In the background to the left of Jesus stand three gowned
                        figures, all facing forward but looking to the right, perhaps at Jesus. The
                        leftmost figure is that of a male with short, curly hair and a beard. The
                        middle figure appears to be that of an old male with short, curly hair and a
                        beard. His left arm is at his side and his mouth may be slightly open. The
                        rightmost figure of this group appears to be a young male (or possibly a
                        female) with long hair. His left arm appears to be at his side and his mouth
                        may be slightly open. In the foreground to the right of Jesus stand six
                        gowned children. The leftmost child appears to be that of a young girl with
                        long, slightly curly hair. She faces forward and looks up and to the left,
                        perhaps at Jesus. Her arms are bent upward with her palms together as though
                        in prayer or supplication. The second-to-left child of this group appears to
                        be a boy with long, curly hair. He faces forward and left, perhaps looking
                        at Jesus. His arms appear to be at his side. The third-to-left child of this
                        group appears to be a girl with long, curly hair. She faces left and looks
                        up, perhaps at Jesus. Her arms are bent upward with her palms together as
                        though in prayer or supplication. Her left leg is extended backward slightly
                        and on tiptoe. The third-to-right child appears to be a boy with short,
                        curly hair. His right arm appears to be at his side. He faces forward and to
                        the left and looks slightly down. He may be smiling slightly. The
                        second-to-right child appears to be a girl with long, wavy hair who faces
                        forward and to the left, perhaps looking at Jesus. Her arms appear to be at
                        her side and her mouth may be slightly open. The rightmost child appears to
                        be a girl, facing away and slightly left, but with her head turned slightly
                        right. She appears to have long hair pulled up into a bun. Her arms are at
                        her side but bent upward slightly. Her left leg is extended backward and on
                        tiptoe, suggesting that she may be walking. In the foreground to the right
                        of Jesus kneels an old woman, facing left and down. She bends forward or
                        hunches over slightly. She wears a gown and a veil covering her hair. Her
                        left arm is raised horizontally (relative to her body) and points downward,
                        perhaps reaching for the hem of Jesus's garment. Her right arm is bent
                        upward and holds her gown to her stomach. In the background to Jesus's right
                        stands a group of eight figures. The leftmost figure is that of a male with
                        short, curly hair, facing forward and to the left, perhaps looking at Jesus.
                        His right arm appears to be at his side, while his left arm is bent, with
                        the left hand held to his chest. All that is visible of the second-to-left
                        figure is the head of an old male with a long beard, but apparently bald
                        crown. He faces forward and to the left and looks down slightly. All that is
                        visible of the third-to-left figure is the head of an old male with a long
                        beard. He faces to the left and down. The fourth-to-left figure is that of a
                        female with long, slightly curly hair, perhaps pulled back into a bun. She
                        faces forward and slightly left and looks down, perhaps at the children in
                        the foreground. Her arms are at her side and bent; with her right arm she
                        holds the arm of the leftmost figure of the group, while in her left arm,
                        she holds an infant. The baby has long hair and is seated on its mother's
                        arm. Its gender is indeterminable, and it faces away and slightly left. Its
                        left arm is at its side and its left leg is bent. All that is visible of the
                        third-to-right figure of this group is long hair. The second-to-right figure
                        is that of a male with short, slightly curly hair and a beard. He faces to
                        the left and forward, perhaps looking at Jesus. The rightmost figure of the
                        group is that of a woman, facing left and perhaps looking at Jesus. She has
                        long hair pulled up into a bun and holds her bent left arm to her chest. The
                        ground below the figures has slight indications of
                        vegetation.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="AC"><characteristic>Christ</characteristic><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>aura</characteristic><characteristic>halo</characteristic><characteristic>radiance</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>contrapposto</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>arms at side</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent</characteristic><characteristic>palm out</characteristic><characteristic>palm facing viewer</characteristic><characteristic>fingers spread</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent at knee</characteristic><characteristic>tiptoe</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Toward the left of the design stands Jesus in contrapposto,
