            <updatestmt> 
The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of a digital edition of forty-seven monochrome wash drawings created by Blake between c. 1774 and c. 1786.  
<lb/>
<lb/>
The use of monochrome washes to tint a pencil or pen and ink drawing offered eighteenth-century artists several advantages. They could register gradations in tone, from the white of the untouched paper to jet black, without the more time-consuming use of actual colors. No further work was required if the wash drawing was intended as a preliminary for an uncolored engraving. A monochrome wash could also be used to underlie subsequent applications of water colors, thereby darkening selected areas to create the illusion of depth or cast motifs in shadow.  
<lb/>
<lb/>
As the works presented here show, Blake made full use of monochrome washes from his earliest years as an artist. When assigned by his engraving master, James Basire, to record tombs in Westminster Abbey c. 1774-75, Blake applied black and gray washes to tint many of his drawings (Objects 1-5). These carefully executed works could then be used as preliminaries for subsequent engravings by Basire’s workshop.
<lb/>
<lb/>
Blake’s monochrome washes during his first decade as an independent artist and engraver include several interrelated groups. The seven drawings of figures from Michelangelo’s Sistine ceiling (Objects 37-43) demonstrate how copying engravings of works by Renaissance masters helped Blake learn postures and gestures he would later use in his own compositions. Other drawings provide visual evidence of how Blake developed a design from early sketches to highly finished water colors or engravings. The recto/verso drawings, <hi rend="i">Two Sketches for “Joseph Making Himself Known to His Brethren”</hi> (Objects 34 and 35), are preliminaries for the finished water color in the Fitzwilliam Museum, one of three illustrations of the biblical story of Joseph that are among Blake’s finest pictorial works of the 1780s. The three Joseph water colors are in the Archive along with a water color preliminary for <hi rend="i">Joseph Ordering Simeon to be Bound</hi>. The evolution of one of Blake’s earliest original book illustrations, a frontispiece for Thomas Commins’ <hi rend="i">Elegy Set to Music</hi> of 1786, can be traced through three variant wash drawings (Objects 45-47) and a pencil sketch also in the Archive. The four wash versions of <hi rend="i">The Good Farmer</hi> reproduced here (Objects 16-19), in addition to two pen and ink drawings of the subject previously added to the Archive, show the complex ways Blake played variations on a theme as he worked toward a final version. No such finished work is known, and thus these drawings are our only record of Blake’s engagement with this subject. Similarly, for <hi rend="i">War Unchained by an Angel, Fire, Pestilence, and Famine Following</hi>, an untraced work Blake exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1784, we have only a preliminary study (Object 6).
<lb/>
<lb/>
Blake’s illustrations to his poem <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> of c. 1789 are among his most accomplished monochrome wash drawings. These have been published in the Archive as an independent group coordinated with the <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> manuscript.

                <objnote><p>This is one of seven monochrome wash drawings (Objects 37-43) by Blake of figures painted by 
                    Michelangelo in the Sistine Chapel. They were very probably copied from the engravings of Adamo Ghisi, 
                    after drawings by Giorgio Ghisi, published in *Pitture dipinte nella Volta della Capella Sistina nel 
                    Vaticano* (1773). The wash drawing, *Abiud*, is on the verso of this drawing.</p>
                    <p>Frederick Tatham added a pen and ink inscription in the lower right corner of the leaf bearing this drawing.</p>

                    <illusobjdesc>This wash drawing, after a fresco by Michelangelo, shows a gowned female figure sitting on a large block. The figure faces right in a contracted posture and appears to be winding yarn. Her right arm bends 90 degrees at the elbow and her right palm faces up to hold the ball of yarn in it. Her hand may rest on her right leg or is held parallel to it. Her left arm is raised horizontally to hold a piece of yarn with her thumb and middle finger. She spins or winds the yarn around the structure to her right, which already holds several turns of the yarn. Her right leg crosses her left leg at the knee, and her right foot dangles while the left foot rests with toes on the floor and heel against the block. Both feet are bare. She wears a long dress tied at the waist and with long sleeves. She sits on fabric that dangles over the right side of the block. It may be a part of the scarf or wrap around her head, or it may be a part of her gown. A yarn swift, used to wind yarn, is to the right of the figure. It consists of a long vertical pole that extends from the ground to the height of the seated figures’ shoulders, a horizontal perpendicular pole at the top, four poles extending downward from the horizontal pole at 45 degrees to form a four-sided isosceles triangle, and four poles extend upward at 45 degrees from each side of the base of the four-sided triangle to form two isosceles triangles at either side of the horizontal pole. The block on which the figure sits rests on a bare floor. The background is plain, perhaps representing a bare wall behind the figure.</illusobjdesc>
