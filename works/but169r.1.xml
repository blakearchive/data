                <objnote><p>This is one of seven monochrome wash drawings (Objects 37-43) by Blake of figures painted by 
                    Michelangelo in the Sistine Chapel. They were very probably copied from the engravings of Adamo Ghisi, 
                    after drawings by Giorgio Ghisi, published in *Pitture dipinte nella Volta della Capella Sistina nel 
                    Vaticano* (1773). The wash drawing, *Abiud*, is on the verso of this drawing.</p>
                    <p>Frederick Tatham added a pen and ink inscription in the lower right corner of the leaf bearing this drawing.</p>

                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>This wash drawing, after a fresco by Michelangelo, shows a gowned female figure sitting on a large block. The figure faces right in a contracted posture and appears to be winding yarn. Her right arm bends 90 degrees at the elbow and her right palm faces up to hold the ball of yarn in it. Her hand may rest on her right leg or is held parallel to it. Her left arm is raised horizontally to hold a piece of yarn with her thumb and middle finger. She spins or winds the yarn around the structure to her right, which already holds several turns of the yarn. Her right leg crosses her left leg at the knee, and her right foot dangles while the left foot rests with toes on the floor and heel against the block. Both feet are bare. She wears a long dress tied at the waist and with long sleeves. She sits on fabric that dangles over the right side of the block. It may be a part of the scarf or wrap around her head, or it may be a part of her gown. A yarn swift, used to wind yarn, is to the right of the figure. It consists of a long vertical pole that extends from the ground to the height of the seated figures’ shoulders, a horizontal perpendicular pole at the top, four poles extending downward from the horizontal pole at 45 degrees to form a four-sided isosceles triangle, and four poles extend upward at 45 degrees from each side of the base of the four-sided triangle to form two isosceles triangles at either side of the horizontal pole. The block on which the figure sits rests on a bare floor. The background is plain, perhaps representing a bare wall behind the figure.</illusobjdesc>
