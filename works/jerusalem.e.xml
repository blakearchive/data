                                    The William Blake Archive www.blakearchive.org is pleased to announce the publication of the electronic edition of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem The Emanation of The Giant Albion</hi> Copy E. <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> is Blake's masterpiece in illuminated printing, and this copy is his greatest achievement in the medium. Consisting of 100 relief and white-line etchings divided into four chapters, <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> is his longest illuminated book, and its plates are among his largest, approximately 22.5 x 16 cm. Though dated 1804 on its title plate, it was not printed in its entirety until c. 1820. Five complete copies are extant, along with one incomplete colored copy (chapter 1 only) and three complete posthumous copies.<lb/><lb/>             
                                    Copy E, the only complete colored copy, is magnificent. All but one plate (51, in black ink) were printed in red-orange on one side of large sheets of J. Whatman 1820 paper, elaborately finished in watercolors, pen and ink, and gold. Each impression is numbered in pen and ink in the top right corner; the first two pages have decorative borders and all the others have one thin line drawn in red-orange ink around the image, setting off each page like a miniature painting. Blake is reputed to have worked on this colored copy well into his final years, though he never found a buyer.<lb/><lb/>
                                    Copy E, from the Paul Mellon Collection of the Yale Center for British Art, joins other copies in the Archive printed and colored in this late style: <hi rend="i">America a Prophecy</hi> Copy O, <hi rend="i">Europe a Prophecy</hi> Copy K, <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> Copies G and I, <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> Copy P, <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> Copy O, <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen</hi> Copy G, and <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> Copies Z and AA. <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> Copy E will eventually be joined by Copy A, whose plates in part 1 are arranged differently, and by Copy I, a posthumous copy, presumably printed by Frederick Tatham, who inherited all of Blake's plates and art works, including <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> Copy E, after Blake's wife Catherine died.<lb/><lb/>
                                    As recipients of our Archive Updates are well aware, we have been working on <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> Copy E for several years. The challenges presented by its scope and difficulty made it an attractive laboratory, in effect, for experiments in editorial method. Many of the adjustments in protocols and processes that arose as solutions to the problems of creating an electronic edition of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> have already been introduced into other works we have published in the meantime. These include significant alterations in transcription, display, editorial notation, even in line numbering. We also took the opportunity to rescan all of our first generation 4 x 5 inch color transparencies at higher resolution on better equipment, producing digital images of exceptional fidelity and beauty that capture even the texture of the paper. This rescanning and color-correcting process took over two years.<lb/><lb/>
                                    The Archive now contains at least one copy of each of Blake's 19 illuminated books, and in most cases includes copies from each of the printings of the books, for a current total of 49 copies, all fully searchable. In addition to the books, the Archive includes the engraved <hi rend="i">Illustrations of the Book of Job</hi>, generally considered Blake's masterpiece in traditional line engraving and the culmination of his long pictorial engagement with the Book of Job. His first series of 19 watercolors illustrating Job (commissioned c. 1805-06 by his chief patron, Thomas Butts) are available in the Archive in Preview, our mode of presentation that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (our image annotation program). Also in Preview are Blake's illustrations to Milton's "L'Allegro" and "Il Penseroso." Also forthcoming this year are Blake's engraved designs for Robert Blair's <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, Edward Young's <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi>, and the Job pencil sketches, along with an illustrated Blake biography and glossary and never-before-reproduced copies of illuminated books.<lb/><lb/>
                                    As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible through the continuing support of the Library of Congress, the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia, by a major grant from the Preservation and Access Division of the National Endowment for the Humanities, by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and by the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.

fairies mentioned in the first paragraph of "To the Public" (Plate 3).  
Markings on the wings of the three figures at the top, bottom, and 
lower right represent astronomical objects.  Clockwise from the top are 
a gowned, moth-like female flying in a horizontal position; a gowned 
female flying in a standing position with her face hidden in her hands, 
as if mourning; a nude female lying face up with her eyes closed—
sleeping or dead—her long hair stretched out above her head, and her 
arms raised vertically; above her, sitting or squatting, a gowned 
female with her head resting on her hand, as if mourning; and a figure 
with less determinate features, though probably a gowned female, flying 
in a near-vertical position.  Perhaps all five of the figures around 
the title are fairies acting in parallel to the main action of the 
poem.  Or perhaps the figure on the bottom is actually Jerusalem ("Wingd with 
Six Wings" [Plate 86, line 2] according to Los) sleeping the Sleep of 
Ulro while flanked by two mourning women.  The colors of the 
background, especially along the bottom and right sides of the plate, 
may suggest a rainbow, sunset, or sunrise in a cloudy sky—or light 
breaking in on darkness—with an area of darkness above the figures and 
blue sky in the central areas.  An assortment of human and animal 
figures appears among the letters of the title, and a few of the 
letters have vegetative extensions.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="AB"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>shoe</characteristic><characteristic>wing</characteristic><characteristic>moth</characteristic><characteristic>body horizontal</characteristic><characteristic>flying</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>arm wrapped around head</characteristic><characteristic>star</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>angel</characteristic><characteristic>fairy</characteristic><characteristic>dragonfly</characteristic><characteristic>petal</characteristic><characteristic>hat</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent upward</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The text of the title is surrounded by five figures with

figure's face is obscured by a kind of hat whose points resemble flower 
petals, perhaps a sunflower's, topped with what may be ribbon or antennae (there is a similar hat on the figure 
directly opposite).  The lower part of her body tapers to a point, like 
the body of a butterfly.  Her wings, which seem to replace or extend 
her otherwise long hair (sweeping upward), have a shape that may be 
butterfly-like, though the thickness of their top edges suggests the 
wings of a bird or angel.  The bottom set of wings is marked by indistinct

crescent moon.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="CD"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>Jerusalem</characteristic><characteristic>wing</characteristic><characteristic>ribs</characteristic><characteristic>butterfly</characteristic><characteristic>lying</characteristic><characteristic>supine</characteristic><characteristic>arms raised vertically</characteristic><characteristic>legs together</characteristic><characteristic>feet</characteristic><characteristic>palm up</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>fairy</characteristic><characteristic>sun</characteristic><characteristic>star</characteristic><characteristic>moon</characteristic><characteristic>crescent</characteristic><characteristic>planet</characteristic><characteristic>sphere</characteristic><characteristic>globe</characteristic><characteristic>sleeping</characteristic><characteristic>Ulro</characteristic><characteristic>eyes closed</characteristic><characteristic>genitals</characteristic><characteristic>breasts</characteristic><characteristic>vegetating</characteristic><characteristic>bracelet</characteristic><characteristic>leaf</characteristic><characteristic>angel</characteristic><characteristic>chrysalis</characteristic><characteristic>body horizontal</characteristic><characteristic>fainting</characteristic><characteristic>fibers</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The text of the title is surrounded by five figures with

of the plate a nude female with her eyes closed lies supine, breasts

extended between her wings above her head.  Her right palm is up, and 
she wears a bracelet on her right wrist.  Her feet are vegetating, and 
her pubic area is crisscrossed in a way that suggests vegetative 
filaments.  Her wings are elaborately veined or ribbed, fringed with 
points, and divided into three sets.  The lower set is marked with 
stars, separated into zones by lines that may suggest the veins of a 
leaf.  The middle set is marked by two crescent moons in opposing 
phases.  The upper set is marked by two suns or planets.  She is 
probably Jerusalem ("Wingd with Six Wings" [Plate 86, line 2], 
according to Los) in the Sleep of Ulro—or perhaps a fairy in a

beside "The Giant Albion," a gowned female squats or sits on the extension of the “A” of “Albion,” just above

her, is mourning over the female below, her cheek rests on her left 
hand; she holds her right arm bent with the palm forward.  Though her 
wings resemble those of the other two figures in the lower half of the 
plate, the color and configuration of hers may be more bat-like than 
theirs, and hers lack astronomical markings.  Her long hair extends up 
and back into her wings, and her face is fringed with a pointed cap or 
hat—perhaps the points of sunflower petals or batwings on either side of her face—like the one that hides 
                                 the face of the figure opposite her. She is dressed in the most detailed clothing of any figure on the plate.

interlinear designs.  Midway down the plate on the left, a nude female
is one of three or four winged creatures flanking the verse portion of
the text (lines 22-33).  Her legs are together, terminating in roots or
other vegetable matter rather than feet.  Bat- or flame-like wings—or
spiky leaves suggesting a vegetative state—substitute for arms.
Across the way from her, to the right of the poem, are three more
ambiguous shapes, the topmost of which (to the right of and above
"heaven" in line 22) appears more bird-like than human.  The
lower figure, following "desire" in line 27, is a miniature version,
its features less defined, of the female on the left side of the plate,
and the middle motif is an amorphous shape whose status, whether animal
or vegetable, is difficult to determine.  Various other small-scale
vegetative motifs, for the most part extensions of letters, adorn the
text here and there, e.g., the serpentine flourish extending left of
the "T" of "The" in line 9 and the single-looped vine growing from the
"s" of "parts" near the bottom of the plate (line 46).  The text appears
to be inscribed on cloud.  In the upper corners of the plate the words
"SHEEP" (left) and "GOATS" (right) are integrated into the design, as

sky.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="C"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>wing</characteristic><characteristic>bat-winged</characteristic><characteristic>root</characteristic><characteristic>tail</characteristic><characteristic>flying</characteristic><characteristic>leaf</characteristic><characteristic>spiky</characteristic><characteristic>flame-like</characteristic><characteristic>vegetating</characteristic><characteristic>supine</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>legs together</characteristic><characteristic>fairy</characteristic><characteristic>floating</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Midway down the plate on the left, a nude female is one

mountain peaks.  Leaning against a tree at far right, around whose

the serpent with her left hand, she retrieves from beneath its head an 
indeterminate oval-shaped object with her right, the apparent

woman with Eve.  These associations are tentative: one might interpret 
her gesture as an act of giving rather than receiving, for instance.  In this vein, 
it is possible that the woman is giving the indeterminate oval-shaped object to the 
serpent; she may be feeding him, in a parallel to the above vignette 
which may be illustrating "the labour of the husbandman" (line 12).

mourners, all apparently female (though the gender of the one at far 
right is ambiguous), lamenting over the nude body of the sleeping 
Albion.  He lies supine on a flat, grassy surface with arms raised 
horizontally, eyes closed, and head—in the foreground—tilted back so 
that his lifeless expression is clearly visible to the viewer.  The 
mourner to Albion's left kneels prostrate beside him, her prominent 
right hand near his face.  The mourner at right buries her(?) head 
between her knees; her left foot is visible from beneath the folds of her 
garment.  Three more females grieve at far left: two stand 
weeping in identical postures, their hands covering their faces.  
Interposed between them and the prostrate woman, another female, the 
only mourner whose countenance is visible, tears her hair in vexation, 
her eyes raised upward.  Dark clouds and a sky rent by lightning 
appear in the background.  Two conspicuous stars, their 
disproportionally large size suggesting, perhaps, that they are falling 
to the earth, flank Albion's (also conspicuous) feet.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="D"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>dead</characteristic><characteristic>corpse</characteristic><characteristic>eyes closed</characteristic><characteristic>Albion</characteristic><characteristic>supine</characteristic><characteristic>lying</characteristic><characteristic>sleeping</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>arms raised horizontally</characteristic><characteristic>feet</characteristic><characteristic>head bent back</characteristic><characteristic>facing up</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>head toward viewer</characteristic><illusobjdesc>At the bottom of the plate, a dead, injured, or sleeping 
nude male lies supine on a flat grassy surface with arms outstretched 
along the ground in cruciform position, eyes closed, and head—in the 
foreground—tilted back so that his lifeless expression is clearly 
visible to the viewer.  He most likely represents the disease-ridden 
("I saw disease forming a Body of Death" [line 10] ), sleeping Albion, 
over whom weep, in Plate 4, "nurses," "mothers," "sisters," and 
"daughters" (line 16).  The figure's long hair spreads out, neatly 
parted, on either side of his head.  His prominent feet form part of 
the skyline, flanked by two conspicuously large stars.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="C"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>Daughters of Albion</characteristic><characteristic>nurse</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>crying</characteristic><characteristic>mourning</characteristic><characteristic>grief</characteristic><characteristic>young</characteristic><characteristic>hands on face</characteristic><characteristic>head down</characteristic><characteristic>shoulders hunched</characteristic><characteristic>bending forward</characteristic><characteristic>arms bent</characteristic><illusobjdesc>At far left of the design at the bottom of the plate, two

stands facing right, with head bowed and shoulders hunched, and covers 
her face with her hands.  The two mourners, who appear more youthful(?) 
than the hair-tearing figure right and front of them, may be the 
"sisters," "daughters," or "nurses" who weep over Albion in Plate 4

demeanor signify her grief: the only mourner whose countenance is 
visible, she casts her eyes upward  and tears her hair in vexation.

left foot, positioned, like the prostrate mourner's hand at left, near

plumed(?), broad-brimmed hat; in the middle, a vertical bearded(?) nude
male reaches down with large compasses as if to measure and draw the
lines that are inscribed on the surface of a globe.  Below the globe a
third figure, a gowned female with her hair pulled back(?), kneels(?)
on a solid surface.  Facing away from the viewer, she reaches upward
with her right arm to indicate a point on the globe.  The globe itself, 
presumably the earth, is inscribed with latitude and longitude
markings—and with the ends of several lines of the poem that mention
points of the compass, including, prominently, "east &amp; west" (line 48).
From the lowest point of the globe extends a spiral coil of some sort.
Below the kneeling female, in the bottom right corner, are slight
suggestions of plant life.  The outlines of clouds in the right margin

sky occasionally appears, a nude(?) male with short hair lies facing 
forward on his left side with his raised head resting melancholically 
on his left hand, while his right arm lies along his right side.  His 
eyes are either closed or blank, like a tomb effigy; his body, 
likewise, is pale, as if sculpted of stone, and both his head and feet 
rest against small mourning angels of the sort one might expect in tomb 
sculpture.  The left side of his body seems unrealistically flat, as if 
partly embedded in the ground beneath.  He lies at the verge of a body 
of water marked by foaming waves, especially near his elbow.  Centered 
directly above him is a long-haired, gowned female who flies or floats 
facing forward.  The small circles at her knees may be the "Bells of 
silver" at the knees of Jerusalem, as described by Los (Plate 86, line 
30), and the six-segment configuration that surrounds her may be the 
"Six Wings" he mentions earlier in the same description (line 2).  If 
she is Jerusalem, then the nude male is almost certainly the giant 
Albion.  A rainbow of six colored bands arches over them both.  Beneath 
the rainbow are clouds and the night sky with six stars and a lunar 
sphere with a crescent at its periphery.  Above the rainbow are more 
clouds and, along the right margin, two stars in the night sky.  Against the clouds that envelope the text, six cosmic objects that 
appear to be (clockwise from the top) the sun, a ringed planet that is 
probably Saturn, the earth and a crescent moon, and a light and a dark 
sphere that probably represent other planets.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="CD"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>partly nude</characteristic><characteristic>short hair</characteristic><characteristic>sleeping</characteristic><characteristic>dead</characteristic><characteristic>Albion</characteristic><characteristic>giant</characteristic><characteristic>statue</characteristic><characteristic>tomb</characteristic><characteristic>stone</characteristic><characteristic>petrifying</characteristic><characteristic>effigy</characteristic><characteristic>lying on side</characteristic><characteristic>melancholy</characteristic><characteristic>head up</characteristic><characteristic>eyes closed</characteristic><characteristic>eyes raised</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>arm braced</characteristic><characteristic>head on hand</characteristic><characteristic>arm at side</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>tights</characteristic><characteristic>loincloth</characteristic><characteristic>body horizontal</characteristic><characteristic>arm resting</characteristic><characteristic>legs together</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A male with short hair lies facing forward on his left

leg may be intended to suggest one of Blake's transparent garments.  
His eyes, though slightly raised, are either closed or blank, like a 
tomb effigy; his body, likewise, is pale, as if sculpted of stone, and 
both his head and feet rest against small mourning angels of the sort 
one might expect in tomb sculpture.  The left side of his body seems 
unrealistically flat, as if partly embedded in the ground beneath.  If 
the female figure above him is Jerusalem, then he is almost certainly 
the giant Albion.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="CD"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>walking</characteristic><characteristic>flying</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>arms at side</characteristic><characteristic>right foot</characteristic><characteristic>head up</characteristic><characteristic>wing</characteristic><characteristic>butterfly</characteristic><characteristic>palms down</characteristic><characteristic>circle</characteristic><characteristic>eyes raised</characteristic><characteristic>eye</characteristic><characteristic>bell</characteristic><characteristic>Jerusalem</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>fairy</characteristic><characteristic>hovering</characteristic><characteristic>floating</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Centered directly above the male figure at bottom flies

of the way across the plate in the main design at bottom.  He lies 
supine but turns clockwise toward the viewer, his head resting on his 
right shoulder, and he appears to be dead or sleeping.  Flanking him 
are two pairs of mourners: the pair at far left kneels just beyond 
Albion's head.  Standing at the other end of the body, beside the left 
foot, are two gowned daughters(?) who weep, grief-stricken, their hands 
covering their faces (cf. similar scenes of lamentation at the bottom 
of Plates 9 and 14).  Two more children lie crushed beneath the giant, 
the one further left apparently enrooting in the surrounding grassy 
terrain, the other prone and somewhat obscured by Albion's right thigh.  
A partially dismembered(?) figure (minus head and arms?) lies supine 
atop Albion's other thigh.  The landscape of the vignette comprises 
grass, hillocks, and leafy trees.  A blazing sun peeps above the 
horizon, its position, as well as the fiery palette of the sky, 
suggesting the time is sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="CD"><characteristic>Albion</characteristic><characteristic>giant</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>lying</characteristic><characteristic>lying on side</characteristic><characteristic>twisted</characteristic><characteristic>body horizontal</characteristic><characteristic>supine</characteristic><characteristic>dead</characteristic><characteristic>corpse</characteristic><characteristic>sleeping</characteristic><characteristic>eyes closed</characteristic><characteristic>genitals</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>head on shoulder</characteristic><characteristic>arm behind back</characteristic><characteristic>legs together</characteristic><characteristic>left foot</characteristic><characteristic>touching</characteristic><characteristic>stone</characteristic><characteristic>father</characteristic><characteristic>muscular</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Albion's "Outstretch'd . . .

atop his left thigh.  He is turned clockwise toward the viewer, lying 
partially on his right side, and appears to be dead or sleeping; his 
head rolls back against his right shoulder so that his strained neck is 
fully exposed, and his eyes appear to be closed (cf. the figure of Albion extended across the bottom of Plate 14).  Neither arm is 
visible, the right presumably obscured by the slightly elevated 
terrain, the left drawn back.  His legs look to be positioned together 
except for the small gap between them, which is colored to blend in with 
flesh and muscle and seemingly contoured to resemble rocky terrain 
(Albion's Rock?).  His left foot may be touching the gown of one of the 
mourners at far right.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="C"><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>dead</characteristic><characteristic>corpse</characteristic><characteristic>supine</characteristic><characteristic>headless</characteristic><characteristic>dismembered</characteristic><characteristic>facing up</characteristic><characteristic>legs bent</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent at knee</characteristic><characteristic>lying</characteristic><characteristic>body horizontal</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Surrounding the giant Albion's nude body are seven of his

Albion's "Outstretch'd . . . Giant beauty on the ground . . . His 
Children exil'd from his breast pass[ing] to and fro before him" (plate 
18, line 47 to Plate 19, line 2; cf. Plate 21, lines 8, 11: "First fled 
my Sons, &amp; then my Daughters . . . drivn forth by my disease").  The 
yellow glow of the sun in the main design extends upward, washing 
across the bottom third of the cloud on which the text is inscribed.  
Four figures lunge leftward across the top of the plate against a background of blue

plate at the end of the chapter, depicts a male figure, probably 
Albion, tortured by three nude females arranged in pyramidal fashion 
around him.  The females are probably (clockwise from left) Rahab, 
Vala, and Tirzah.  From her victim's abdominal area Tirzah draws out a length of 
entrails and winds them onto a skein she holds in her left hand.  This 
unweaving of the body relates Tirzah, as well as her two companions, to 
the Fates of classical mythology who spin but also cut the thread of 
life.  Next to her, top and center, Vala spreads her veil, canopy-like, 
over the other figures.  The veil's long blood-colored strands, which 
extend from her hands and hair, look to be of a piece with Albion's 
entrails.  Sitting on a stone at left, Rahab looks down at Albion whose 
head falls back on her lap.  He appears to stare back at her, 
transfixed, his mouth slightly ajar.  Various celestial motifs are 
seared on Albion's body: an anthropomorphic sun and moon decorate 
each thigh; three stars girdle his loins; another constellation of 
stars appears above his left knee; and two single stars decorate his 
right side, one on his shoulder, the other on his leg just below the 
distressed-looking sun.  Albion kneels on grassy terrain, his legs 
spread; the two females flanking him sit on stone steps.  Blue wash 
suggesting sky backs the top of the design, giving way to a lighter 
gray/blue cloud behind the text.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="AC"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>Rahab</characteristic><characteristic>Fates</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>torture</characteristic><characteristic>sitting</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>facing down</characteristic><characteristic>head down</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>legs crossed</characteristic><characteristic>legs together</characteristic><characteristic>arm behind back</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>head on hand</characteristic><characteristic>lap</characteristic><characteristic>bun</characteristic><characteristic>bending forward</characteristic><characteristic>hunched over</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A male figure, probably Albion, is tortured by three nude

three women to the Fates of classical mythology who spin but also cut 
the thread of life.  At left Rahab, her hair in a bun, sits on a stone 
step with left leg crossed over right.  Her right arm is behind her 
back, her left bent upward.  She rests her forehead on her left hand

relates the three women to the Fates of classical mythology who spin

above the others, her arms raised horizontally, palms and head down.  
Though mostly obscured, her legs appear to be crossed.  She spreads her 
veil—variously described in the text as composed of blood, net, and 
veins (Plate 67, line 17; Plate 90, lines 5-6)—over the other figures, its long fibres, which 
resemble Albion's entrails, streaming from her fingers and hair, which

presumably resting atop the stone structure.  Her arms are extended in 
front of her as she draws out a length of Albion's entrails from his 
abdominal area, winding them onto a skein she holds in her left hand.  This 
unweaving of the body relates Tirzah, as well as her two companions, to 
the Fates of classical mythology who spin but also cut the thread of

and Albion's entrails, the repetition of color visually reinforcing the 
motif of blood and viscera.  She looks down at Albion, tears staining 
her face, and her mouth appears to be slightly open.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="CD"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>Albion</characteristic><characteristic>torture</characteristic><characteristic>victim</characteristic><characteristic>partly nude</characteristic><characteristic>breeches</characteristic><characteristic>muscular</characteristic><characteristic>bending backward</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing up</characteristic><characteristic>head up</characteristic><characteristic>head bent back</characteristic><characteristic>kneeling</characteristic><characteristic>legs spread</characteristic><characteristic>arms drawn back</characteristic><characteristic>genitals</characteristic><characteristic>pain</characteristic><characteristic>fainting</characteristic><characteristic>limp</characteristic><characteristic>sinews</characteristic><characteristic>intestine</characteristic><characteristic>disembowelment</characteristic><characteristic>blood</characteristic><characteristic>mouth open</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>arm behind back</characteristic><characteristic>constellation</characteristic><characteristic>sun</characteristic><characteristic>star</characteristic><characteristic>moon</characteristic><characteristic>crescent</characteristic><characteristic>anthropomorphic</characteristic><characteristic>Orion's belt</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A semi-conscious male(?), probably Albion, is tortured by

exposing his genitals, which are partly concealed by his transparent, 
short breeches.  His arms are drawn back so that only his right upper

Albion's body: an anthropomorphic sun and moon decorate each thigh;

the plate is organized as a single design; the fiery backdrop 
integrates the upper and lower units of the design, its smoky flames 
licking the spaces at the ends of lines in the text area.  At the 
bottom of the plate, a nude female(?) emerges from the abdomen or 
ribcage of a supine, curly-haired male whose head is twisted nearly 180 
degrees counterclockwise, facing down.  His visible eye is open in a 
kind of death stare.  The flames enveloping the two figures seem to 
radiate symmetrically outward from the female, 
resembling a pair of ad hoc wings, and the light of the fire, brightest 
near their faces, forms a halo or aura around her, which seems 
to encompass the male (to a lesser extent) as well.  The woman appears 
to look up at the gowned, curly-haired figure at the top of the plate 
who, seen from behind, hovers among the flames with horizontally raised 
arms.  The design as a whole is usually thought to represent the 
creation of Eve from Adam, described on Plate 42: "the Saviour in mercy 
takes / Contractions Limit [Adam], and of the Limit he forms Woman" 
(lines 33-34).  The text, as well as the stigmata on the gowned 
figure's feet (clearly visible on the feet <hi rend="i">and</hi> hands 
in other copies, less so here), point to an alternative iconographical 
tradition in which Christ, not God, is the creator of Adam and Eve.  
The recumbent, sleeping, and/or death posture of the male and the 
flame-like wings of the female also suggest a possible identification 
of the figures with Albion and Jerusalem respectively.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="D"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>wing</characteristic><characteristic>flame-like</characteristic><characteristic>Eve</characteristic><characteristic>Jerusalem</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>facing up</characteristic><characteristic>head up</characteristic><characteristic>head bent back</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>mouth open</characteristic><characteristic>arms at side</characteristic><characteristic>upper body</characteristic><characteristic>halo</characteristic><characteristic>aura</characteristic><characteristic>light</characteristic><characteristic>dividing</characteristic><characteristic>heads, multiple</characteristic><illusobjdesc>At the bottom of the plate a nude female(?), visible only

forward, with head bent back and turned to the right as she looks 
up toward the gowned figure in flames at the top of the plate.  Her 
mouth may be slightly open.  The flames enveloping the two attached 
figures seem to emanate symmetrically from either side of the female in 
wing-like fashion, and the light of the fire is brightest around her 
face and head, giving a halo effect.  The design is usually thought to 
represent the creation of Eve from Adam (with reference to the creation 
text on Plate 42: "the Saviour in mercy takes / Contractions Limit 
[Adam], and of the Limit he forms Woman" [lines 33-34]), but her wings

even shifted a little underneath his torso and buttocks.  One or both

is slightly bent.  The folds and lines of his gown resemble the thick 
flames all around him.  The figure most likely represents Christ; the 
design as a whole generally is thought to illustrate the creation of 
Eve from Adam, with reference to the creation text on Plate 42: "the 
Saviour in mercy takes / Contractions Limit [Adam], and of the Limit he 
forms Woman" (lines 33-34).  The text, as well as the stigmata on the

the heads and torsos of the figures, casting a bright light about them, 
which dissipates toward the edges of the design, becoming dark and 
smoky, especially in the top left corner.  Flames form wing-like shapes 
on either side of the female.  The ground on which the male at the

the cloud-like panel of text and star-studded sky midway down the plate 
integrating the upper and lower design components.  At the top of the 
plate, a gowned, Christ-like figure with long hair and beard kneels on 
grassy terrain.  Beams of light radiate from him, creating an aura or 
halo effect.  He looks down at a second male figure, nude, whom he 
embraces and supports with his bent left leg and extended right arm.  
The limp posture and insensible demeanor of the nude figure suggest he 
is unconscious, injured, or dead.  The pair probably represent Christ 
and Albion, respectively, with reference to Albion's despairing words 
on Plate 24: "Look not so merciful upon me O thou Slain Lamb of God / I 
die!  I die in thy arms tho Hope is banishd from me" (lines 60-61; cf. 
Plate 48, lines 2-3).  The two are flanked by a palm tree (at left) and 
a large oak (at right), as described on Plate 23, where Albion 
collapses "between the Palm tree &amp; the Oak of weeping" (lines 25, 27).  
Albion's right foot touches a winged sphere that spans the width of the 
plate.  At the bottom of the plate, Jerusalem lies supine on what 
appears to be a bier floating on the sea.  Her 
shroud-like wings double as a covering for the bier.  Hovering above 
her is the menacing spectre of the text (lines 3, 5), flanked by a sun 
(at left) and a moon (at right).  The sun's fierce rays give way to 
nighttime clouds and a dark sky.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="A"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>cloak</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>head down</characteristic><characteristic>facing down</characteristic><characteristic>bending forward</characteristic><characteristic>hunched over</characteristic><characteristic>shoulders hunched</characteristic><characteristic>Christ</characteristic><characteristic>kneeling</characteristic><characteristic>legs bent</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>embracing</characteristic><characteristic>beams of light</characteristic><characteristic>halo</characteristic><characteristic>aura</characteristic><characteristic>light</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>hand raised, palm up</characteristic><characteristic>right foot</characteristic><characteristic>arm extended</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Kneeling on one knee at the top of the plate, a gowned

a winged sphere spanning the width of the plate.  The figure's head is 
bent back, fully exposing his neck; his visible eye appears to be 
closed.  The two figures probably represent Christ and Albion, with

menacing spectre of the lower design is flanked by a sun (at left) and 
a moon (at right), the lower crescent of which is emphasized.  The

") was added by engraving (i.e., intaglio engraving rather than relief etching) after the plate was etched (Erdman page 810n); according to Bentley, the first 6 words were additions "engraved (not etched) in intaglio," the last four words "incised in White line" (Bentley page 495n).  But the engraving or etching process is technically the same for white line and for intaglio; the difference is in the printing, whether from the surface of the plate or from the etched or engraved grooves.  The addition might be more precisely described as follows: The first five words are printed in relief, with the surrounding area partly gouged out with an engraving tool to create a striated or mottled background—almost a gray tone.  Most of the first letter of the sixth word ("the") continues with this technique, but the last two letters are defined primarily by thin white lines delineating the outlines of relief letters surrounded by a relief background. The last three words and the ampersand were engraved in white line within islands of relief surfaces that print black. If indeed all this work on both the letters and their contrasting backgrounds was executed
with a tool rather than with acid, then the line was added after the
initial etching of the plate.</note></l></lg><vspace extent="1"/><lg type="verse" justify="left"><l n="jerusalem.e.illbk.37.03" justify="left" indent="1">I feel my Spectre rising upon me! Albion! arouze

bat-winged.  Another pair of horses seen in profile (mere outlines, 
though a foreleg of one is clearly visible), as well as the upper ends

the scene as a whole perhaps a representation of the Four Zoas taking 
up their fourfold bows and arrows (see Plate 97, lines 8-12); in this 
network of associations, the arc-shaped cloud would substitute for the 
invisible fourth bow, twice described in the text as obscured by cloud: 
"clouds roll around the / Horns of the wide Bow" (Plate 95, lines 15-
16; cf. Plate 98, lines 5-6).  The bows seem to do double duty as both 
supports for the arrows and wings for the horses, thus literalizing the 
image on Plate 38 of "long winged arrows of thought" (line 16).  A 
cloud of text is superimposed over the sky motif of the plate.  Rather 
than functioning as interlinear ornamentation, the undulating marks 
between lines of text (i.e., those between lines 12 and 13, 16 and 17, 
and 24 and 25) give definition to (or suggest small breaks in) the

sinks beneath) a gently sloping horizon, its beams washing across the 
cloudy sky.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="AB"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>bald</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>old</characteristic><characteristic>sitting</characteristic><characteristic>riding</characteristic><characteristic>flying</characteristic><characteristic>bat-winged</characteristic><characteristic>dragon</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>arm extended</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised at 45 degrees</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised at 135 degrees</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent</characteristic><characteristic>arm drawn back</characteristic><characteristic>arm reaching downward</characteristic><characteristic>fist</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>hand beside head</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>facing down</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent at knee</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>shooting</characteristic><characteristic>right foot</characteristic><characteristic>touching</characteristic><characteristic>bow</characteristic><characteristic>arrow</characteristic><characteristic>Zoa</characteristic><characteristic>bending forward</characteristic><characteristic>straddling</characteristic><illusobjdesc>At the top of the plate, a bald, bearded (and probably

down at an approximately 45-degree angle to hold the bow grip.  He is 
mounted on an airborne horse, the twosome flying through a dark and

leaping or galloping position.  Another pair of horses seen in profile

from the features of the other.  Though not visible, the man's hands 
are presumably resting on the open pages.  Beneath him is a large 
scroll whose unfurled section at left contains mirror writing:

his Spectre's power<lb/>
Untill the arrival<lb/>

The octave suggests that the giant figure (Albion?) may need to be 
awakened.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="C"><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>scribe</characteristic><characteristic>sitting</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>facing up</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>head up</characteristic><characteristic>writing</characteristic><characteristic>reading</characteristic><characteristic>pen</characteristic><characteristic>quill</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>leg extended</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent at knee</characteristic><characteristic>touching</characteristic><characteristic>arm on lap</characteristic><characteristic>hand on knee</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent</characteristic><characteristic>palm down</characteristic><characteristic>hand resting</characteristic><characteristic>arm resting</characteristic><characteristic>arm at side</characteristic><characteristic>leaning</characteristic><characteristic>facing away</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Beneath the giant figure in the design at the bottom of

grapes that a nude female reaches up to harvest(?).  She is supported 
by a column of six other figures in various awkward and apparently

a seemingly defenseless nude male (left).  Alternatively, the female 
may be liberating herself from the web-like structure still binding the

in arms, lower body supine with legs raised.  The grassy bank or shore 
on which he vegetates gives way at right to a dark body of water over 
which the female hovers with arms raised horizontally.  Her long hair 
merges almost imperceptibly with the net fragments clinging to her 
hands, fingers, and feet.  The plethora of both textual and pictorial 
images of Reuben and Albion enrooted in or trapped by visceral and/or 
vegetative fibres makes it likely that the male at left represents one

mouth open, apparently about to swallow three smaller fish headed in 
its direction.  Descending the right margin, a water serpent swims 
facing down, its mouth also open, and below it are three more fish.  
Dark waters advance across the bottom margin from the left corner, 
transforming to clear blue at right; strands of seaweed grow in the

numerous larger and smaller birds, bats, and insects, alongside an

Beulah" in line 30; after lines 24-25; several after lines 46-52; and 
after lines 62-65.  The birds after lines 21-23, 48-50 (perhaps an 
eagle), and 62-65 are larger and more distinctive, with widespread 
wings and forked tails; they may be ascending in flight.  The bird—or 
butterfly or moth—after lines 62-65 has bat-like wings but does not 
otherwise appear to be a bat.  There are bats, however—or butterflies 
or moths—after line 27, and probably after line 53.  Flying insects 
are prominent after lines 33-38.  The two larger ones may be 
dragonflies, the two smaller ones flies, bees, or moths.  There are 
three other flying insects, the middle one of which (beneath "Human") 
may be a dragonfly, between lines 26 and 27.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="vegetation" location="E"><characteristic>vine</characteristic><characteristic>leaf</characteristic><characteristic>tree</characteristic><characteristic>branch</characteristic><characteristic>loop</characteristic><characteristic>fruit</characteristic><characteristic>mushroom</characteristic><illusobjdesc> Various tendrils and bits of vine-like or leaf-like

extension on the "C" of "Cloud" at the end of line 5 and a bit of 
vegetation under "Death" at the end of line 13.  Between stanzas 2 and 
3, there are elaborate extensions on "Beulah" (a branch), "Daughter" (a 
tree), and "Beulah" in line 22; compare the rudimentary extensions that 
mark almost the same sequence of words—in this case a plural 
"Daughters"—in line 40 below.  Between stanzas 3 and 4, there is a 
mixture of looped vines, letter extensions, and the like.  Similarly 
after line 31, there are extensions from lines above and below, 
including a leaf from the "s" of "afflictions" in line 32.  "Tears" in 
line 32 is curiously connected by a squiggle to "West" two lines below.  
"[G]old," "Eight," and "every" in lines 36-38 have odd extensions. The 
one-line stanza at line 54 is set off by numerous decorative extensions 
on letters in lines 54 and 55 and by an especially elaborate extension 
from the final letter of "tears" at the end of line 54 that fills the 
margin in that area and sends a vine-like branch back between lines 54 
and 55.  After line 57 this involved tangle of vegetation may include 
fruit, perhaps even a tiny mushroom.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="object" location="BD"><characteristic>cloud</characteristic><characteristic>intestine</characteristic><characteristic>serpentine</characteristic><characteristic>anthropomorphic</characteristic><characteristic>fire</characteristic><characteristic>scroll</characteristic><characteristic>drapery</characteristic><illusobjdesc>At the end of lines 15-19 is a scroll-like or serpentine

southeast coast of England.  Facing forward with his legs half-immersed 
in the water, Hand sits on a flat surface at the foot of the cliffs.  
From an opening in his upper chest emerges a serpentine stream of other 
nude males, presumably Bacon, Newton, and Locke, who hover against a 
background of flames that continue into the right margin of the text 
above.  The figure nearest Hand has two heads; from an opening in his 
chest emerges a second figure from whom—though in his rear-facing 
position his chest cannot be seen—a third figure emerges. In the skies 
above the horizon on either side of the island are contrasting scenes: 
on the left, streaks of rain, a bolt of lightning and a sphere that may 
be a full moon; on the right, a sunrise or sunset showing the sun 
partially visible at the horizon and two other spheres above it, 
perhaps other suns, though the top one may be a moon with its crescent

Janus; from an opening in his chest emerges a second figure.  The body

disappears into Hand's chest (at least one leg of every figure is not

planted on Hand's face, as if to push from that point.  A bit of his 
right arm is visible just above Hand's crown; his bent left arm is 
raised up over his left head and disappears behind the top of his right 
head. It is possible that this figure's two heads may in fact be the

These impressions may have been printed before the addition of the monogram, but more probably the monogram was present on the plate and was obscured by heavy inking that clogged its white lines or, in Copy E, obscured by subsequent hand coloring.  See reproductions in Paley, additional plates iv (National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne) and v (Fitzwilliam Museum), n.p.  Essick, cited in Paley (page 211), suggests that the Melbourne impression may have been originally intended for Object 51 of Copy E.  The Melbourne impression is printed in the same orange ink as the other plates of Copy E, while Object 51 in Copy E as we have it is the only impression printed in black. In the Keynes proof impression (Fitzwilliam Museum), the figures are labeled in white line (left to right, beneath) "Vala     Hyle     Skofeld" (Bentley page 525n, Erdman page 811n).  Erdman maintains that the labeled version of the plate was "issued as a separate print" (Erdman page 811n).

(from left to right) Vala, Hyle, and Skofeld.  At far left Vala, 
gowned, sits facing forward on a slab-like throne, her bent, crowned 
head resting on her left hand and a fleur-de-lis scepter held against 
her right side.  Next to her, a nude, long-haired Hyle squats with 
knees drawn up in a posture of despair, head hanging low between his 
legs, and hands resting on the ground between his feet.  Skofeld (far

appear to be holding the scepter, though her arm and hand presumably 
keep it in place.  She wears a spiky crown.  Vala's hunched-over

of a giant sunflower dais floating on a body of water.  Her wings, 
divided into three sets, do double duty as a throne, each of the sets 
resembling the lateral extensions of a wing chair.  The middle and 
anterior wings, the latter of which seem to serve simultaneously as a 
bustle to the gown, are relatively nondescript, in contrast to the 
large-scale hind wings elaborately inlaid with celestial 
motifs, including stars, a waning crescent moon (left) and a globe or 
planet (right).  The figure's upswept hair is built to great heights, with 
fleurs-de-lis ornaments worked into it, but the rest of the triple-tiered crown of which they are a part is not discernible in Copy E.  Her elbows are propped on her knees, chin 
resting in the palms of her upraised hands, and she appears to be 
sleeping.  The figure may be associated with Vala or Rahab, but 
iconically she strongly resembles 
Jerusalem as depicted on the title page and as described in Los's 
Watch Song on Plate 86: "Wingd with Six Wings" (line 2) that spread 
like a "canopy" (line 10).  The identification is made more plausible 
by reading the chapter title, "Jerusalem" (inscribed on the body of

also includes a stole[?]) sits on top of a giant sunflower, facing 
forward.  Her wings, divided into three sets, do double duty as a 
throne, each of the sets resembling the lateral extensions of a wing 
chair; their general configuration suggests a heart.  The middle and 
anterior wings, the latter of which seem to serve simultaneously as a 
bustle to the gown, are relatively nondescript, in contrast to the 
large-scale hind wings elaborately inlaid with celestial 
motifs, including stars (right and left), a waning crescent moon (left) 
and a globe, planet, sun, or full moon (right); their bands of color suggest a rainbow.  
The figure's upswept hair is built to great heights, shaped like a spire 
extending to the top border of the design; fleurs-de-lis 
ornaments are worked into her hair, part of a triple-tiered crown only partially discernible in Copy E.  Her elbows are propped on her knees, chin 
resting in the palms of her upraised hands, and she appears to be 
sleeping; her mouth is slightly open.  The figure's attributes 
inevitably suggest an angel or a fairy, but also a butterfly, given her 
position nestled in the florets of the sunflower.  Though often 
associated with Vala or Rahab, iconically she strongly resembles Jerusalem as depicted on the title page and as 
described in Los's Watch Song on Plate 86: "Wingd with Six Wings" (line 
2) that spread like a "canopy" (line 10).  The identification is made 
more plausible by reading the chapter title, "Jerusalem" (inscribed on 
the body of water at lower left) as a caption to the design.  Beams of 
light radiate from the figure's wings-cum-throne.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="text" location="A"><characteristic>text</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The words "Jerusalem / Chap 3" are inscribed on the water

four other labels in two opposing pairs, "Reason" (top) and "Desire" 
(bottom), "Pity" (left) and "Wrath" (right).  The sphere thus 
apparently represents the globe of earth (compare the globe on plate

and lower parts of the design seem, at least to some degree, constituents of a single 
conception, as signaled, for instance, by the continuity of the sky in 
the right margin.  At top left, a gowned figure of indeterminate gender 
whose long hair hides its face sits sleeping(?) beside what is probably 
a cloud-table that is continuous with the background of the text, which 
is washed and shaped, notably along the right margin, to suggest a 
cloud formation.  The cloud supports a scroll that terminates in a 
spiral at far left.  The figure's upper body leans sharply left across 
the surface of the scroll; in the foreground, the left forearm rests on 
the surface of the scroll, as if the figure had fallen asleep while 
writing, though no writing instrument is visible.  Though the position 
of the right arm is uncertain, it too appears to be extended along the 
surface of the scroll.  Around the figure's head and upper body is a 
bright area with sharp beams of light defined against a secondary light 
rectangular area that contrasts with the darkness in the upper left 
corner, which is continuous with the darkness in the background of the 
upper design (and continues down the right margin).  The figure's feet 
are hidden by a strongly defined but unidentifiable, elongated intestinal or wave-like shape at the top edge of the text block.  Right of 
the sleeping figure is the remainder of the scroll, supported at its 
upper edges by two nude hovering figures, probably females.  The 
scroll, which has indecipherable marks on it, seems to continue across 
the sleeping figure's lap into a long serpentine curve that extends 
almost to the right edge of the design and then back left until it 
terminates in a second spiral at the sleeping figure's knee.  Beneath 
the text at the bottom, a gowned old man with long hair and beard lies 
prone on the ground with his head to the right; he twists his body 
clockwise to face up.  The toes of his right foot are visible.  He lies 
on or beside an open book; the index finger of his right hand marks his 
place in the book.  The position of his left arm and hand is harder to 
gauge, but his arm seems to be bent so that he braces his body partly 
with it; the lines that define his hand seem to blend with the lines of 
his hair and beard.  He looks up toward the sleeping figure at upper 
left.  The sky, washed to suggest sunrise or sunset in the area around 
his upper body and head, is dark further left.  The profile of this old 
man may suggest a hill or mountain, an association reinforced by the 
colors of his garment, hair, and beard.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="CD"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>old</characteristic><characteristic>lying</characteristic><characteristic>lying on side</characteristic><characteristic>right foot</characteristic><characteristic>prone</characteristic><characteristic>twisted</characteristic><characteristic>facing up</characteristic><characteristic>fingers</characteristic><characteristic>pointing</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>reading</characteristic><characteristic>palm down</characteristic><characteristic>arms bent</characteristic><characteristic>arm braced</characteristic><characteristic>mountain</characteristic><characteristic>hill</characteristic><characteristic>reclining</characteristic><characteristic>head up</characteristic><illusobjdesc>At the bottom, a gowned old man with long hair and beard

tableau of the narrative of torture and sacrifice taking place in 
Albion's bosom (Plate 65 ff.).  Two nude women perform a ritual 
dance(?) around an insensate nude male with a shackle on his right 
wrist (he is perhaps fettered to the large rocks behind him).  The hair 
of each woman is twisted into a serpentine spike.  Their arms are 
raised horizontally: in their right hands they wield knives just above 
the victim's head; in her left hand, the female at left brandishes a 
bloody face(?), and dangling from the left forearms of both figures are 
what may be more body parts, possibly scalps.  Although largely 
obscured from view, another scalp(?) seems to ornament the breast of 
the left female.  Her companion balances a cup on the open palm of her 
left hand.  The shifting agents and recipients of torture in the text 
make it impossible to assign stable identities to the figures; rather, 
they most likely represent composite characters who are able to unite 
and divide at will: the Daughters of Albion, Vala, and Tirzah are all 
depicted with knives in the text of plates immediately preceding this 
one (e.g., Plate 63, line 40; Plate 66, line 21; Plate 67, line 25), 
and the cup is an iconic attribute repeatedly associated with both Vala 
and Rahab, who become the spliced figure of Vala-Rahab on Plate 70 
(line 32).  Similarly, the object of the confused violence in Plate 65 
ff. is sometimes Luvah, sometimes (or simultaneously) Albion, and 
sometimes a more generic victim.  In the background at right are 
megalithic monuments of sundry size and shape.  Other landscape details 
include grassy terrain and, perhaps, a bit of tableland in the 
foreground at far left.  The time is evidently night, as suggested by 
the deep blue sky and celestial motifs: a crescent moon and four stars 
of varying sizes.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="C"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>serpentine</characteristic><characteristic>spiky</characteristic><characteristic>dancing</characteristic><characteristic>running</characteristic><characteristic>lunging</characteristic><characteristic>legs spread</characteristic><characteristic>legs bent</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent forward</characteristic><characteristic>sacrifice</characteristic><characteristic>torture</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>facing down</characteristic><characteristic>head down</characteristic><characteristic>facing away</characteristic><characteristic>seen from behind</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>twisted</characteristic><characteristic>arms raised horizontally</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>knife</characteristic><characteristic>hands raised, palms down</characteristic><characteristic>palms down</characteristic><characteristic>blood</characteristic><characteristic>jewelry</characteristic><characteristic>bracelet</characteristic><characteristic>necklace</characteristic><characteristic>Daughters of Albion</characteristic><characteristic>Vala</characteristic><characteristic>Tirzah</characteristic><characteristic>Rahab</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The design at the bottom of the plate seems to offer a

insensate nude male shackled to large rocks.  She lunges left, but her

raised horizontally: in the right hand she brandishes a knife just 
above the victim's head; in her left hand, a bloody, flayed face or head;

She faces forward—legs spread in a deep lunge position, genitals 
exposed, and right knee possibly touching the male's—but her head is 
turned to the right.  The black object dangling between her legs, somewhat difficult to discern in the present copy, may suggest a phallus, making her a hermaphrodite. The figure's hair is twisted into a lethal-looking,

arms are horizontally extended in cruciform posture across a cluster of 
boulders, to which his wrists are shackled (though only the shackle on 
the right wrist is discernible).  He sits facing forward with legs 
drawn up; his right knee may touch that of his torturer on the right.  
His head falls limply back, nearly resting against his left shoulder; 
his eyes are closed; and his mouth appears to be slightly open, the 
overall demeanor suggesting unconsciousness, injury, and/or pain.  The 
shifting agents and recipients of torture in the text make it 
impossible to assign stable identities to the figures; the object of 
the confused violence in Plate 65 ff. is principally Luvah, sometimes

Bentley indicates merely that the catchword "His" "was erased from Copy A" (Bentley page 571n).  But the history seems complicated and reveals a possible change in the ordering of plates.  Paley explains:  "This copy bears the catchword 'His.'  This was expunged from Copy A, presumably because 71 begins 'And.'  In C the catchword was altered to 'And,' further disguising the fact that 70 could not have been intended originally to precede 71.  Wicksteed [<hi rend="i">William Blake's Jerusalem</hi>] 216 hypothesizes that, since in the present foliation no subsequent plate begins 'And,' the present 70 must have been meant to come much earlier in the sequence.  Plates beginning 'his' are 6, 17, 19, 38[34], and 31[45].  According to the measurements in B [<hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>] 736, 70 could have been etched on the verso of 8, but even if that is the case it does not tell us the original place of the present 70 in the sequence" (Paley page 247n).</note></l></textfoot></phystext></desc><desc id="jerusalem.e.illbk.71" dbi="jerusalem.E.P71"><objtitle>,

appears to be embracing a serpent's head with his right arm, of which 
only the upper part is visible; below his arm is the backside of a 
third figure whose head, if human, is presumably buried within the 
coils.  All the serpents save one have open mouths, the long, forked 
tongues of the outermost heads darting out, and five(?) have prominent

long, forked tongues of the outermost serpents (which bare their teeth) 
darting out, and five(?) of the heads have visible horns, as well (some 
horns more prominent than others).  The serpent in the bottom right

an indistinct nude female in the lower right margin raises her head and

nude figures, a female who hovers in a sitting position with both arms 
raised to hold a worm whose central portion is a male(?) human torso 
facing away from the viewer.  Its upper and lower extensions are 
vermiform; the lower extension coils around the waist of the female 
figure below and passes between her legs.  Plate 82 reports that 
sisters Cambel and Gwendolen, daughters of Vala, begin to transform 
their lovers, Hand and Hyle respectively, from worms into male human 
forms.  The design here on Plate 80 seems to depict some aspects of 
that process—either one transformation in progressive stages from 
bottom to top or both transformations, one at bottom, the other at top. 
The episodes on Plate 82 take place in "the Furnaces of Los &amp; in the 
Wine-press" (line 65), which may explain the juxtaposition of 
grapevines and leaves in the right margin with flames(?) along the 
bottom edge of the design.  (See, however, the descriptions of plate

indeterminate vegetation and the background an indefinite void, perhaps

her right arm at her side while raising her left arm vertically and

she seems to bend it back to look upward.  Plate 82 reports that

voluminous cloud, which recedes in a seemingly infinite number of 
regressive layers, suggesting a vortex.  The cloud is also a portal, 
whose periphery is inscribed with mirror writing (an ad hoc rectangular 
panel appended to it contains the verse's concluding couplet).  
Gathered near its entrance are twelve nude females.  The scene shows 
Gwendolen (left) conspiring with Cambel (right) to "entice" (Plate 82, line 19) the other 
ten Daughters of Albion.  Seen from behind, her hair wound in a bun, 
Gwendolen stands with legs crossed at the base of the billowing 
doorway, pointing toward it (or its text) with her right hand.  Her 
left hand, tucked behind her back and resting on her buttocks, signals 
her deception: "Forgetting that Falshood is prophetic, she hid her hand 
behind her, / Upon her back behind her loins" (Plate 82, lines 21-22).  
Listening to her sister, Cambel stands facing forward in contrapposto, 
her left hand covering her genitals; the right, her breasts.  The 
remaining Daughters hover at right in two distinct groups, the upper 
group of four in chorus-line formation, leaning inward, the bottom 
group of six stacked in a way that suggests nesting dolls.  The 
daughters at bottom appear inchoate: with one exception, their heads 
look disembodied, and a formless whitish-gold substance interconnects 
them—perhaps Rahab's cloud, which unites them on Plate 82 (line 12), 
but possibly Vala and/or Jerusalem's cloud (cf. Plate 80, lines 34-35

the toes of her left foot make contact with the ground.  She points 
toward the cloud (or its text) with her right hand (her index finger 
touches it).  Her left hand, tucked behind her back and resting on her 
buttocks, signals her deception: "Forgetting that Falshood is 
prophetic, she hid her hand behind her, / Upon her back behind her 
loins" (Plate 82, lines 21-22).</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="BD"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>Cambel</characteristic><characteristic>Daughters of Albion</characteristic><characteristic>listening</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>contrapposto</characteristic><characteristic>left foot</characteristic><characteristic>legs together</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent</characteristic><characteristic>arm reaching downward</characteristic><characteristic>breasts</characteristic><characteristic>hand on breasts</characteristic><characteristic>genitals</characteristic><characteristic>hand on genitals</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The scene shows Gwendolen (left) conspiring with Cambel

apparently, nude.  The frontmost daughter raises her hands, palms out, 
listening credulously to Gwendolen; her right leg is slightly bent, and 
her mouth may be slightly open.  Notwithstanding the differences in 
facial expressions, the other three appear to mirror their sister's 
gestures, though the viewer sees progressively less of each receding 
figure—the hindmost daughter is nothing more than a head rising above 
the others in the background.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="D"><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>Daughters of Albion</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>listening</characteristic><characteristic>hovering</characteristic><characteristic>twisted</characteristic><characteristic>head</characteristic><characteristic>upper body</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised vertically</characteristic><characteristic>palms vertical</characteristic><characteristic>touching</characteristic><characteristic>lying on side</characteristic><characteristic>arm at side</characteristic><characteristic>cloud</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The scene shows Gwendolen (left) conspiring with Cambel

stacked in a way that roughly suggests nesting dolls.  All face forward 
but look left toward Gwendolen and Cambel, and all appear inchoate: 
with the exception of the foremost daughter, who is presented nearly in 
full, their heads, adorned with long and/or curly hair, seem 
disembodied, and a formless whitish-gold substance binds them together-
-perhaps Rahab's cloud, which unites them on Plate 82 (line 12), but 
possibly Vala and/or Jerusalem's cloud (cf. Plate 80, lines 34-35 and 
Plate 81, line 15).  The central figure hovers on her left side, her 
upper body twisted clockwise.  Her left arm, like that of the hindmost 
daughter in the group (whose palm seemingly touches the hip of the sister 
standing above her), is raised vertically.  The right shoulder and 
upper arm of the bottom female are visible.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="object" location="AC"><characteristic>cloud</characteristic><characteristic>door</characteristic><characteristic>intestine</characteristic><characteristic>serpentine</characteristic><characteristic>worm</characteristic><characteristic>text</characteristic><characteristic>inscription</characteristic><characteristic>smoke</characteristic><characteristic>dark</characteristic><characteristic>darkness</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The voluminous cloud at left recedes in a seemingly

Keynes prints the lines in a note but denies that they are "really
part of the text" (Keynes page 920n).  Bentley (page 598n), Erdman (page 812n), and Paley (page 267n) all treat them as simply the last two lines of text on the plate,
though Bentley mentions that they could be an "afterthought" and breaks the
page so that those two lines, though numbered continuously with the rest, do
appear by themselves beneath the design.  In Paley's edition the page also
breaks at that point, though perhaps not with the intention of separating
the last two lines from the text above.</note></l><l n="jerusalem.e.illbk.81.22" justify="left">And he who will not bend to Love must be subdud by

given an exclamation point or not, this word seems to hang in mid-air"—and
goes on to note the differences in "lettering, technique, content" that
separate this plate from its successor (Erdman page 812n).  He supposes that Plate 84
"obviously did not originally follow" Plate 83.  Paley adds:  "Although the
lamentation of the Daughters continues from the end of 83, the last line of
the latter does not lead into 84: 1" (Paley page 273n).  A more satisfactory
hypothesis is that "Awake" is a catchword, as its placement suggests, and
that Plate 83 was originally designed to precede what is now Plate 97.  In
that arrangement, Jerusalem's decline at the end of Plate 83 is immediately
followed by a call for her to awake at the top of Plate 97.</note></l></textfoot></phystext></desc><desc id="jerusalem.e.illbk.84" dbi="jerusalem.E.P84"><objtitle>,

88, lines 23-34).  Los is seated at left with his left leg drawn back 
under his thigh, buttock resting on his left foot.  His right leg is 
bent at the knee with right foot planted squarely on the ground.  His 
upper body is twisted clockwise to face left, and his left arm is bent 
upward in a defensive gesture.  Three long, vine-like strands, which send 
forth leaves and bunches of grapes, are being pulled from his body, one 
each from the areas of his left underarm, his lower abdomen, and his 
groin.  These three strands are held aloft together in Enitharmon's 
left hand.  She kneels with both knees facing left, but she is twisted 
at the waist presenting her full back and is seen in right profile.  
Her long, serpentine lock of hair streams to the left.  Both figures 
are nude.  Enitharmon plies the three sections of entrails, which morph 
into well-leafed vines of another variety in her right hand (though the 
two sections are not continuous) after passing under two ambiguous 
objects (stones? fruit? stones or fruit doubling as testicles?) that 
she holds in her open right palm.  Two more vines similar in kind 
extend from her waist area.  Despite their close physical proximity to 
each other (their knees touch), the figures appear temporally 
distanced: the sky behind Los is hung with nighttime celestial motifs 
(crescent moon, comet, star, plus a vermicular cloud at far left), 
while that behind Enitharmon is colored in a rosy palette with blazing 
sun in the upper corner, suggesting the time is sunrise, or an odd 
fusion of sunrise and full daylight.  The grassy turf on which the 
figures kneel is seemingly edged with moss and lichens or other 
vegetation that extends up the left edge of the design.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="C"><characteristic>Los</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>short hair</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>torture</characteristic><characteristic>disembowelment</characteristic><characteristic>victim</characteristic><characteristic>sinews</characteristic><characteristic>intestine</characteristic><characteristic>sitting</characteristic><characteristic>kneeling</characteristic><characteristic>legs bent</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>hand on ground</characteristic><characteristic>root</characteristic><characteristic>mouth open</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>head down</characteristic><characteristic>facing down</characteristic><characteristic>twisted</characteristic><characteristic>pain</characteristic><characteristic>palm out</characteristic><characteristic>palm down</characteristic><characteristic>hand raised, palm out</characteristic><characteristic>vegetating</characteristic><characteristic>fibres</characteristic><characteristic>touching</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The design at the bottom of the plate shows Enitharmon

(perhaps) root-like.  Three long, vine-like strands, which send forth 
leaves and bunches of grapes, are being pulled from his body, one each

Three leaves that appear to be transforming into stars grow from the 
upper vines, and a ripe bunch of grapes hangs from the juncture where 
two strands merge.  The groin structure has a grape leaf, a bunch of 
grapes, and a loopy tendril.  Enitharmon plies the three sections of 
fibres, which morph into well-leafed vines of another variety in her 
right hand (though the two sections at right and left are not

shaped interstice (partially obscured by Enion's upper body) in the 
middle of the design is filled with flames or flame-like fibres and 
roots, and colored red to suggest fire.  The smaller crevices at

at Jerusalem's knee, is an old man with a long beard that stretches 
along the ground in front of her. She may be looking down toward him as 
she raises her arms upward from her bent elbows and holds her palms up.  
In the grassy background a hilly horizon is marked by three trilithons 
and one unidentifiable structure(?), perhaps a hill.  In the sky right of the seated 
female, the word "Jerusalem" appears above two of the trilithons, 
perhaps naming simultaneously the city represented by the trilithons 
and the woman in the foreground.  The sky is washed to suggest dawn 
breaking among dark clouds in a kind of halo above Jerusalem's head.  
In the lower right margin, below the bearded head, there are two worms.

backward.  Her bare left foot is visible.  Facing forward, her arms 
bent upward and hands raised with the palms up, she twists her body 
counterclockwise and bends her neck sharply right, perhaps to look down toward 
the bearded head at her left knee.  A bright area of sky creates the 
effect of a halo about her head; in that respect she seems to represent

groups or nations named in line 2 of this plate or the four sons of 
Jerusalem named on Plate 71, lines 51-53.)  The two heads furthest to 
the right are turned somewhat forward: of those two, the one in the

city (though the two may not be mutually exclusive in Blakean terms).

of the plate kneel in a queue on their left knees and bend forward, 
their right feet planted squarely on the ground (only the outlines of 
the rear figures are discernible, but the threesome clearly mirror one 
another in posture).  They face right, differing only in the 
orientation of their heads.  Their arms are extended in front of them, 
the right raised higher than the left to point directly ahead at some 
indeterminate object in the wings or on another plate; the left index 
fingers point down, perhaps in a denunciatory gesture.  They are 
identified by the inscription on their bodies, clearer in monochrome 
copies, whose tripartite subject is distributed across their backs 
(from back to front), and whose predicate and closing comparative 
clause are written on the front and middle figures' buttocks and 
thighs: "Anytus / Melitus / &amp; Lycon / thought Socrates / a very 
Pernicious / Man / So Caiphus / thought Jesus".  Anytus, Melitus, and 
Lycon are the three men whose accusations resulted in Socrates's 
execution, and Caiaphus is the high priest who played a role in Jesus's 
death, but the iconography and language simultaneously relate the three 
figures to the brothers Leigh, John, and Robert Hunt: their journal, <hi rend="i">The Examiner</hi>, used as its insignia a pointing hand, and 
an 1809 issue maligned Blake and his exhibition in a review that 
claimed the artist's putative mental instability had reached "a 
pernicious height."  Together the three pointing figures may represent 
the character Hand.  At the bottom of the plate a nude, long-haired 
female engulfed in fire reclines on her left side.  In front of her is 
an indeterminate structure, perhaps a low wall.  Alternatively, it 
could represent the side of a small boat, a possibility consistent with 
the wave-like appearance of the flames that lap across the bottom

figures (two of the three are only partially visible) may represent 
an event that follows the one depicted at the top of the previous 
plate: the three accusers shown in action there, Anytus, Melitus, and 
Lycon, have now fallen.  Together they may represent the character Hand 
(see the description of Plate 93).  The foremost figure, with short, 
curly hair, is lying on his left side, his upper body raised, its 
weight resting on his braced left arm.  His body is twisted to face 
forward; his head is bent sharply back.  His legs are together, with 
the top (right) leg bent slightly forward of the lower leg, and the 
foot of the right is crossed in front of the left, which extends upward 
in a shallow arc.  Only the upward-facing head and part of the right shoulder of the second, middle figure is visible at the far right.  
The rear figure seems to be lying on his side, turned away from the 
viewer, but with his head, again, facing up and bent back.  Upward and 
left from the feet, legs, and torsos of the figures extend several 
thick lines very much like those on (for example) the figure at the 
bottom of Plate 74: fibres of vegetative generation, intestines 
perhaps, or (more generally) streams of gore.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="vegetation" location="AB"><characteristic>grass</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The three figures seem to have fallen to the ground,

lower design may be "Albion cold" (line 2), supine beneath "England a 
Female Shadow" who "lays upon his bosom heavy" (lines 8-9)—or, a few 
lines later, "England who is Brittannia" who "awoke from Death on 
Albions bosom" (line 21).  In the design, at least, she shows no sign 
of waking.  She wears a long gown, and her long hair streams forward 
along her left arm, which reaches out as if embracing him.  Albion is 
depicted as a gowned old man, with long hair and the suggestion of a 
beard, lying flat on his back.  Between his body and the grassy ground 
is some kind of cloth, perhaps part of his own garment.  The lighting 
of the lower design suggests a sunrise over a dark, slightly hilly 
landscape.  A jagged rock juts out of the ground at upper left.  
(Compare the less identifiable mass in Plate 92—on the horizon between 
the seated female and the two trilithons on the right.)  The rock may 
represent London Stone (line 25), though so may the solid rectangular 
object at far right.  The stone structures on the horizon suggest that 
the location is the same as that of Plate 92—Jerusalem.  To the right 
of the rising sun is one trilithon and what appears to be a solid 
rectangular stone, perhaps an altar.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="CD"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>England</characteristic><characteristic>Brittannia</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>prone</characteristic><characteristic>lying</characteristic><characteristic>facing down</characteristic><characteristic>right foot</characteristic><characteristic>legs together</characteristic><characteristic>legs crossed</characteristic><characteristic>arms extended</characteristic><characteristic>embracing</characteristic><characteristic>reaching</characteristic><characteristic>mourning</characteristic><characteristic>sleeping</characteristic><characteristic>corpse</characteristic><characteristic>dead</characteristic><characteristic>lying on side</characteristic><characteristic>twisted</characteristic><characteristic>body horizontal</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The text on the plate suggests that the supine figure in

who is Brittannia entered / Albions bosom rejoicing" (lines 4-5), and 
the design here seems to depict an early stage of that entrance, shown 
at a later stage on Plate 99.  The couple, shown previously lying on 
the ground on Plate 94, are here altered.  In a burst of light and/or 
flames against a background of cloud or smoke, they hover cheek to 
cheek in an upright position with their eyes open.  They may be 
intended to be looking into each other's eyes, Albion reaching down 
from above and Brittannia reaching and looking up from below, though 
the actual impression is somewhat different.  Albion faces right and 
leans over Brittannia, while the position of his right leg suggests 
that his lower body is twisted counterclockwise away from her.  He 
looks down diagonally past her.  Brittannia's lower torso is turned

the viewer, a short-haired nude male(?) hovers, holding the globe of 
the sun on his left shoulder.  He may be Los's spectre.  On the right a

Enitharmon, Los's emanation.  Her body, considerably darker than the 
bodies of the two males, is turned away from the viewer as she faces 
left, looking either at her work in her left hand or at one or both 
figures to her left.  Raising her arms at 135 degrees, she holds a 
distaff or a spindle in her left hand.  From it to her right hand hangs 
a thick thread, colored in a way that suggests the "fibres" of 
generation.  The single thread multiplies into several similarly 
colored lines that extend down to a crescent moon at the level of her 
waist.  At the moon the threads multiply again as they extend from the 
moon down to the earth below.  Behind the figures, a serpentine line of 
trilithons winds, like a long wall, across a grassy landscape dominated 
by a single hill in the center.  The line of trilithons, which may 
represent one of the "Serpent Temples" mentioned on Plate 80, line 49,
