    The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of thirty-three of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible.  All take their subjects from the New Testament and have been added to the twenty Old Testament subjects published in March 2010 as “Illustrations to the Bible, c. 1780-1824,” under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.  This new group is presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).
                <lb/><lb/>
                   Blake executed most of these New Testament water colors c. 1800-05 for his patron Thomas Butts.  The exceptions are <hi rend="i">The Whore of Babylon</hi> of 1809 and <hi rend="i">The Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins</hi> in the Yale Center for British Art, datable to c. 1825. The subjects range from the childhood of Jesus to his ascension, the later history of his parents and one of his major followers, St. Paul, and a group of eight designs based on the Book of Revelation.  While the illustrations of the life of Christ are fairly conventional in their subjects, in part because of the long tradition of picturing almost every event in the Gospels, individual motifs recall designs in Blake’s illuminated books and thus offer a window on Blake’s visual interpretation of the Bible. The illustrations of Revelation complement Blake’s intense engagement with apocalyptic events and images in his own poetry.
                    <lb/><lb/>
                        The selection of fifty-three biblical water colors now available in the Archive will be supplemented in the future with early works, such as <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>, datable to c. 1780, and will continue through Blake’s final biblical water colors, such as <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi>. 
                    <lb/><lb/>

In the left foreground of the design stands Jesus, bending forward at the waist to point to and perhaps touch the floor with his right index finger. He faces right, in profile, and down, with his right arm raised horizontally relative to his body. He wears a gown and has long, curly hair and a beard. There is a halo-like aura around his head and his right leg is bent slightly at the knee. His right foot is visible and the toes of his left foot are visible beneath the hem of his gown. On the right of the design stands a woman, facing left, in profile, and looking down. She has long, curly hair and wears a gown like a toga that has slipped to expose her left breast. Her arms are tied together with a piece of rope behind her back. In the left background stand seven figures, all presumably male, facing away—perhaps exiting through an open doorway. Five of the figures are wearing gowns. Only the head, neck, and part of the left shoulder area of the leftmost figure of this group is visible. He has short, curly hair. The second figure from the left has short, curly hair and holds his arms at his side, bent. Only the head of the figure third from the left is visible. He has long hair. The middle figure of this group has long, slightly curly hair and has his right, sandaled foot on tiptoe. Only the head and part of the right shoulder area of the figure third from the right in this group is visible. He has slightly curly hair. The figure second from the right has curly hair and appears to have a hood on his gown. Both his sandaled feet are visible, the right leg extended backward and on tiptoe. Only the head of the rightmost figure is visible. He may have long hair. The scene takes place in a room with stone(?) walls, floor, pillar, and archways. The sky is visible through the left, open archway and appears to be cloudy.
