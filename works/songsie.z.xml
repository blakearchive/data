            The editors of the William Blake Archive are pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi>, Copy Z. It joins editions of three copies of <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> and two copies of <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi>. In the next week, these works will be joined by <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>, Copy D, <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen</hi>, Copy G, <hi rend="i">America, a Prophecy</hi>, Copy E, and <hi rend="i">Europe, a Prophecy</hi>, Copy B. All of these editions have newly edited texts and were scanned from 4x5 color transparencies made specifically for the Archive. They are all fully searchable for both text and images and are supported by the unique Inote and ImageSizer applications described in our previous updates.<lb/><lb/><hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> Copy G and <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> Copy Z were produced in Blake's late printing and coloring styles, c.1818 and c. 1826 respectively. <hi rend="i">America</hi> Copy E is a monochrome copy from 1793; <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> Copy B was color printed in 1794, and <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> Copy D was produced in 1795 on large paper and with some rudimentary color printing.<lb/><lb/>
            We will be adding second and third copies of most illuminated books in the coming months, with the goal of having the entire illuminated canon online later this year. In addition, work continues on the SGML edition of David V. Erdman's <hi rend="i">Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</hi>, which we anticipate releasing sometime this spring.

text of the title and subtitle begins in the area of sky that is visible at upper left; the title descends 
line by line into their midst, ending just over Adam and Eve's arched bodies.  An ascending bird 
spreads its wings in the area to the right of the first "Of" (line 3).  The initial "S," the "N," and the final

down the left margin.  Tendrils extending from both margins help separate the stanzas from one
another.  But the vine full of leaves and flowers(?) that extends across the top of the plate above the title
and fills the top right corner and the space right of the first stanza is distinct from the flame-like

her arms crossed and looks right; the one in the middle, who seems to have long hair, looks
forward; 
the one to the right looks left(?).  The upper bodies of the figures in both groups are lit from 
behind, perhaps to suggest haloes and thus the angels mentioned in the text (Object 20, line 14;

to look at her companion, who faces forward but looks left—in the direction her companion
points.  
To their left, close to the tree trunk, stand three other females.  The left-most figure has her arms 
crossed and looks right; the one in the middle, who seems to have long hair, looks forward; the
one to the right looks left(?).  The upper bodies of the figures in both groups are lit from behind, 
perhaps to suggest haloes and thus the angels mentioned in the text (Object 20, line 14; Object 21, line 7).</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="AC"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised vertically</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised at 45 degrees</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>flying</characteristic><characteristic>hovering</characteristic><characteristic>halo</characteristic><characteristic>angel</characteristic><illusobjdesc>In the vine-encircled tree trunk in the left margin are four(?) other gowned female

margins, and between the three stanzas.  The title area is full of vegetative swirls, curls, and loops, 
much of it associated with the extravagant extensions of three letters, the initial capitals "N" and 
"S" and the terminal "g" (line 2).  Several are colored to suggest long, slender leaves (the descender on
the 
"g," for instance), and there are three other prominent leafy formations in this area: one at the top 
of the "S," another growing from the "N" of "Nurse's," and the third in the top left corner.  Some 
of the loopy, vine-like decoration dangles in the left margin, and a large leafy structure occupies
the 
space at the end of short line 6.  Below it is a leafy weeping willow tree that leans right; its 
branches arch down into the sky/water.  Between stanzas (after lines 6, 10, and 14) and, in the right 
margin, at the ends of short lines are other vine-like structures.  The initial letters of stanzas 2, 3, 
and 4 have extensions that add to the decoration in the left margin.  Several human figures

Several 
varieties of vegetation fill spaces around the text and between stanzas.  The stanzas are separated 
by irregular vine-like structures that are sometimes extensions of letters (such as the "P" of "Pitying" in 
line 15) or extensions of other vegetation (as between stanzas 4 and 5) or, sometimes, discrete
bits. 
The initial "A" in the title (line 2) sprouts a plant-like structure on the left, while a loopy vine-like 
extension dangles down the left margin, broken between stanzas 2 and 3.  The decoration in the 
lower left margin is completed by a distinctive vine-like tendril that arises from the strip of grass 
across the bottom of the plate and extends into the space between stanzas 4 and 5.  The
vegetation 
in the upper right margin—beside the "m" of "Dream" in the title—seems to be an arc of tasseled 
grass or grain that curves back over the title.  Beneath it—opposite stanzas 1 and 2—are three or 
four clusters of flame-like leaves or tufts of grass.  Below those are a bit of leafy vine (after line 11) 
and a branch or root of some sort (after line 14).  In the lower right margin—opposite stanzas 4 
and 5—is an odd tree(?) rooted in the strip of ground that extends across the plate.  In front of the 
tree stands an indistinct figure, robed, wearing a hat, and holding a staff—probably the "watchman 
of the night" (line 18), the glow-worm of the text in human form.  He is one of four small and 
indistinct human figures on the plate.  The other three are in the area of the title: lying, presumably 
sleeping, on the left stroke of the initial "A"; sitting, probably reading, in the "D" of "Dream"; and 
floating or flying between bits of vegetation beneath the "e" of "Dream."  The animal life of the
poem 
appears in similarly tiny and indistinct (or questionable) forms in the margins: there could be an
ant 
(the "Emmet" of line 5) on the vegetation beneath "her" in 
line 10; a worm or caterpillar (poorly printed in this copy) nestled in the lower right sprigs of the 
vegetation right of line 7, and another more certainly in the grass just right of line 15; and winged 
beetles(?) (lines 20-21) flying right of line 5 and line 19.  A bird, perhaps an eagle, unmentioned 
in the text, spreads its wings above "dream" in line 3.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="D"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>watchman</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>robe</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>arm at side</characteristic><illusobjdesc>In front of the tree in the bottom right corner stands an indistinct figure, robed,

The two mourners are seen in profile facing left, their heads looking down toward the bodies, and 
holding their hands to their heads in gestures of distress, perhaps crying or in prayer.  The corpses are
arranged 
with their heads resting on pillows at left.  The visible (right) arm of the male is at his side. 
Except 
for their flesh-colored faces, the two might be taken for tomb effigies.  In the background is a 
paneled wall or partition flanked by pilasters—a cemetery wall, tomb, or church interior; on the 
right pilaster appears the ostensible date of publication, "1794" (line 5).  Above this structure, in a space 
colored to suggest sky and perhaps sunrise or (more plausibly) sunset, is the title, with its first and 
third words in heavy block letters.  In a lighted rectangle amidst deep shadows below the feet of
the 
mourning female is more publication information.  The rectangle is colored in a way that may 
suggest grass or an open grave.  Taken together, the rectangle and the vegetation—perhaps trees—

hair reclines, the weight of her upper body apparently supported by her arms (only her right arm is visible, and the left arm 
on which her head rests in other copies is an indistinguishable patch of blue here—perhaps a stone).  She may be the pretty rose tree of the poem.  At her feet, facing right in 
front of a tuft of grass, is a second long-haired figure, wearing a gown or possibly tights, sitting (or perhaps kneeling) in a contracted position.  The long hair and gown suggest a female, though the 
conventional reading of the poem constructs a male speaker who "tend[s]" the rose-tree "by day 
and by night" (line 8).  She(?) holds her visible hand around her head or on her right shoulder.  In the sky between the two 
figures are one large and nine small flying birds.  The area of sky behind the reclining female's

right.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="D"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>young</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>short hair</characteristic><characteristic>bun</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>arm behind back</characteristic><characteristic>arm at side</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent</characteristic><characteristic>arm wrapped around body</characteristic><characteristic>listening</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>facing away</characteristic><characteristic>seen from behind</characteristic><characteristic>kneeling</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>fingers spread</characteristic><illusobjdesc>At right stand three young gowned females with hair short or pulled back.  They 
look toward and listen to the bard.  The left-most of the three holds her arm at her side and partly behind her 
back; the 
right-most faces left and bends her arm up to hold the arm of the middle figure.  The central figure has left 
arm bent at the elbow and extended across her body.  At their feet and facing away from the viewer kneels a 
fourth young female similarly dressed and coiffured.  She looks toward the threesome rather than 
at the bard.  Her left arm is bent upward, with her left hand raised and fingers spread apart.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="vegetation" location="B"><characteristic>palm</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Over the head of the figure at far right arches a palm-like frond.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="vegetation" location="CD"><characteristic>grass</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Green tinting indicates grass on the ground below the figures.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="object" location="E"><characteristic>sky</characteristic><characteristic>shadow</characteristic><characteristic>sunrise</characteristic><characteristic>sunset</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The setting is rudimentary: a dark shadowy area behind the embracing couple to
