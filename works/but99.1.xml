            <updatestmt>
                The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of seventeen pen and ink drawings by Blake. Ranging chronologically from his apprenticeship as an engraver to the final decade of his life, this group offers a comprehensive overview of his work in the medium. Most were created when Blake was learning his craft as an artist and reveal his exploration of various themes and genres. His apprentice drawings for James Basire (<hi rend="i">The Body of Edward I and Countess Aveline</hi>) show his early engagement with medieval art. Another group (two drawings titled <hi rend="i">Figures from a Greek Vase</hi> and <hi rend="i">Charon</hi>) is clearly based on classical art or mythology, responses to which were central to British art and design in the second half of the eighteenth century. The cluster of related sketches on two leaves, each titled <hi rend="i">Four Composition Sketches</hi>, is the earliest extant example of Blake’s attempt to construct a pictorial narrative through a series of images. In these, he began to develop his own version of the sublime, an aesthetic more fully represented by the texts and designs in the illuminated books of the 1790s. Several works from the 1780s show the influence of neoclassicism and take their subjects from two fields of lasting interest to Blake: British history (<hi rend="i">King Alfred</hi>, <hi rend="i">A Woman Enthroned</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Procession of Monks</hi>) and the Bible (<hi rend="i">Saul and David</hi>, <hi rend="i">Goliath Cursing David</hi>, and two versions of <hi rend="i">The Good Farmer</hi>). The three much later drawings are exceptions to Blake’s customary procedures and subjects: a landscape <hi rend="i">Garden Path</hi>, <hi rend="i">The Prophet Isaiah</hi> drawn on a woodblock for a wood engraving never executed, and <hi rend="i">Lady Torrens</hi>, a copy of a family portrait by his friend and patron John Linnell.<lb/>
                <lb/>
                Blake did not execute a large number of pen and ink drawings. This is a bit surprising, given the compatibility between the linearity of the medium and his insistence on “the distinct, sharp, and wirey ... bounding line” as the “great and golden rule of art” (Blake’s <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi>). He did, however, make extensive use of pen and ink work to outline forms in his water colors, color prints, and hand tinted relief etchings in the illuminated books. For preliminary sketching, Blake favored pencil over pen and ink, probably because of the lower cost of pencil and the ease of erasure and correction it offered. The Archive will publish his pencil sketches decade by decade, beginning with the earliest works, 1779 through 1790.<lb/>
                <lb/>
                This is the first time that works from the Society of Antiquaries, London have been represented in the Archive. Accordingly, we are also publishing the Society's Blake collection list, which includes all of its original works by Blake, not just those published in the Archive, and joins the Collection Lists of over thirty other contributing institutions.<lb/>

                As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees.

                    <illusobjdesc>Facing forward, a seated central figure is flanked on either side by a pair of standing figures. The central figure, who is likely female, is gowned; she raises her right arm in a gesture and holds a circular object, perhaps a shield, with her left.  Her position, gesture, and accessories suggest she may be a queen, possibly Britannia or Boadicea.  Facing right, the pair of figures at left both appear to be male (perhaps with beards?) and may also wear gowns. The leftmost figure extends his bent right arm slightly.  The two figures at right appear to be gowned, though their genders are indeterminate.  The rightmost figure faces left and extends its left arm while its companion faces forward, with at least one arm bent at the elbow.  The scene may be set outdoors, as downward-curving lines behind the central figure suggest the canopy of a tree.  The small, enclosed shapes on the center right and left margins may be plants; the verticals behind the backs of both pairs of standing figures hint at more tree trunks.  Perhaps the two horizontal lines upper right, immediately above the figures’ heads and with diagonals extending down and to the right, may be the horizon (lower line) and a cloud band (upper line) with beams of light from a rising or setting sun.  The horizontal line top right may be a cloud.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>Facing forward, a seated central figure is flanked on either side by a pair of standing figures.  The central figure, who is likely female, wears a long gown.  Her hair may be short or arranged in an elaborate coiffure; alternatively, she may wear a hat, crown, or have laurels in her hair.  Her right arm is bent at the elbow and raised in some type of gesture.  Her left arm is by her side where she holds a circular or ovoid object that resembles a shield.  Her seated position suggests a queen on a throne.  However, the figure may also represent Britannia, often shown with a shield, or Boadicea, the first-century warrior queen of the Iceni in East Anglia.  Blake included “Boadicea inspiring the Britons against the Romans” in a list of English history subjects he wrote in his Notebook before 1793 (Erdman page 672).</illusobjdesc>

The leftmost male's right arm is bent at the elbow and extended slightly.</illusobjdesc>

The rightmost figure faces left in a contrapposto stance with his(?) left leg bent at the knee. His left arm is extended; his right arm may also be raised (possibly visible in front of his companion's chest).  Though his facial features are not articulated, the figure may look at his companion at left.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>Facing forward, a seated central figure is flanked on either side by a pair of standing figures.  The scene may be set outdoors, as downward-curving lines behind the central figure suggest the canopy of a tree.  The small, enclosed shapes on the center right and left margins may be plants; the verticals behind the backs of both pairs of standing figures hint at more tree trunks.</illusobjdesc>
