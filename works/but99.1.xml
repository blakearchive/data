                    <illusobjdesc>Facing forward, a seated central figure is flanked on either side by a pair of standing figures. The central figure, who is likely female, is gowned; she raises her right arm in a gesture and holds a circular object, perhaps a shield, with her left.  Her position, gesture, and accessories suggest she may be a queen, possibly Britannia or Boadicea.  Facing right, the pair of figures at left both appear to be male (perhaps with beards?) and may also wear gowns. The leftmost figure extends his bent right arm slightly.  The two figures at right appear to be gowned, though their genders are indeterminate.  The rightmost figure faces left and extends its left arm while its companion faces forward, with at least one arm bent at the elbow.  The scene may be set outdoors, as downward-curving lines behind the central figure suggest the canopy of a tree.  The small, enclosed shapes on the center right and left margins may be plants; the verticals behind the backs of both pairs of standing figures hint at more tree trunks.  Perhaps the two horizontal lines upper right, immediately above the figures’ heads and with diagonals extending down and to the right, may be the horizon (lower line) and a cloud band (upper line) with beams of light from a rising or setting sun.  The horizontal line top right may be a cloud.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>Facing forward, a seated central figure is flanked on either side by a pair of standing figures.  The central figure, who is likely female, wears a long gown.  Her hair may be short or arranged in an elaborate coiffure; alternatively, she may wear a hat, crown, or have laurels in her hair.  Her right arm is bent at the elbow and raised in some type of gesture.  Her left arm is by her side where she holds a circular or ovoid object that resembles a shield.  Her seated position suggests a queen on a throne.  However, the figure may also represent Britannia, often shown with a shield, or Boadicea, the first-century warrior queen of the Iceni in East Anglia.  Blake included “Boadicea inspiring the Britons against the Romans” in a list of English history subjects he wrote in his Notebook before 1793 (Erdman page 672).</illusobjdesc>

The scene may be set outdoors, as downward-curving lines behind the central figure suggest the canopy of a tree.  The small, enclosed shapes on the center right and left margins may be plants; the verticals behind the backs of both pairs of standing figures hint at more tree trunks.</illusobjdesc>

                        <characteristic>Facing forward, a seated central figure is flanked on either side by a pair of standing figures.  The two horizontal lines upper right, immediately above the figures’ heads and with diagonals extending down and to the right, may be the horizon (lower line) and a cloud band (upper line) with beams of light from a rising or setting sun.  The horizontal line top right may be a cloud.</characteristic>
