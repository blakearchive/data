            The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of 20 of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible. These designs illustrate the Old Testament and are arranged according to the passages illustrated.  They are presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).
            <lb/><lb/>
            The Bible had an enormous influence on Blake’s work as both artist and poet.  Among his many and complex responses to that text are water color drawings.  The present group of 20 is selected from a sequence of about 80 biblical water colors of similar size Blake painted for Thomas Butts between c. 1800 and 1805.  These designs emphasize interactions between the human and the divine.  In works such as <hi rend="i">Ezekiel’s Wheels</hi> and <hi rend="i">David Delivered Out of Many Waters</hi>, the interaction is revelatory or redemptive.  In other designs, including <hi rend="i">Pestilence: The Death of the First-Born</hi>, the relationship between God and humankind devolves into punishment and destruction.
            <lb/><lb/>
            This group of 20 water colors is the first installment in our publication of a large selection of Blake’s water color drawings illustrating the Bible.  In coming months we will publish a group of New Testament illustrations also from the series executed for Butts.  Later we will add early works, such as <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>, datable to c. 1780, and continue through Blake’s final biblical water colors, including <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi> of c. 1824.
            <lb/><lb/>

The blasphemer is a nude, muscular male who kneels in the center of the design. He bends backward, with his head back and turned to the right. His arms are at his side, though held behind his back as though his wrists are bound. His genitals are exposed. At least five stones are visible at the blasphemer's feet. Six more stones are held by the crowd. On the left are at least four gowned men, three participating in the stoning and facing right with their heads down looking at the blasphemer. The leftmost figure participating in the stoning is an old man with a beard, who looks at the blasphemer with his mouth slightly open. He may be speaking. His right leg is bent and he bends slightly forward. His left arm is bent and held to his chest; his right arm is raised at 135 degrees. He holds a stone in each hand. Behind the old man, and to the left of the design there is another figure. Only the back of the head and part of the gown of this figure are visible. Only the head and raised right arm of the third figure from the left are pictured. He also holds a stone. The fourth figure from the left in this group has short, curly hair and bends forward to look at the blasphemer. He raises his right arm at 135 degrees and holds a stone in his right hand. 
  Four gowned men may stand on the right side of the design, facing left and down. The figure at the front of this group is old with a beard, and may be partially bald. He bends forward to look at the blasphemer. His right arm is raised at 135 degrees and he holds a stone in his right hand. His left arm is drawn across his chest. His left leg is bent. Behind this figure is a man, with arm raised at 135 degrees and stone in his right hand. Only the right arm, hand and back of his head are visible. This figure may have curly hair. Behind him is a bald man with a long beard. He bends forward to look at the blasphemer. His right arm is raised at 135 degrees and in that hand he holds a stone. Only the short, curly hair and gown of the rightmost figure in this group is visible. Above the blasphemer rises billowing black smoke. The sky, though dark, appears to be clear. The scene takes place on a patch of bare earth.
