Jesus stands on the left side of the design, facing right. He is gowned, with his right foot visible under the hem of his gown. He has long hair, a beard, and a halo fromed of beams of light. His right arm is at his side, and his left is raised horizontally, palm down. He appears to be looking at Bartimaeus. To the left of Jesus stand two figures, perhaps apostles. The leftmost figure is a gowned male with a long beard. He appears to be old. He faces right and his right arm is bent upward, fingers spread. The figure to the right stands, facing forward but looking to the right. He has curly hair and a beard and also wears a gown. To the right of Jesus stands Bartimaeus, with his knees bent and his left leg extended backward and on tiptoe. His posture gives the impression that he is about to kneel or is rising from a kneeling position. He faces left and wears a loincloth. His right arm is raised horizontally, palm out, while his left arm is raised at 45 degrees and holds a piece of cloth or is just "casting away his garment" (Mark 10:50). He has short, curly hair and his eyes are closed to indicate his blindness. His mouth is open, perhaps crying out (Mark 10:48). To the right of Bartimaeus stands an old male figure, gowned and with long hair and a beard. He faces forward but looks to the left, perhaps at Jesus. His arms are raised and his hands are together in prayer. The figures stand on a dirt road or path. Between Bartimaeus's legs is a large rock. The background is marked with grass and leafy trees. On the right side of the design are mountain peaks. The sky is cloudy.
