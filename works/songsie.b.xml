			<updatestmt>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of electronic editions of Copies A and B of 
				<hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi>
				, both in the British Museum. Copy B is here reproduced in color for the first time, and, like all the illuminated books in the Archive, the texts and images of both copies are fully searchable and are supported by our Inote and ImageSizer applications.
				<lb/>
				<lb/>
				<hi rend="i">Songs</hi>
				Copy B is one of the first copies of the combined 
				<hi rend="i">Songs</hi>
				. Along with Copies C, previously published in the Archive (see the update for 9 March 1999), D, and E (forthcoming), it was formed in 1794 of 
				<hi rend="i">Innocence</hi>
				plates printed in raw sienna on both sides of the leaf in 1789 and 
				<hi rend="i">Experience</hi>
				plates lightly color printed in yellow ochre in the same format in 1794. By this time, Blake had decided to move Plates 34-36 (&quot;The Little Girl Lost&quot; and &quot;The Little Girl Found&quot;) from 
				<hi rend="i">Innocence</hi>
				to 
				<hi rend="i">Experience</hi>
				, but since Plate 34 was printed on the verso of the leaf with Plate 26 (&quot;A Dream&quot;), Plate 26, another 
				<hi rend="i">Innocence</hi>
				poem, is placed in this copy, as well as in Copies C and D, in the 
				<hi rend="i">Experience</hi>
				section. And, like Copies C and D, Copy B is missing Plate 52 (&quot;To Tirzah&quot;) but has the small vignette known as plate a (five cherubs and an adult male), one of Blake's earliest relief etchings used here as a tailpiece.
				<lb/>
				<lb/>
				Blake printed Copy A in 1795 on large sheets of I. TAYLOR paper along with Copy R, previously published in the Archive (see the update for 14 December 1999). This was the first time that Blake printed the 
				<hi rend="i">Innocence</hi>
				and 
				<hi rend="i">Experience</hi>
				plates in the same session and printed Plates 34-36 as 
				<hi rend="i">Experience</hi>
				plates. Nevertheless, he apparently meant for the two sections to form separate works. He did not print the combined title plate, printed 
				<hi rend="i">Innocence</hi>
				in grayish black ink and 
				<hi rend="i">Experience</hi>
				in an olivish light black ink, and stabbed and numbered the two parts as separate volumes. Copy A was produced as part of a set of illuminated books printed on large paper, approximately 38 x 27 cm, and joins other works from the large-paper set now in the Archive (
				<hi rend="i">All Religions are One</hi>
				Copy A, 
				<hi rend="i">There is No Natural Religion</hi>
				Copy L, 
				<hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi>
				Copy F, 
				<hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>
				Copy D, 
				<hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi>
				Copy G, 
				<hi rend="i">America, a Prophecy</hi>
				Copy A, 
				<hi rend="i">Europe, a Prophecy</hi>
				Copy H, 
				<hi rend="i">Songs</hi>
				Copy R, 
				<hi rend="i">The First Book of Urizen</hi>
				Copy B).

					<illusobjdesc>Two nude figures—the only vestiges of clothing are leafy vines around their loins—bend severely to the left, their bodies curved away from a powerful burst of flames and smoke(?) that extends all the way across the plate from the right 
margin.  They seem to represent Adam and Eve being driven from the paradise in Eden.  Eve, the 
long-haired lower figure, bends almost to a prone position, as if she has been crawling on the 
ground.  She faces down and we see only the top and side of her head.  Her right leg is drawn up
under her and her left is 
extended behind.  Her visible arm is extended under her head on the ground.  Adam's body is
bent over hers.  His legs are spread and he clasps his head in his arms.  The two bent bodies and the 
flames form concentric arches.  The flames rise to the top right corner of the plate and through
the spaces between the lines of the title and subtitle.  An ascending bird 
spreads its wings in the area to the right of the first &quot;Of&quot; (line 2).  The initial &quot;S,&quot; the &quot;N,&quot; and the final 
&quot;S&quot; of &quot;SONGS&quot; (line 1) have extravagant vine-like extensions.  A tiny figure (more distinct in other copies), possibly facing right, stands on the lower, vine-like extension of the first &quot;S&quot; of &quot;SONGS.&quot;  To the right, also on the &quot;S,&quot; is a seated figure, facing right and hunched

					<illusobjdesc>Against a background colored to suggest twilight on the &quot;darkening Green&quot; (line
16), a procession of nine adults and children (including one infant) in a variety of positions
moves 
generally leftward.  Overhead in the branches of two luxuriant, intertwining grape vines that are
rooted at lower right and grow upward along the right margin and left to embrace the stanzas of
the poem, one boy, left, stretches on tiptoe to reach a cluster of grapes on the left while a second
boy, 
right, hands another cluster to a girl who reaches up from the grass below.  Next to her, walking 
left, is a long-haired male in hat and tights; he holds a bunch of grapes (indistinct in this copy) in his extended left hand.  Next in line, a woman looks down at the infant in her arms.  A small child
stands next to the left.  In the center, the tallest figure in the group, perhaps &quot;Old John with white
hair&quot; (Object 5, line 12), points forward with his right hand.  A boy to the left, who faces away
from the viewer, holds a bat at his side with his left hand.  At the front of the procession are a
boy and girl, both looking back toward the rest of the group.  Between them is a kite that the girl
may be holding.  The green tinting of the ground below the playful procession suggests
grass.</illusobjdesc>

heads.  A flock of sheep (somewhat indistinct in this copy) grazes to the left

					<illusobjdesc>A gowned, bearded old man stands, playing a large harp, before an audience of 
perhaps two children—standing in the middle of the group—and six older youths.  He may be the 
bard of the title.  To the left stand two young females who embrace.  To the right stand the 
two children and a group of three gowned females who face the bard.  At their feet, facing them, 
kneels another female.  All the figures appear to be gowned.  The scene is set outdoors on a strip 
of slightly inclined grassy ground with a dark shadow across the foreground.  A palm-like frond arches over 
the head of the figure at far right and the vine in the left margin of the text dangles down into this
major design above the heads of the embracing couple.  The sky is golden yellow behind the bard and on the right and dark blue (a cloud?) just above the embracing couple.</illusobjdesc>

circle.  Clockwise from the left: The two children furthest left (a girl[?] and a short-haired boy) 
stretch something, perhaps a piece of cloth used in a game, between them; a girl raises her arms
horizontally and faces right with legs outspread; a boy raises his arms 
higher, as does the long-haired girl to the right of him, whose leg is extended behind her; holding 
her hand, a boy runs left and reaches forward to hold the hand of another running or striding boy, 
left leg extended behind him, who raises his free left hand as he moves left and back, perhaps 
toward the opening between the pair furthest left.  All the girls wear gowns; all the boys wear 
tight-fitting garments.  These are the &quot;little ones&quot; who &quot;leaped &amp; shouted &amp; laugh'd&quot; (line 16)

					<illusobjdesc>In a grassy landscape, a nude boy with short, curly hair stands in contrapposto in
front of a 
flock of sheep—some grazing, some standing, some lying down.  The boy reaches out to touch(?) 
the nose of one of them—perhaps the &quot;Little Lamb&quot; of the text—with his hands.  Behind the flock
are 
a leafy oak tree with a large trunk (left) and a cottage or barn (right) with an open doorway.  On
its thatched roof perch two birds, often identified as doves.  A dark blue area behind and to the

frame the plate.  Both trees are intertwined with vines that sprout leaves and several loopy
tendrils.  Where
the tree branches meet and intertwine at the top, creating an arch between the title and the text of
the 
poem, they are leafy.  Vines or branches grow across the plate near its midpoint to help fill the

					<illusobjdesc>A lithe and leafy tree, rooted bottom right, grows up the right edge of the plate.  A
vine grows up around its trunk; grape clusters are visible opposite stanzas 6 and 7; at the midway
point the vine seems to produce 
the loopy tendril that terminates near the bird with long tail feathers that ascends to the right of 
stanza 6.  Other birds fly to the right of lines 3, 6, and 12.  The letters of the title are ornamented
with elaborate extensions and flourishes.  The three capital letters, along with the &quot;h&quot; of
&quot;Anothers&quot; (line 1), which is decorated with a kind of forked top
above and a long flag below, and the coil following the final &quot;w,&quot; are the most notable.  The left
margin is dominated by a lattice of branches from two thin trees rooted at bottom left.  
Leafless below, the branches in the upper reaches of the margin carry the suggestion of leaves,
and there are very loopy tendrils beside the first three stanzas that may be a separate vine or part
of the tree.  A figure playing a pipe stands next to the right tree, lower left.  At the piper's feet is an indistinct shape, possibly a dog(?).  A second figure climbs in the branches above, opposite stanza 7.  There is a third figure with arms
raised, appears opposite stanzas 2 and 3, although the figure seems to merge with the tendrils in this
copy.  A fourth human form, left of stanza 1, stands facing right with at least one arm
raised.</illusobjdesc>

						<illusobjdesc>Indeterminate vegetation of various sorts interspersed with tiny human 
figures surrounds the text, especially left, right, and top, and fills spaces between all the stanzas.  
The dominant form is perhaps the vegetation with flame-like leaves that swirls in the spaces of
the 
right margin (with a more conventional leaf or two at bottom right), underneath the title, and
down the left margin.  Tendrils extending from both margins help separate the stanzas from one
another.  The vine right of the final stanza on the plate has several loops suggesting a spiral.  The
vine full of leaves and flowers(?) that extends across the top of the plate above the title
and fills the top right corner and the space right of the first stanza is distinct from the flame-like 
vegetation that dominates the rest of the plate.  Extensions of letters in the title (line 1) contribute to both 
forms of vegetation: the initial &quot;A&quot; and &quot;C&quot; to the vine above, the &quot;S&quot; to both.  In the text of the 
poem, occasional letters have modest decorative extensions, and there are a few bits of stray 
decorative vegetation.</illusobjdesc>

					<illusobjdesc>A serpentine plant-like structure with
flame-like leaves, apparently rooted at right in the strip of grassy ground at bottom right, grows along the ground under the last stanza and then up the left margin.  Between 
stanzas three and four the plant forks.  One part continues up the left margin and ends under the 
title.  Another part of the plant curves between the third and fourth stanzas and crosses into the 
right margin, curves back over the title and ends in an upward flourish at top left.  The large plant 
is encircled in its upper reaches by a leafy vine that is rooted, like the plant itself, at the bottom 
right corner.  From there the vine climbs up the right margin behind the standing figure and then, 
after arching over the figure's head, onto the flame-like plant, which the vine continues to climb 
until it terminates just left of the title.  A second vine, much shorter, appears in front of the plant
at the bottom of the plate, left of the reclining figure.  There are several human 
figures on and around the plants: (at top left) a gowned female with long hair walks right; a
second gowned female with long hair floats behind her, pointing right; two figures kneel side by
side, facing right, hands raised in prayer; (at bottom right) a gowned figure stands, with an arm
extended, perhaps touching the left hand of a nude male figure to the left, who reclines

with hills in the background; sheep graze behind the two figures.  A large tree
dominates the right side of the design; a few leafy branches can be seen top right.  A vine, perhaps ivy,
grows up the trunk.  One or two trees behind the sheep on the left help frame the design.  The
treatment of the sky suggests a sunrise or sunset.  Shadows extend from the shepherd-piper's feet, lower right.</illusobjdesc>

short-haired 
male (behind) and young gowned female (in front) with her hair pulled back in a bun bend over
two 
dead(?) bodies, an old, bearded, gowned(?) male (in front) and a gowned(?) female (behind), who
are laid out on a draped table (possibly a bier) that extends from the left to right edge of the

The corpses are arranged with their heads resting on pillows at left.  The visible (right) arm of the
male is at his side. 
Except for their flesh-colored faces, the two might be taken for tomb effigies.  In the background
is a paneled wall or partition flanked by pilasters—a cemetery wall, tomb, or church interior; on
the right pilaster appears the ostensible date of publication, &quot;1794&quot; (line 4), mostly obscured in this copy by a

a gowned female(?), facing forward, sits on the ground with her legs drawn up and possibly crossed,
probably with head down; directly 
in front of her kneels a child with its right arm about her neck and the left arm on her prominent
right knee; beside her stands another child.  Together the group of figures

					<illusobjdesc>Several varieties of vegetation fill spaces around the text and between stanzas. 
The initial &quot;A&quot; in the title (line 1) sprouts a plant-like structure on the left, while a loopy vine-like
extension dangles all the way down the left margin.  The vegetation in the upper right margin—beside the &quot;m&quot; of &quot;Dream&quot; in the title—seems to be an arc of tasseled 
grass or grain that curves back over the title.  Beneath it—opposite stanzas 1 and 2—are three or
four clusters of flame-like leaves or tufts of grass.  Below those are a bit of leafy vine (after line
10) and a branch or root of some sort (after line 13).  In the lower right margin—opposite stanzas 4 
and 5—is an odd tree(?).  In front of the tree stands a figure, robed, wearing a hat, and holding a
staff—probably the &quot;watchman of the night&quot; (line 17), the glow-worm of the text in human form. 
He is one of four small human figures on the plate.  The other three are in the area of the title:
lying, presumably sleeping, on the left stroke of the initial &quot;A&quot;; sitting, perhaps reading, in the &quot;D&quot; of &quot;Dream&quot;; and
floating or flying, with arms raised horizontally, between bits of vegetation beneath the &quot;e&quot; of
&quot;Dream.&quot;  

The animal life of the poem appears in similarly tiny forms in the margins: there could
be an ant (the &quot;Emmet&quot; of line 4) to the right of line 4, and perhaps another beneath &quot;her&quot; in line 9 (difficult
to see in this copy); a worm or caterpillar nestled 
in the lower right sprigs of the vegetation right of line 6; and winged beetles(?) (lines 19-20) flying right of
lines 5 and 18.  A bird, perhaps an eagle, unmentioned in the text, spreads its wings above
&quot;dream&quot; in line 2.</illusobjdesc>

					<illusobjdesc>The illustration is integrated into a full-plate design by virtue of the implied
presence of ground at the bottom right of the plate, in which vegetation is rooted, and the washes at right, possibly indicating clouds and sky.  The design is focused on two human figures standing in an
embrace under the arching branches of a tall, slender, vine-entwined willow-like tree in the right
margin.  A female in a transparent gown looks right as she points upward with her left arm and
with her right arm embraces a young nude male.  He looks at her and embraces her with at least his left arm.  They may be kissing.  At her feet is a mound of vegetation—apparently a plant with one leaf visible, perhaps an anemone pulsatilla.  The washes filling the area above and to the left of the figures may suggest a sunrise or sunset.  To the left of the treetop a
bird—with a long forked tail and wings spread—ascends.  (The prominent but structurally

roses 
that are dying blossoms or blighted buds—in any case, roses whose life is destroyed by the &quot;dark 
secret love&quot; of the &quot;invisible worm&quot; (lines 8, 3).  One kneels in a severely contracted position
while 
the other lies with her arms wrapped around her lowered head, her gown trailing down along the stem below her. 
Above 
them to the left is a caterpillar with the lower part of his body on the stem and the
upper part resting on a leaf that he may be eating.  Below the poem is a globular rose blossom,
dense 
with petals and near its prime.  In its opening is a figure (probably female) with her arms raised.  (In other copies, the tail of a worm also emerges from the rose blossom, possibly holding the figure; there is only a patch of green coloring here.)  The background
is 
washed, left and right of the rose, to suggest the sky.  The ground is dark and barren, though there is some indeterminate vegetation bottom right.</illusobjdesc>

anything other than interlinear and marginal designs.  Beneath its text, beside a tree with leafless
branches that occupies the right margin, are two figures.  At the base of the tree a gowned female
with long hair reclines, her head apparently supported by her bent left arm.  She may be the pretty
rose tree of the poem.  At her feet, facing right and to the right of a tuft of grass, is a second
figure, wearing tights(?) and sitting (or perhaps kneeling) hunched over in a contracted position. 
This may be the male speaker of the poem who &quot;tend[s]&quot; the rose-tree &quot;by day and by night&quot; (line
7).  He holds his visible hand around his head or on his right shoulder.  In the sky between the
two figures are one large and nine small flying birds.  A vine with several leaves springs from the

					<illusobjdesc>A youthful male nude hovers, perhaps rises, without visible means of support.  His
legs are spread apart, as if striding forward and to the right, and his genitals are visible. 
His body faces forward, but his head is turned to the right; his hair appears to be long.  His arms are bent at
the elbows with his hands together as if in prayer.  He is surrounded with six nude putti or child-angels; at least one (lower left) is holding the central male.  At least four, possibly five, of the putti are winged.  Perhaps
the central figure is a personified spirit rising to heaven.  Some drapery billows between his legs.</illusobjdesc>

winged; at least three are nude.  The putto lower left has one are raised horizontally and holds the
central male's right leg; his companion on the right may be holding his companion above him. 
Four putti are facing up, two probably looking at the central male.  The two putti near the man's
shoulders are facing down; we see only the tops of their heads.  The two middle putti on each
side have their arms raised vertically.  The two lower putti have short
and probably curly hair; the hair of the others is unclear but also appears to be short.</illusobjdesc>
