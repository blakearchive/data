                electronic edition of thirty-three of Blake’s water color illustrations to the
                Bible. All take their subjects from the New Testament and have been added to the
                twenty Old Testament subjects published in March 2010 as “Illustrations to the
                Bible, c. 1780-1824,” under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings. This new
                group is presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the
                Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of
                Blake’s images). <lb/><lb/> Blake executed most of these New Testament water colors c. 1800-05 for his
                patron Thomas Butts. The exceptions are <hi rend="i">The Whore of Babylon</hi> of
                1809 and <hi rend="i">The Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins</hi> in the Yale
                Center for British Art, datable to c. 1825. The subjects range from the childhood of
                Jesus to his ascension, the later history of his parents and one of his major
                followers, St. Paul, and a group of eight designs based on the Book of Revelation.
                While the illustrations of the life of Christ are fairly conventional in their
                subjects, in part because of the long tradition of picturing almost every event in
                the Gospels, individual motifs recall designs in Blake’s illuminated books and thus
                offer a window on Blake’s visual interpretation of the Bible. The illustrations of
                Revelation complement Blake’s intense engagement with apocalyptic events and images
                in his own poetry. <lb/><lb/> The selection of fifty-three biblical water colors now available in the
                Archive will be supplemented in the future with early works, such as <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>, datable to c. 1780, and will continue through Blake’s
                final biblical water colors, such as <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the
                    Bulrushes</hi>. <lb/><lb/> As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access
                restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible by the
                University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with the University of Rochester, the

In the foreground
                        is a group of seven armored male soldiers. The leftmost soldier kneels or
                        crouches, facing right and down. He bends forward or hunches over slightly.
                        His legs are bent underneath him and he wears a sandal on his right foot. He
                        wears a chestplate, but has a cloth shirt and breeches or pants on as well.
                        He has short, slightly curly hair and may be smiling. His right arm is
                        raised horizontally and he may have just thrown the dice with his right
                        hand. His left arm is bent slightly upward, palm out, and he points upward
                        with his left hand. The second-to-left figure has short, curly hair and
                        faces forward and down, bending forward slightly. He may look down or his
                        eyes may be closed. His mouth may be slightly open. His left arm is bent,
                        with his left hand held vertical, palm out. The third-to-left soldier has
                        slightly curly hair and sits, facing left and bending forward slightly to
                        look down. His mouth is partly open. He wears a short-sleeved shirt under
                        his armor. His left leg is extended forward and his left arm is raised
                        horizontally, resting on the table in front of him. His right arm is bent,
                        palm vertical. The solider far right stands, facing left and bending forward
                        to look down. He wears a helmet and holds a halberd (a battle ax with a long
                        handle) that he leans on. He also wears a short-sleeved shirt under his
                        armor and a sandal on his left foot. His right leg is bent, and his left arm
                        is bent upward. There may be a cloth draped over his right wrist. A soldier
                        behind the right-most figure in the group faces left and bends forward to
                        look down so that his face is not visible. He may lean on a halberd that he
                        holds. He wears a cape over his armor. Just above the dice player third from
                        the left sits a soldier, facing left and down. His face is not visible, but
                        he is presumably looking at the dice. He wears a braided hat on his head.
                        Below the chest of the right-most soldier is another soldier visible only as
                        an armored head, facing right and down, with his mouth open. He is
                        presumably looking at the dice as well. Above the group of soldiers on the
                        right are two halberds in addition to the two evidently held by the
                        soldiers. All four halberds probably have wooden handles, like spears. In
                        the middle of the group of soldiers in the foreground is a table or slab of
                        rock covered by a cloth, on which the soldiers throw dice. In the left
                        foreground of the design is what appears to be a sandal. To the left of the
                        leftmost soldier in the foreground are twenty round shapes that may be
                        rocks, bags, or roughly sketched heads that are meant to suggest a crowd. In
                        the middle ground of the design is a mound or low hill, on which stand three
                        wooden crosses. This is Calvary, where Christ was crucified. On the left
                        cross in the is visible a nude body, facing away and to the right. This
                        figure is hanging with its arms raised at 135 degrees. This is one of the
                        thieves crucified with Christ. On the middle cross two nude arms raised at
                        135 degrees are visible, with the figure facing away. This is Christ. In the
                        middle ground on the rightmost cross a nude figure of the second thief is
                        visible, hanging while facing away and to the left. The figure's arms are
                        raised at 135 degrees. To the left of the leftmost cross stands a figure,
                        facing away and to the right. Its gender is indeterminable, but it wears a
                        long gown and has long hair. Between the leftmost and middle cross in the
                        middle ground stand five figures. The leftmost figure is just visible as a
                        head with long hair, facing right. The second-to-left figure is of
                        indeterminable gender, but may be female. She(?) faces right and wears a
                        gown, as well as has long hair. The middle figure of this group is that of
                        an old man with long hair and a beard, facing forward and to the right,
                        while looking up. He may wear a gown. The second-to-right figure is that of
                        a female, probably the Virgin Mary or one of the other Marys at the
                        crucifixion, facing forward and right, and looking up. She wears a veil over
                        her hair and has a long gown. The rightmost figure is just suggested as the
                        back of a head, facing right and perhaps away. Between the central and
                        rightmost cross in the middle ground stands a group of at least seven
                        figures. The leftmost figure has long hair and a gown, and may be facing
                        away. The second-to-left figure is that of a gowned female with long hair,
                        who faces left and down. Her left arm is bent upward and she may hold her
                        hand to her face. Her mouth may be open. This may be one of the Marys
                        present at the crucifixion. The third-to-left figure may be that of a male
                        with long hair, facing forward and looking up and to the left. The middle
                        figure of this group may be that of a gowned female with long hair, facing
                        away and to the left. Her left arm may be bent upward. She may be one of the
                        Marys present at the crucifixion. The third-to-right figure of this group
                        may be that of a male with a beard, facing forward and looking up and to the
                        left. The second-to-right figure is that of a gowned female with long hair,
                        who faces away but looks forward and up to the left. Her mouth is open. She
                        may have a hood on her gown. She may be one of the Marys at the crucifixion.
                        The rightmost figure is just visible as a head with long hair, facing to the
                        left or possibly away. It may be gowned. There might be another figure to
                        the right, only hinted at. In the background is a group of buildings. To the
                        left is a tower with an archway and portcullis. A stone(?) wall supports a
                        group of figures. Above the wall rises what appears to be a Gothic(?)
                        building with spires and arches. A crowd of at least eighteen figures,
                        visible only as roughly sketched outlines of heads and upper bodies, stands
                        on the wall in the background. These figures face forward, with the leftmost
                        group facing slightly right and the rightmost group facing slightly left.
                        They may be looking at the crucified figures. This scene appears to take
                        place at night and is dark. The sky is cloudy with a pink wash that may
                        suggest sunrise or sunset. A glow in the sky around the middle cross may
                        suggest the sun, or be an aura emanating from Christ. </illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="CD"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>soldier</characteristic><characteristic>armor</characteristic><characteristic>kneeling</characteristic><characteristic>crouching</characteristic><characteristic>bending forward</characteristic><characteristic>hunched over</characteristic><characteristic>leaning</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>facing down</characteristic><characteristic>legs bent</characteristic><characteristic>sandal</characteristic><characteristic>shirt</characteristic><characteristic>pants</characteristic><characteristic>breeches</characteristic><characteristic>short hair</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>smiling</characteristic><characteristic>throwing</characteristic><characteristic>playing</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised horizontally</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>pointing</characteristic><characteristic>palm out</characteristic><characteristic>hand raised, palm out</characteristic><illusobjdesc>In the foreground of this design is a group of seven armored
