            <updatestmt> 
                Blake’s experiences in the London social circle of the Rev. A. S. Mathew and his wife Harriet in the 1780s gave him both inspiration and opportunities.  <hi rend="i">An Island in the Moon</hi>, a 
                manuscript fragment that includes poems and songs in wacky satirical contexts, is an early vehicle for his impressions of the Mathew circle.  <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi> is a more serious, in some respects major, literary experiment that grew out of the accumulated earlier efforts of this multi-talented engraver’s apprentice to write poems and poetic prose sketches some of which he later probably recited and sang in company.  The Mathews must have been impressed, because they joined with the artist and sculptor John Flaxman to subsidize the printing, in 1783, of Blake's first and only typographical collection of poetry.  (For what is known about the printing, see the note under Publisher on the Copy Information page.) It was a rudimentary printing job rather than a formally published volume: perhaps fifty copies of eleven sheets that could be folded and assembled into small volumes with a title page presenting "W. B." as author followed by a one page, unsigned "Advertisement" for these displays of "poetic originality, which merited some respite from oblivion" (Object 2). 
                The uncorrected sheets were apparently left in Blake’s hands to do with as he saw fit, which, surprisingly, was nothing more than to present individual volumes to friends and patrons now and then throughout his life.   He (and others) variously corrected and emended some copies but left others untouched.  Only about half&#8212;at the latest count twenty-four&#8212;survive.

                <lb/>
                Despite its somewhat unpromising origins, <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi> remains vitally important in its revelations of Blake’s reading habits and early accomplishments&#8212;several fine poems, including the often anthologized "I Lov'd the Jocund Dance" and "How Sweet I Roam'd from Field to Field"&#8212;along with strong anticipations of his developing styles and interests.  The collection materializes at a productive literary intersection of Elizabethan and neoclassical poetics, biblical allusion, late eighteenth-century innovations, emergent romantic modes, and idiosyncratic mythopoeic genius.  A Shakespearean invocation to the muse begins "King Edward the Third," while it, along with "Edward IV" and "King John," sets a tone similar to Shakespeare's history plays.  The stimulus of popular eighteenth century poems&#8212;James Thomson's <hi rend="i">The Seasons</hi> (finished in 1730), Edward Young's <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi>, and James Macpherson's pseudo-medieval Ossian poems&#8212;can be felt. And, of course, Blake’s key predecessor John Milton leaves his mark, particularly in "Contemplation" and "Samson." 
                <lb/>
                <lb/>
                Although the earliest works may have been drafted when Blake was an "untutored youth" (Advertisement Object 2), the collection conveys a powerful sense of the original author
                he was fast becoming.  His visionary or prophetic mode ("Gwin, King of Norway"), his underlying social and political commitments (in the ironic "King Edward the Third"), and his easy assimilation of new literary trends (the gothic "Fair Elinor") are all evident.  As miscellaneous as it is, <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi> anticipates the major literary work soon to come.

                    <note>The work was printed but never formally published.</note>
                    <note>According to John Thomas Smith, the print run was funded by John Flaxman and the Rev. 
Anthony Stephen Mathew, the latter having been persuaded by his wife to join Flaxman in the 
endeavor (*Nollekens and His Times*, 1828, quoted in Bentley, *Records* page 605). Smith 
also claims Rev. Mathew may have then written the advertisement (page 605). Noting the 
potential unreliability of Smith's account, Bentley surmises that Flaxman's aunt and uncle, Jane 
and John Matthews (unrelated to Rev. Mathew but printsellers and publishers themselves), may 
have contributed to or consulted on the printing of *Poetical Sketches* ("John Flaxman and the 
Mathew Clan," *Bulletin of the New York Public Library* 67 [1963]: 443-54). Michael Phillips, who also questions 
Smith's accuracy, proposes that the printer was John Nichols based on typographic similarities 
between *Poetical Sketches* and other works printed by Nichols, as well as mutual friends 
connecting Flaxman to Nichols ("William Blake and the 'Unincreasable Club': The Printing of 
*Poetical Sketches*," *Bulletin of the New York Public Library* 80 [1976]: 6-18). Furthermore,
Phillips mentions that Blake could have been acquainted with Nichols through his apprenticeship
to Basire, but that Flaxman's association with three of Nichols' friends (
each of whom received a copy of *Poetical Sketches*) perhaps allowed Flaxman to arrange the printing of *Sketches* 
with Nichols (pages 13-17).

                            Erdman notes this correction was made in four copies (847). Essick indicates that the "s" in this copy is struck through with pen and ink,  
                            and in Copy S it is rubbed out (*Huntington* pages 177-78). Essick also notes that the "s" is rubbed out in Copy Y ("Blake in the Marketplace, 2011," *Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly* 45.4 [spring 2012], page 119).

                            replaced with "behold" in pen and ink. Erdman states that this revision was made in six copies (847). Essick notes this change also occurs in Copy Y, 
                            and specifies that "I am" is scraped off and replaced with "behold" in Copies S and Y (*Huntington* page 178) ("Blake in the Marketplace, 2011," *Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly*, 45.4 [spring 2012], page 119).

                            Essick specifies that in Copy S, the left vertical of the "u" from "unfold" is scraped off and the right vertical is dotted as an "i" (*Huntington* page 178). 
                            Essick documents the same change is made in Copy Y ("Blake in the Marketplace, 2011," *Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly*, 45.4 [spring 2012], page 119).

                            Erdman notes that this correction occurs in seven copies (847). Essick indicates that in this copy, "beds" has been struck through with horizontal lines and "birds" has been written in pen and ink above the line (*Huntington* page 177). 
                            Essick documents the same change for Copy Y ("Blake in the Marketplace, 2011," *Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly*, 45.4 [spring 2012], page 119).
