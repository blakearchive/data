            <updatestmt>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of a fully searchable electronic edition of Blake’s water color illustrations to Dante’s 
                <hi rend="i">Divine Comedy</hi>
                . The Archive first published these in January 2005 in our Preview mode. This republication substantially increases the number and range of Blake’s pictorial motifs available for searching on the Archive. The 7 engravings illustrating Dante’s poem continue to be available in the Archive in Preview mode.

                Along with the illustrations to Edward Young’s 
                <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi>
                , the poetry of Thomas Gray, and John Milton’s poems, the 102 Dante water colors are among Blake’s most important series of illustrations of another poet. They were commissioned by John Linnell, the chief patron of Blake’s final years. Although Linnell did not begin to pay for the designs until December 1825, at the rate of about 1 pound a week, Blake probably began work on the drawings by the fall of 1824. They were left at Blake’s death in 1827 in various stages of completion, ranging from pencil sketches to highly finished water colors. Most show an expressive freedom in the handling of color washes far greater than Blake’s earlier works in that medium.  In 1826, Blake began to engrave large plates based on 7 of the designs; these were also left incomplete at his death. The water colors remained in Linnell’s collection and estate until their sale at auction in 1918. Through a scheme organized by the National Art Collections Fund, they were dispersed among 7 participating institutions: Ashmolean Museum (3 designs), Birmingham Museums &amp; Art Gallery (6 designs), British Museum (13 designs), Fogg Art Museum (23 designs) National Gallery of Victoria (36 designs), Royal Institution of Cornwall (1 design), and Tate Collection (20 designs). The Archive has brought this dispersed group of water colors together. The digital lightbox feature enables users to compare images within the series and with all other works in the Archive.

                    <illusobjdesc>A gowned male representing Dante appears in the left half of the design. He is seen from behind with his head turned to the right and he likely looks toward the animals to the right. Dante's right leg is bent and his left leg is extended backward with the left foot raised on tiptoe; he strides or runs to the left, fleeing from the animals. The figure's arms are raised at 135 degrees and the palms of both hands are held vertically. A gowned male representing Virgil flies or hovers in the left half of the design. Both arms are raised at 45 degrees and the palms of both hands are turned out towards the viewer. Virgil faces forward with his head turned down slightly; he may look towards the animals pictured to the right. A female wolf with spiky fur stands on a hill in the upper right portion of the design. The wolf has six visible swollen teats. Its mouth is open with the teeth bared and tongue extended. A male lion stands in the right half of the design. Its mouth is open with the teeth visible. A leopard stands in a crouched position in the lower right portion of the design. Mottled coloring on the leopard's body suggests spots. The leopard faces left with its head turned up; its mouth is open with the tongue extended. The trunks of two leafy trees appear above a hill in the upper right portion of the design. An ivy vine climbs up the trunk of the tree on the left in this group. A third tree trunk appears at the left border and divides into several leafy branches that arch to the right. A leafy vine rises along the tree trunk and a thorny vine rests on the ground to the right. A leafy plant appears in lower right, just left of the lion. The plant arches to the left and nine flower buds or berries appear along its stem. A body of water, likely the sea, appears in the lower half of the design. Small waves are visible throughout. The disc of the sun appears on the horizon; it may be sunrise or sunset. Beams of light radiate outward through the sky and three stars appear to the left. The setting is the wilderness, or dark wood, in which Dante wanders.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>God sits or crouches in the upper half of the design. His right leg is bent and drawn up and his right foot may be raised on tiptoe. God's left leg is bestial and ends in a cloven hoof. Both arms are raised horizontally and God holds a snake-like spiral (of smoke?) in each hand. A gowned male with short hair and a spiked crown kneels on a step in the upper portion of the design. The figure is seen from behind with his head turned to the right in profile. His right eye is raised and he looks up at God. A large Maltese cross with a fleur-de-lis finial and smaller crosses and rectangular and fleur-de-lis motifs appear on the figure's gown. Some of the rectangular shapes may be buildings with central towers. Both legs are bent and the soles of his feet are turned out towards the viewer. Both arms are raised at 45 degrees; the forefinger of his left hand is extended and he may point downward. In his right hand he holds a censer suspended by four chains; smoke rises from the censer. Arched bands of color in the upper portion of the design suggests a rainbow; the heads and shoulders of several figures are lightly sketched within the rainbow. A gowned female with long hair sits at a spinning wheel in the upper left portion of the design within a cave-like bower. A distaff wound with a skein of thread rises from the spinning wheel. A rectangular mirror appears above; the reflection of the woman's hair is visible on its surface. Three leafy trees, possibly with a grape vine, arch above. A gowned male representing Dante stands in the lower portion of the design. He is seen from behind with his head turned down and to the left. Dante's mouth is open and his expression suggests fear or surprise. His legs are spread apart and at least his right leg is bent. His left foot is raised on tiptoe and he may stride away from the viewer. Dante's arms are raised at 45 degrees and the palms of both hands are turned down. A gowned male representing Virgil stands on a hill or mound in the lower left portion of the design. His eyes are cast down and he looks towards Dante. Virgil's right arm is down at his side and his left arm is bent upward; the palm of his left hand is turned out towards the viewer with the fingers spread slightly. The heads of three beasts appear in the lower portion of the design, to the left of Dante. From top to bottom they may represent a tiger, wolf, and dog. All three animals face right and look towards Dante. The wolf's mouth is open with the teeth visible. Green coloring in the lower half of the design indicates grass. Branches and leaves visible above the heads of three animals suggests trees. Additional leaves appear on the ground below. A giant nude male sits or crouches in the lower left portion of the design. The figure faces forward and his body is surrounded by blue flames. His arms are bent and the figure's hands rest together on his knees with the palms turned down. A giant nude male with short, curly hair sits or crouches in the lower right portion of the design. The figure faces forward and his body is surrounded by flames and smoke; dark shapes on the figure's body may indicate ash. His arms are down at his sides and his hands rest on the ground. Shackles appear on the figure's wrists; a single chain link is visible at the right wrist. A dark cloud or perhaps smoke arches above the figures in the lower half of the design. Rose, yellow, and blue wash below the cloud belt may indicate a sky at sunrise or sunset. Three female spirits fly or hover among the clouds. The figure furthest left is positioned horizontally. Her left arm extends horizontally to the right; the palm of her left hand is turned up and she may reach towards the figure to the right. The figure second from the left is seen from behind and is partly upside down with her legs extended upward. She faces left with her head turned up and her eyes raised; she looks towards the figures above. Her mouth may be open slightly. The figure furthest right faces forward with her head turned to the left. The figure's left leg is bent and her ankles are crossed with the right foot prominent. Her arms are bent and the palms of both hands are turned out towards the viewer with the fingers spread. The setting may be the entry into hell.</illusobjdesc>

The figure to the left, likely Virgil, stands with his arms bent upward; the palms of both hands are turned out with the fingers spread. His legs are bent slightly and he may walk away from the viewer. His head is turned to the right and he looks toward Dante. Dante stands with his right leg bent and the right foot raised on tiptoe; he may walk away from the viewer. The figure's arms are down at his sides and the palms of both hands are turned down. His head is turned to the left and he looks toward Virgil. The figures stand in a forest; the trunks of two trees rise to the left and two more to the right. Each trunk divides into several leafy branches. Dark wash between the trees suggests shadows. Green coloring at the lower border indicates grass. The setting is Dante's dark wood or wilderness.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Two gowned males with long hair stand in the lower portion of the design. Both figures are seen from behind. The figure to the left, likely Dante, stands with his right leg bent and his right foot raised on tiptoe; he likely walks away from the viewer. Dante's head is turned up and to the left in profile; he may look towards the archway above. The figure's left arm is raised vertically and the palm of his left hand is turned up. His right arm is raised at 45 degrees with the palm of his right hand turned down. The figure to the right, likely Virgil, stands with his left leg bent and his left foot raised above the ground; he likely walks away from the viewer. Virgil's head is turned to the left and he looks over his left shoulder towards Dante. Virgil's right arm is raised at 135 degrees and the palm of his right hand is turned out, away from the viewer. His left arm is down and he might hold Dante's right wrist. Dante and Virgil stand at the threshold of hell, marked by a large archway. The arch is slightly misshapen and may be a natural stone formation. The lower left portion of the threshold is cast in shadow. The trunks of two leafy trees with large visible roots stand to the left and right of the archway. Branches are visible among the leaves of each tree. Green coloring below indicates grass. The distant area visible within the archway represents hell. A body of water, possibly the river Acheron, extends horizontally across the lower portion of the design. Four dark or shadowed hills, probably representing the circles of hell, rise above the river. Flames appear throughout. Several indistinct figures, perhaps six in total, appear among the distant hills in the center of the design. One figure's arms are raised at 135 degrees.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Dante and Virgil stand on a small hill or step in the lower right corner of the design. The step is cast in dark shadow and spiky shape near the base of the step may represent a leaf or other indeterminate vegetation. Dante faces forward with his head turned to the left and his mouth may be open slightly. Dante's right arm is bent; his left arm is not visible, but is also likely bent. The palms of both hands are held vertically. Virgil stands to the right of Dante; he faces forward with his head turned to the right in profile. As many as seventeen figures appear across the lower portion of the design.  A male wearing tights or breeches and a shirt stands furthest left. The figure is seen from behind with his head turned up and to the right. His legs are spread apart and his right foot is raised on tiptoe. Two worms wrap around his calves. A sword hangs in a scabbard at his left hip; the scabbard is likely attached to a belt. The figure holds a flagpole with both hands; the flag is triangular, but with two decorative loops, and points to the right. A female with short, curly hair stands second from the left. Her eyes are raised and her mouth is open with the upper row of teeth visible; the figure's expression may suggest despair. She wears a shirt or gown with lacing visible below her breasts. Her garment is torn at her left hip and two daggers or knives appear at her left side. Red coloring along her torso and legs suggests blood. The figure wears a spiked crown, a beaded or pearl necklace with a cross, and two bracelets. A worm wraps around her right ankle and another may appear at her left knee. Both arms are raised vertically and the palms of both hands are turned out towards the viewer. The figures third through sixth from the left in this group all face left, with heads lowered.  Three have their hands covering their faces. The figure seventh from the left wears a torn shirt or tunic. His left arm is bent upward and his left hand covers his face. A bag, purse, or other object hangs from the figure's belt.  Two pistols are strapped above his belt. A small object, possibly another gun, is belted around his left calf and a worm rises above his left ankle. A gowned female with long hair stands tenth from the left. The figure wears a crown. A stoppered vial hangs from a string or thread near her left hip. Only the upper bodies of the five figures furthest right are visible. At least seven worms appear on the ground and perhaps eight additional worms wrap around the legs of several figures. A multitude of wasps or hornets flies above. A series stairs or steps appears in the central right portion of the design. A large stone, perhaps a cliffside, rises above. The stone resembles a head turned to the left in profile with its mouth open. Eleven distinct figures stand on the stairs in the central right portion of the design; other indistinct shapes likely represent the heads of additional figures. The figure furthest left is nude and faces left in profile; his head is turned down and his left hand covers his face. The figure third from the left faces forward with his or her head turned up and mouth open. The figure fourth from the left is seen from behind with his(?) arms down at his sides and the palms of his hands turned down. The figure fifth from the left may hold his or her hands together in prayer. A nude male with long hair and a beard stands sixth from the left; his legs are bent and he may walk to the left. The figures seventh and eighth from the left likely descend the staircase. A gowned male with long hair and a beard stands ninth from the left, elevated slightly above the group; his arms are bent upward with the palms held vertically. The figure tenth from the left crouches slightly and the figure furthest right is seen from behind. Three nude(?) figures appear on the cliff face above. The upper figure straddles the stone with his or her right leg dangling downward. Both arms are bent upward. The figure second from the top stands(?) with his or her left arm raised vertically. The lowest figure of the group is upside down and may be falling; his or her head is not visible and the figure's legs may be bent. Dark water in the center of the design represents the river Acheron. Charon sits in a sail boat near the leftmost shore of the river. The figure's right arm is bent and he holds an oar in his right hand; he is likely rowing the boat across the river. A stone or brick wall rises in several tiers above the left shore of the river. Above the wall are two(?) roofed buildings; above them is another structure or a flat-topped hill. Two figures, probably devils, stand above the wall in the upper left portion of the design. Both figures are cast in dark shadow and they may be winged. The figure to the right stands with his or her left leg bent and the left foot raised on tiptoe; the figure may walk to the left. At least one arm is bent upward and the figure may hold a staff or other object. A multitude of gowned figures stand left of the wall. They face left and many figures have at least one leg bent; they likely walk to the left. The figures along the left border are distinguished only by their heads and they may be seen from behind. Blue wash in the upper portion of the design indicates sky. Red coloring in the upper left may suggest a fire. Smoke or perhaps a cloud extends along the upper border; at least fourteen gowned figures appear within the cloud. Many of the figures are indistinct. A female stands second from the left with her arms bent upward and her hands held beside her head. A male third from the left is seen from behind and may embrace the figure to the right. An old male with long hair and a beard stands sixth from the left; both arms are bent upward and the palms of his hands are turned up. A female eighth from the left bends forward slightly with her head turned down; she may run or walk to the right. The setting is the entry into hell.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The scene takes place in hell. Grey wash in the lower portion of the design represents the river Acheron. A boat appears on the river in the center of the design. A sail and a rope wrap around the mast and the boat is moored with a heavy rope to a large ring on a pier or other structure to the right. A male figure representing Charon stands on the gunwale of the boat. The figure has long hair and a beard. His mouth is open and he may be speaking or shouting. Charon wears a skirt and an open shirt or coat. Both legs are bent and spread apart; his left foot is raised on tiptoe and he may walk or stride to the right. His arms are raised vertically and he holds an oar in his left hand. The palm of his right hand is held vertically with the fingers spread slightly. The heads and upper bodies of at least fourteen figures are visible in the left half of Charon's boat. Many of the figures are lightly sketched and have no discernible features. A nude male in the upper left braces against the gunwale with his right arm bent. His head is turned up and to the right with his mouth open; his expression suggests fear or despair. Below and to the right, a nude female(?) sits or reclines with both legs bent and drawn up. Two gowned figures stand on a hill in the upper right portion of the design; they likely represent Dante and Virgil. The figure to the left has long hair. He faces forward and his right arm is raised at 45 degrees with the palm of his right hand turned down. The figure to the right faces left and his left arm may be bent. At least eight gowned figures stand above the pier in the upper right portion of the design. The figures are lightly sketched. The three figures furthest left are hunched over. The figure third from the left has the left arm bent and wrapped around his or her head. A male with long hair and a beard stands fourth from the left. Both arms are raised at 135 degrees and the palms of both hands may be turned up. A figure huddles fifth from the left with both arms raised beside his or her face. The figure sixth from the left may have a mustache or beard; both arms are bent upward with the palms turned up. A female with flame-like hair stands seventh from the left; both arms are bent upward. The features of the figure furthest right are not clearly visible. A mountain rises above the river in the left portion of the design. Though not clearly pictured, a wall may appear below the mountain in the lower left portion of the design. The roof of a building appears above the wall; another building appears further up the mountain. Two indistinct figures, perhaps devils, sit on a mountain in the upper left portion of the design. The figures may be winged or are perhaps surrounded by flames. A shepherd's crook appears to the right of each figure; though not clearly pictured, the figures may hold the shepherd's crooks. The figure to the left sits with his or her left leg dangling over the mountain's edge. A group of indistinct figures appears along the left border of the design; they may be seen from behind and climb or ascend the wall and mountainside. Only the heads of several figures are visible. The lower figure stands with his or her right leg bent and left arm raised vertically. Blue wash in the upper right portion of the design indicates sky; white space to the left suggests clouds.</illusobjdesc>

His head is turned up and to the right with his mouth open; his expression suggests fear or despair. Below and to the right, a nude female(?) sits or reclines with both legs bent and drawn up.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The scene is set in hell. A series of four(?) arches appear in the center of the design; the may represent the circles of hell. A rocky cliff face rises along the left border. Light shadows appear along the cliff. A gowned figure representing Dante lies or reclines on the upper portion of the cliff. His eyes are closed and he may be sleeping. Both legs are bent and Dante's right foot is prominent. His arms are not clearly pictured. Virgil kneels or crouches above. His head is turned down and he likely looks at Dante below. Both arms are down and he may reach for or touch Dante with his left hand. A gowned male representing Homer stands in the lower portion of the design. The figure has a long beard and wears a crown or wreath of laurel leaves. He faces forward with his head turned slightly left and looks at the figure to the left. Both feet are visible and Homer's right foot is raised on tiptoe; he likely walks forward towards the viewer. His right arm is down at his side and he holds a sword in his right hand. Six lightly sketched figures appear in the lower portion of the design, three to either side of Homer. The figure furthest left is gowned and has short hair. The figure is seen from behind and leans sharply to the right with his or her head turned up. The figure's right foot may be raised on tiptoe. His or her right arm is raised at 45 degrees with the palm held vertically towards Homer. A gowned male with short hair and a beard appears second from the left; he may be standing, flying, or hovering. The figure's head is turned up slightly. His right arm is down at his side and his left arm may be bent. He may hold the curved object, perhaps a lyre, pictured at his left side. A gowned male with long hair and a beard stands third from the left. He wears a crown or wreath of laurel leaves. He is seen from behind with his head turned to the right in profile. The figure's mouth may be open and his right eye is raised; he looks towards Homer to the right. The figure stands with his right leg bent and his right foot raised on tiptoe. His left arm is bent upward and the palm of his left hand is turned down slightly. His right arm is bent and he may reach for or touch Homer's sword. The figure third from the right is gowned and has long, curly hair. The figure is seen from behind with his or her head turned up and to the left. The figure may be standing, flying, or hovering. His or her right arm is raised at 45 degrees. A gowned figure flies or hovers second from the right. He or she may be blindfolded. The figure's right arm is down and he or she holds an open book. A gowned figure flies or hovers furthest right. The figure's features are indistinct, but he or she appears to face left. The figure's left arm is raised at 45 degrees. His or her right arm may be bent upward, or is perhaps raised horizontally. Several lightly sketched figures, perhaps seven or eight in total, fly or hover within the outer arch on the left. The lowest figure raises a single arm vertically. Above, a figure appears with both arms raised horizontally. The figure third from the bottom may cradle a smaller figure, perhaps a child or infant. Three or four figures above are indistinct. A circle upper right with lines of radiance may represent the sun, although it is inscribed &quot;Purgatory.&quot;  The two outermost arches bear inscriptions, as does the space above them (see the Textual Transcription).</illusobjdesc>

                <illustration location="E" type="plate">
                    <illusobjdesc>The scene is set in hell. The ground at the lower border of the design is covered with grass and a few scattered leaves. A thick forest of leafy trees appears across the lower half of the design and rises along the cliff to the right. The roots of a tree in the lower right are prominent and the branches of several trees are also visible. Dark wash throughout the design indicates sky; a thick band of clouds or perhaps smoke extends horizontally across the upper portion of the image. A rocky cliff rises in the right half of the design. Two gowned males with long hair stand at the edge of the cliff. The figure to the left represents Dante. He faces left with his head turned down slightly; he likely looks down at the figures below. Both arms are bent and his hands are raised with the palms held vertically. The figure to the right represents Virgil. He faces slightly left and may look towards Dante. Virgil's left arm is bent and the palm of his left hand may be held vertically. Two steps or plinths rising above the trees at the left border of the design suggests an altar; a fire burns on the upper step. A gowned male with long hair and a beard stands to the right of the fire. The figure faces left in profile. His left arm is bent and he holds a vase, censer, or other vessel; smoke rises from the vase. Seventeen nude figures fly or hover in the sky in the center of the design. Seven figures are apparently female, identifiable by long hair or exposed breasts; they may be the mothers of the ten children and infants within the group. Five gowned males stand in the lower left portion of the design; they likely represent the ancient poets, although only four (Homer, Horace, Ovid, and Lucan) are named in the poem. Each poet wears a spiky crown or vegetative wreath and three of the figures have long beards. The central figure is probably Homer. From left to right, the figures hold a book, scroll, sword, and lyre; the figure furthest right is partially obscured by a tree trunk. Two gowned figures with long hair stand beneath the clouds or smoke in the lower right portion of the design. Each figure holds and likely plays an instrument; the figure to the left holds a lyre at his or her side and the figure to the right holds a horn to his or her lips. The head of the figure to the left is turned up and he or she likely looks towards the figure to the right. Further down and to the right is a figure with long hair lying prone on the ground, facing down. The figure's left leg is extended, perhaps obscuring the right leg, and the left arm may be bent above or under the figure's head. Three lightly sketched figures sit or kneel together in the lower right portion of the design. The figures may lean against each other.</illusobjdesc>

The female to the right cradles an infant in her bent right arm and may hold hands with the child to the right. Below, a female appears with her arms raised at 45 degrees; she touches or holds the arm of the child below. To the right, a female appears with both arms bent and her head turned to the right; she may hold hands with the child to the right. Below, a female faces left with her head turned up; her right arm is raised at 45 degrees and she reaches for the child above and to the left. She may also hold hands with the child to the right. Below and to the left, a female is seen from behind with the buttocks prominent. Her left arm is bent upward and she holds the infant pictured above; the infant's arms are raised at 135 degrees. To the right, a female cradles an infant with her right arm and may hold hands with the child to the right.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The scene is set in hell. A sea or river of fire is visible in the middle distance, with flames rising in the lower left. A large platform, wall, or step rises above the fiery water. The upper and left portions of the sky are filled with dark clouds or smoke. Five lightning bolts appear below the clouds. Dante stands on a hill or mound in the lower left portion of the design. He faces forward and slightly right. His left arm is bent at his side and the palm of his left hand is turned out towards the viewer. Dante's right arm is raised at 135 degrees and his right hand rests on Virgil's shoulder. Virgil faces right in profile with his head turned up slightly. His left leg is bent and his right leg extends backward with the right foot raised on tiptoe; he likely strides to the right up the hill. The figure's right arm is raised at 135 degrees. His right hand is raised and he may point upward with his right forefinger extended. Virgil's left arm is raised at 45 degrees and he holds or touches Dante with his left hand. A nude male with long hair and a beard sits on a flaming throne in the center of the design. He wears a crown and represents king Minos. He looks to the left and his mouth is open with the teeth visible. Minos sits with both legs bent and his left foot raised on tiptoe. His right arm is bent upward and the palm of his right hand turned out towards the viewer with the fingers spread slightly. His left arm is bent and he holds a spear in his left hand. A serpent's tail rises above Minos's left shoulder. The throne rests atop three stairs or steps forming a plinth and dark smoke rises above. The heads of four figures appear within the smoke. Each figure has long hair and their heads are surrounded by halo-like circles. A nude female with long, flame-like hair flies or hovers in the left portion of the design. A halo is visible around her head. The figure faces down with her head turned up. Her body is positioned horizontally with the right leg extended upward. The figure's left arm is raised horizontally and she points to the right with her left forefinger extended. Her right arm is raised vertically and she holds the hair of the figure above; she may pull him downward. The male figure is upside down and his face is obscured. His lower body is dark, perhaps suggesting shadow. Both legs are bent and the figure's right leg is drawn up sharply. Both arms are bent and may wrap around his head. A nude figure with long hair kneels or perhaps crawls on the ground below Minos. The figure is seen from behind with his or her buttocks prominent. Both hands are raised beside the figure's head. A gowned female(?) with long hair kneels below Minos. The figure is seen from behind and both legs are bent with the soles of her feet turned out towards the viewer. The figure's head is down and may rest on the step below Minos's throne. Her left arm is raised horizontally and her right arm is raised at 135 degrees; the palms of both hands are held vertically. A nude female with short hair kneels in the lower right portion of the design. She is seen partly from behind with her buttocks prominent; her upper body is twisted forward slightly with the right breast exposed and her head is turned to the left. She may try to escape or turn away from the male figure to the right. The female's mouth is open and her teeth may be visible. Both legs are bent and her right leg is drawn up beneath her. Her right arm is down and her right hand may rest on the ground with the palm turned up. Her left arm is raised at 135 degrees and the palm of her left hand is turned up. A nude male with short, curly hair flies or hovers to the right. A faint halo appears around his head and he may be smiling. The figure may have dark wings and the fingers of his right hand are claw-like; he may represent a demon. The figure's body is positioned horizontally with his legs extended to the right. His upper body is twisted and his left arm is raised horizontally; he holds or embraces the female to the left. A nude female with long hair flies or hovers in the right portion of the design. She faces slightly right with her breasts exposed. Her head is bent back and to the left; her head may rest on her shoulder and her expression suggests despair. The figure's arms are bent upward and the palms of both hands are turned up. Both legs are bent. A nude male with long hair flies or hovers to the right. He is seen from behind with the buttocks prominent. The figure's head is turned up and to the right and a lightly sketched halo is visible around his head. Both legs are bent and the soles of his feet are turned out towards the viewer. His left arm is bent up and he holds or embraces the female above. The heads of two male(?) figures with short hair appear within the fiery river in the lower right portion of the design. The lower figure may be frowning and the upper figure's mouth is open; his expression suggests fear.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The scene is set in hell. Fire appears along the lower border of the design; dark wash among the flames represents smoke. A grassy bank or ledge appears above the flames in the right half of the design. A whirlwind of fire rises from the lower right to the upper left corner; the column forms a single loop. A second column of fire rises above the grassy bank, extending up and to the right. Dark blue wash throughout the design indicates sky. The sun appears in the upper right corner; beams of light radiate outward. A gowned male representing Virgil stands on the grassy ledge. Virgil has long hair and his head is turned down; he likely looks toward Dante, below. Virgil's arm are down at his sides and the palms of both hands are turned down. Dante lies supine on the grassy ledge. His body is positioned horizontally with his head to the right. His eyes are closed; he has fainted. Dante's left arm rests on the ground and the palm of his left hand is turned down. Two figures fly or hover within the column of fire and wind pictured above Dante. The figure to the right is a gowned female with long hair. She likely represents Francesca da Rimini. Francesca faces forward with her upper body twisted to the left. Her left arm is bent upward; she reaches for and may touch the male pictured to the left. Francesca's head is turned up and her mouth may be open. Her eyes are raised and she looks at her companion. The figure to the left is a nude male with short hair. He likely represents Paolo Malatesta. Paolo is seen from behind with his upper body twisted to the right. Both legs are bent slightly and his buttocks are prominent. Paolo's right arm is raised at 45 degrees; he reaches for and may touch the female pictured to the right. At least thirty-seven nude figures fly or hover within a large column of flame rising from the lower right to the upper left corner of the design. The column forms a single loop and the figures are likely rising upward as if blown by a wind. Seven figures are seen from behind with their buttocks prominent. Four on the right side of the loop are positioned upside down. At least ten figures are clearly female with exposed breasts. The figures in the upper left are less distinct than the lower figures. Two figures in the upper section of the loop are kissing; the arms of the upper figure at raised horizontally. A male in the lower left points upward with his left arm raised at 135 degrees. A figure near the lower border faces forward with his or her hands raised beside her head; the figure's mouth is open and his or her expression suggests fear or pain. A male to the right displays a wide-eyed expression suggesting surprise. A female with long hair appears in a twisted position in the lower right; both legs are bent and her arms are wrapped around her body. Two figures in the lower right are indistinct; only the head of the upper figure is visible. Two lightly sketched nude figures kneel within the disc of the sun in the upper right corner of the design. The female(?) figure to the right is seen from behind. The figures embrace and are likely kissing. They probably represent Francesca da Rimini (on the right?) and Paolo Malatesta (on the left?).</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>At least thirty-seven nude figures fly or hover within a large column of flame rising from the lower right to the upper left corner of the design. The column forms a single loop and the figures are likely rising upward as if blown by a wind. Seven figures are seen from behind with their buttocks prominent. Four on the right side of the loop are positioned upside down. At least ten figures are clearly female with exposed breasts. The figures in the upper left are less distinct than the lower figures. Two figures in the upper section of the loop are kissing; the arms of the upper figure at raised horizontally. A male in the lower left points upward with his left arm raised at 135 degrees. A figure near the lower border faces forward with his or her hands raised beside her head; the figure's mouth is open and his or her expression suggests fear or pain. A male to the right displays a wide-eyed expression suggesting surprise. A female with long hair appears in a twisted position in the lower right; both legs are bent and her arms are wrapped around her body. Two figures in the lower right are indistinct; only the head of the upper figure is visible.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The scene takes place in hell. A body of water, perhaps a lake, is visible in the lower half of the design. Two mountains rise above; an archway at the base of the leftmost mountain indicates a cave. Liquid, probably rain, seems to drip along the side of the mountain. Fire is visible on the upper portion of the mountain. Red and yellow coloring in the sky may suggest sunrise or sunset, or perhaps fire. Dark clouds or perhaps smoke appears in the upper right. A distant wall visible between the two mountain peaks may represent the city of Dis. A three-headed dog representing Cerberus appears in the mouth of a cave in the lower left portion of the design. The mouth of each head is open. The leftmost head faces left, the central head is turned up, and the rightmost head faces right. We can see the tongues of all three heads and perhaps teeth on the right head. A group of figures fly or hover in the upper right portion of the design; they are upside down and may be falling. Only the central figure is clearly visible; the figure is female and may be nude. Both legs are bent and her arms are raised at 135 degrees. Lightly sketched circles may suggest the heads of eight or more figures swimming in the lake in the lower portion of the design. Three additional figures may be swimming near the lower border with their arms raised at 135 degrees. Lightly sketched figures appear along the mountainside; two appear above the cave, three or four appear further to the right, and the heads of six figures are visible near the summit.  All the figures are probably gluttons.</illusobjdesc>

Two additional victims may be visible beneath Cerberus's other paws. Two gowned males appear on a stone ledge in the upper right portion of the design. The figure to the left is likely Virgil.

                    <illusobjdesc>The scene takes place in hell. An arch in the center of the design suggests a cave. Blue flames rise from the mouth of the cave. Green coloring in the lower right may indicate grass. Lightly sketched buildings at right border of the design may indicate the distant city of Dis. Flames rise from the city. A wall, path, or road leads downward from the buildings. Dark clouds or smoke appear in the sky in the upper portion of the design. Vertical lines throughout the design may indicate rain. A three-headed dog representing Cerberus lies below the mouth of a cave in the lower half of the design. The mouth of each head is open with the teeth and tongue visible. The leftmost head is turned up, the central head faces right, and the rightmost head faces forward. Cerberus holds three figures in its hand-like paws. Each figure's head is bent back and the mouth of the leftmost figure is open; his expression may indicate fear or pain. Two gowned males with long hair stand near the right border of the design. Both figures are seen from behind. The figure to the left is likely Virgil; both arms extend horizontally to the left and he offers handfuls of earth to Cerberus. The figure to the right is likely Dante. He stands with his left leg bent slightly and his left foot raised on tiptoe. Both arms are apparently bent up and to the right. His right palm is turned up and his left palm may be held vertically; the fingers of both hands are spread slightly. The heads of two lightly sketched figures appear in the lower left corner of the design. Their expressions suggest fear.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The scene is set in hell. A large stone ledge appears in the center of the design, possibly forming a cave below. Fire appears throughout the design and dark clouds or smoke rises above. Two gowned males with long hair stand on a stone ledge in the upper portion of the design. The figure to the left likely represents Dante. His right foot is raised on tiptoe and he may walk forward. Dante's right arm is down at his side and his right hand is not pictured. His left arm is raised at 45 degrees and he holds or touches Virgil's right arm. Virgil's right leg is bent with the right foot raised on tiptoe; he may walk forward. Virgil's right arm is bent slightly at his side. His left arm is bent and the palm of his left hand is turned out towards the viewer. The fingers of his left hand are spread. Virgil's eyes are apparently cast down and may look toward Plutus, below. Plutus is nude; his beard and long hair stand partially on end. His eyes are raised and he looks towards Dante and Virgil above. Plutus's mouth is open with the teeth visible; he may be speaking or shouting. He sits with both legs bent and drawn up; his right foot may be raised on tiptoe. The figure's right arm is raised horizontally and his right hand rests on a bag or jar of coins with the palm turned down. The word &quot;Money&quot; is inscribed just below the coins; see the Textual Transcription. His left arm is raised vertically and the palm of his left hand is turned out towards the viewer; his fingers are spread and he may point or otherwise gesture upward.</illusobjdesc>

Blue wash at the upper border suggests sky; a dark band of clouds forms a slight arch below. A female flies or hovers in the lower half of the design; she may represent the personification of Fortune. The figure is nude with her breasts exposed. Both arms are bent upward and her hands clutch at her head. Her lower body is twisted with the legs extended up and to the right and the feet together. Two groups of lightly sketched figures appear beneath the cloud belt in the upper portion of the design. Two circular objects, likely stone boulders, appear between the two groups. Both boulders are inscribed with texts, perhaps partly erased; see the Textual Transcription. Most of the figures are indistinct, suggested only by circular heads and rough pencil lines. The most defined figure stands to the left of the boulders with his or her right leg extended backward (to the left); he or she may walk or stride to the right. The figure bends or leans forward and likely pushes the leftmost boulder to the right. The figures on the right may be pushing the other stone.

He may be frowning and his expression suggests anger. Both legs are bent but only the figure's left foot is visible. His upper body is twisted to the right. The figure's right arm is bent upward and his left arm extends to the left across his body; both hands are held in fists. The figure second from the left has short hair. His mouth is open slightly and his expression suggests fear. His right arm is raised vertically and his right hand is raised in a fist. The figure third from the left has short hair. He faces right in profile and his mouth is open; he looks at his opponent to the right and his expression suggests anger. His right arm is bent upward and his right hand is raised in a fist. His left arm is raised at 135 degrees and his left hand clutches at the head of the figure to the right. The figure fourth from the left has long, curly hair. He faces left in profile and looks at his opponent to the left; his expression suggests anger. His right arm is apparently raised at 135 degrees and he clutches at the head of the figure to the left. The figure fifth from the left has short(?) hair and a beard. He faces left and may be frowning slightly. His left arm is raised above his head with the hand closed in a fist. The figure furthest right has long hair and a beard; he wears a cloth band on his forehead. His mouth is open with the teeth visible; his expression suggests fear or surprise. Both legs are apparently bent to the left and both feet are visible. The figure's left arm is bent upward and his right arm is raised vertically; both hands are held in fists above the figure's head. Three figures lie submerged at the bottom of the lake; they are upside down with their heads oriented down, towards the viewer.  They may have drowned. A nude(?) male with long hair and a beard appears furthest left. He faces up with his head turned to the left. Both legs are bent and drawn up with the knees prominent. The figure's left arm is bent and rests on the ground beside his head; his left hand is closed in a fist. A male(?) wearing a hood, helmet, or other head covering appears second from the left. His eyes are closed and his mouth is open slightly. The figure faces up with both legs bent to the right. A male with long hair and a beard appears furthest right. He may wear a gown, though his legs appear bare. Both legs are bent and drawn up with the knees prominent. The figure faces up with his upper body twisted to the right. His right arm rests at his side and his left arm is wrapped around his body.</illusobjdesc>

                <illustration location="E" type="plate">
                    <illusobjdesc>The scene is set in hell. A body of water representing &quot;the Stygian Lake&quot; extends across the lower half of the design; small waves are visible throughout. Distant mountains rise above. Clouds appear in the sky at the upper border of the design. A distant tower appears in the upper right portion of the design; the tower is dark and may be cast in shadow. The stern end of a sail boat appears on the water in the foreground; its rudder is visible to the right. Two gowned males with long hair stand in the boat. The figure to the left represents Dante. He is seen from behind with his head turned to the right; he looks down and to the right towards the figure rising from the water. Dante's arms are down at his sides. The palm of his right hand is turned down; his left hand is turned out, away from the viewer, with the fingers spread. The figure to the right represents Virgil. His legs are spread and he lunges to the right with his left leg bent forward. His head is turned down slightly and he looks at the figure below and to the right. Both arms are bent and Virgil holds the other figure's head and right arm, pushing him back from the boat. The nude figure likely represents Filippo Argenti. He faces forward with his mouth open and the upper row of teeth visible; he may be speaking or shouting. Filippo's expression suggests surprise. Both arms are raised vertically and the palms of both hands are turned out towards the viewer. The fingers of both hands are spread slightly. A gowned male with long hair and a beard sits or reclines in the rightmost section of the boat. He likely represents Phlegyas. Only his upper body is clearly visible. Phlegyas's right arm is bent and rests at his side. His left arm is bent back slightly and his left hand holds or rests on the tiller with the palm turned down.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The scene is set in hell. A body of water representing the Styx appears lower left; waves are visible throughout. A series of arches above the lake suggest other distant circles of hell. Five lightly sketched figures stand within the arch in the upper right portion of the design. At least one additional figure appears in the arch in the upper left. Dark vertical lines throughout the design may indicate rain. The outer wall of the city of Dis stands on the shore of the Styx in the lower right portion of the design. A closed(?) gate appears in the center of the wall; a step is visible below the threshold. There are slight suggestions of a portcullis in the upper part of this portal. The roof of a building is visible above the wall. Fire rises above the wall. A path or road leads from the shore of the Styx to the gate. Two lightly sketched gowned figures stand at the gate of the city of Dis; they likely represent Dante and Virgil. A whirlwind appears above the Styx, extending from the left border and rising above the city of Dis. The whirlwind forms one or two loops. A multitude of figures are visible within the whirlwind; additional figures appear in the Styx, below. Only the figures' heads are clearly visible. A nude male(?) with long hair lies on the shore of the Styx just below the whirlwind. The figure is positioned upside down with his head oriented down towards the viewer. Both legs are bent and drawn up. His arms extend horizontally, in a cruciform position, and hie hands rest on the ground with the palms turned down. A nude male angel with long hair appears in the lower left corner of the design. The angel runs or strides to the right in a contracted position; both legs are bent and spread wide apart and his left knee is drawn up to his chest. Both arms are bent and the figure's left hand is raised in front of his face.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The scene is set in hell. The outer wall of the city of Dis extends across the center of the design. An entryway in the center of the wall is blocked by a portcullis. An angel stands on a step below the gate. A path or road at the lower border of the design leads to the step below the wall. Fire rises above the wall; grey wash in the upper left and right corners may suggest smoke. Grass appears at the lower border of the design, to the left and right of the pathway. A spiky or thorny vine grows in the lower left corner and a leafy vine rises along the wall in the lower right. Two flowers, possibly sunflowers, with distinct petals appear in the lower right; their stems arch to the left. Two budding stems arch to the right. A nude male angel with long hair stands in the center of the design. He is seen from behind with his wings are outstretched and his buttocks prominent. The figure's right leg extends backward with the right foot raised on tiptoe. His left leg is bent slightly and he climbs onto the step below the wall. The angel's right arm is raised at 45 degrees and he holds a staff or walking stick in his right hand. His left arm is raised at 135 degrees; the palm of his left hand is turned out, away from the viewer, with the fingers spread. Three female figures representing the Furies fly or hover at the upper border of the design. Only the figures' heads and arms are pictured. Their mouths are open and they may be speaking or screaming. The figure furthest left has long hair and her head is turned up and to the right. Her right arm is raised horizontally and she holds a musical horn in her right hand; flames emerge from the bell of the horn. The figure furthest right mirrors this pose; she holds a flaming horn in her raised left hand. The central figure has curly hair, possibly representing the serpent-hair of a gorgon. Her head is turned down with the eyes cast down; she looks at the angel below. Both arms are raised at 135 degrees and she holds a snake or serpent in each hand. The serpents' mouths are open with the tongues extended; the serpent to the left may have a crested head. Two gowned males with long hair stand in the lower left portion of the design. The figure to the right represents Virgil. Virgil faces forward with his head turned up and to the right; he looks towards the angel and furies above. His left arm is bent an he touches or embraces Dante, covering his eyes. Dante faces left with his head turned down. His left arm is bent upward and he holds his gown to his face. His legs are spread and his left foot is raised on tiptoe; he may walk or stride to the left.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The scene is set in hell. A wall extends across the center of the design and the roofs of several buildings are visible above, representing the city of Dis. A building with a domed roof has four visible pillars or columns. Fire rises among the buildings; a dark shape above the right portion of the wall may represent smoke. Dark clouds appear in the sky. Three graves or tombs appear at the lower border of the design. The tomb lids are propped open and flames rise from each of the graves. Virgil stands at the left border of the design. He is gowned and has long hair. Both arms are down at his sides. Virgil faces forward with his head turned slightly to the right; he looks to the right towards Dante. Dante is gowned and has long hair. Both feet are visible below his gown. His right arm is down at his side and his left arm is bent upward; the palm of his left hand is turned out towards the viewer. Dante faces right in profile with his head turned down slightly; he looks towards the figures in the tomb below. A male figure representing Farinata degli Uberti appears within a grave at the lower border of the design. Only his upper body is clearly visible. He is gowned and has a long beard. He wears a helmet, suggesting that he is a soldier. Farinata's right arm is bent upward; the fingers of his right hand are spread and he may point or otherwise gesture upward. His left arm is down at his side and the fingers of his left hand touch the ground below. The head and shoulders of a male figure appear above the edge of a grave in the lower right portion of the design; he likely represents Cavalcante Cavalcanti. The figure has long hair and a beard. He faces forward with his head turned up and to the left; he looks towards Dante. The figure's hands rest on the ground at the edge of the grave with the fingers spread.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The scene is set in hell. Large stones appear at the lower border of the design. A cliff drops off steeply in the lower left. Green coloring in the lower right portion of the design indicates grass. Two gowned males with long hair stand at the edge of the cliff. The figure to the left represents Dante. He faces left with his upper body turned away from the viewer and his head turned up and to the right; he looks toward Virgil above. Dante's legs are bent and his left foot is raised on tiptoe; he likely runs to the left, fleeing from the minotaur. Both arms are bent upward and the palm of his left hand is held vertically. Virgil faces right in profile and looks towards the minotaur. His left arm is raised horizontally with the palm of his left hand held vertically. Virgil's right arm is raised at 45 degrees and he holds hands with Dante. A minotaur stands in the right half of the design. The figure's head and body are covered in fur and his upper body is bare. He faces left with his upper body twisted forward. Two horns rise from the figure's temples and his mouth is open slightly with the teeth visible. The minotaur rears up on his hind legs with the front legs extended up and to the left. His tail rises upward to the right. Both arms are bent upward and the palms of both hands are turned up. A distant wall is visible in the right half of the design; fire rises above. The wall may represent the city of Dis. A building or altar appears in the center of the design. A faint inscription, &quot;MIASTAMU,&quot; is visible on the upper portion of the altar. Blue wash at the left border indicates sky. Two dark clouds or smoke rise to the right; grey wash throughout the sky suggests additional clouds or smoke.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The scene takes place in hell. A river of blood identified in the poem as the Phlegethon flows through a valley in the central portion of the design. A distant hill or mountain may rise above. Green coloring on the banks of the river suggests grass or other vegetation. Two lightly defined cliffs frame the scene, rising along the left and right borders of the design. A male centaur stands at the left border of the design. The figure's upper body is nude and he has long hair. He is seen from behind with his head turned to the left in profile. The figure's right arm is bent and he holds a bow in his right hand. A female centaur with long hair sits at the right border of the design. She faces left with her head turned to the right. Her front leg bent forward; she may be crouching. Her upper body is nude with her breasts exposed. Her left arm is bent at her side. Four centaurs stand on the left bank of the river in the lower portion of the design. The figure furthest left may be female; she is lightly drawn, but may have exposed breasts. Only her upper body is clearly visible. The figure's right arm is bent upward and wraps around her head. The figure second from the left is male and has long hair. He faces right and his right arm is raised at 45 degrees; he holds a bow in his right hand. The figure third from the left faces forward and slightly right. His or her features are indistinct. The figure's left arm is raised at 45 degrees and he or she holds a bow. The figure furthest right is likely male. He stands facing right with his front right leg bent backward. His left arm is raised horizontally and he holds a bow in his left hand. His right arm is bent and he draws back an arrow on the bowstring. He may look toward the figure fleeing to the right. The fleeing figure is nude and may fly or hover above the river in the lower right portion of the design. The figure is seen from behind with his or her buttocks prominent. The figure's right arm is raised at 135 degrees. The figure's right leg is bent and his or her left leg extends backward; he or she may run to the right. At least sixteen lightly sketched figures appear partially submerged within the Phlegethon; the figures are likely standing at various depths. The heads of eight figures appear above the surface of the river in the lower portion of the design. The upper bodies of at least eight figures are visible along the length of the river, appearing singly or in small groups of two and three. One figure in the lower right raises his or her arms horizontally.  Some of these figures may be swimming. Four lightly sketched centaurs stand on the upper right bank of the river; one of the centaurs runs or leaps to the left with his or her forelegs raised above the ground.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The scene takes place in hell. Six thorny trees appear in the foreground of the design; at least four of the trees are clearly anthropomorphic with human faces and bodies visible along their trunks.  These are self-violators transformed into trees. Distant leafy trees appear across the center of the design. White space in the upper half of the design indicates sky; red and yellow coloring at the left border suggests fire. Two gowned males with long hair stand in the center of the design; the figure to the left represents Dante. He stands with his legs spread apart and both feet visible; he may be crouching slightly. Both arms are raised at 45 degrees and extend to the left with the palms turned down. Dante looks at the bleeding branch to the right. The broken section of the branch (with oak leaves?) lies on the ground below Dante's feet. The figure to the right represents Virgil. He faces forward with his left arm down at his side. A male spirit appears in the tree fourth from the left; he represents Pier delle Vigne. Vigne has a beard and his long hair stands on end, rising among the branches of the tree. His head is turned up and slightly left; he looks at his bleeding branch or perhaps the harpy perched above. A female spirit appears upside down in the tree second from the left. She is nude with her breasts exposed. Her long hair falls among the roots of the tree and her mouth may be open. The upper body of a female spirit appears in the tree third from the left. She is nude with her breasts exposed. The head of an indistinct spirit is visible in the tree furthest right. Three harpies sit perched on the upper branches of the anthropomorphized trees; they have the bodies of birds with female faces and breasts. The figures have long hair and beak-like noses. The central figure's wings are spread and her head is turned up; she wears a necklace or other cord tied around her neck.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>The scene is set in hell. Yellow wash in the center of the design suggests grass. The trunks of four trees are visible in the foreground at the left and right borders of the design. The trunks divide into several leafy branches and a leafy vine or other vegetation appears on the trees to the left. Additional trees appear across the design in the distance. White space in the upper half of the design suggests a cloud-filled sky. A nude male with short hair kneels in the lower left corner of the design; he likely represents Giacomo da Sant' Andrea. He is seen from behind and faces left with his head turned over his left shoulder. His expression suggests fear. Giacomo's right leg extends backward and he likely crawls or flees from the dogs pictured to the right. Both arms are bent upward and Giacomo grasps or touches the trunk of a tree. A nude male with long hair stands in the left portion of the design; he likely represents Lano da Siena. The figure's genitals are clearly visible. His right leg is bent with the right foot raised on tiptoe. He leans or bends to the right and he may flee from the dogs pictured below. Lano's right arm is bent upward and wraps around his head; the palm of his right hand is turned down. His left arm is raised horizontally with his left palm held vertically. Lano's eyes are cast down and he looks at the dogs; his expression suggests fear. Three dogs with spiky fur appear in the lower half of the design. The dogs run to the left, pursuing the fleeing figures. The dog furthest left bites the right buttock of Giacomo da Sant' Andrea. The other dogs' mouths are open with their teeth and tongues visible. Two harpies perch in the trees in the upper corners of the design; they have the bodies of birds with female faces and breasts. The figures have long hair and beak-like noses. Their wings are folded at the sides and their talons clutch the tree branches. They may be smiling. The harpy to the left tilts her head down slightly; her eyes are cast down and she looks at the figures below.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The scene is set in hell. Fire appears throughout the design, raining down from a dark cloud at the upper border. Two gowned males with long hair stand at the right border of the design. The figure to the left represents Dante. He faces forward with his head turned to the left. Dante's left arm is down at his side with the palm of his left hand turned down. His right arm is bent upward with the palm of his right hand turned up slightly. The figure to the right represents Virgil. He faces left in profile and is largely obscured by Dante. Four nude figures stand among flames in the right half of the design; they represent the sodomites. The figure furthest left is female and has long hair. Her left leg is bent with the left foot raised on tiptoe. Her right leg extends to the left and she runs to the right; she is likely fleeing from the fiery rain. Her right arm is bent upwards and her left arm is raised vertically. The palms of both hands are turned upward. Her mouth is open and her expression suggests fear. Only the buttocks and legs of the figure second from the left are visible; the figure strides to the right and his or her left foot is raised on tiptoe. A male with short, curly hair appears third from the left. He faces forward and his genitals are covered by flames. The figure's right leg is bent and his left foot is raised on tiptoe. Both arms are bent upward; his left palm is turned up and his right palm is held vertically. The figure's mouth is open and his expression suggests fear or pain. The figure furthest right is seen from behind with the buttocks prominent. The figure strides to the right with his or her right leg bent and the left foot raised on tiptoe. Four gowned figures sit among flames in the lower left portion of the design; they represent the usurers. At least two of the figures sit with their legs bent and drawn up. The figure third from the left sits with his or her legs crossed at the ankles. Both arms are bent upward and his or her hands are held together in prayer or supplication. The figure furthest right bends his or her left arm upward with the palm held vertically. At least two of the figures mouths are open; their expressions suggest fear or despair. At least four figures lie among flames in the lower left corner of the design; they represent the blasphemers. The nude figure in the foreground lies prone with his or her body extended horizontally across the design. Above, a figure raises his or her head slightly. Two other figures lie supine to the right; both figures are lightly sketched with only their upper bodies clearly visible. There may be the face of a fifth figure in the flames far left.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>The scene is set in hell. A nude male, perhaps a king, stands in the center of the design; he represents the personification of human history as described in canto 14 of the &quot;Inferno.&quot; The figure has long, curly hair and he wears a spiked crown. Yellow coloring on the figure's head suggests gold. A halo of rose wash appears around his head. Tears flow from the figure's eyes and his expression suggests grief or despair. Water flows down the figures body and divides to the left and right by his feet; the poem indicates that this is the source of the rivers of Hell. The figure is partly nude; his groin is covered with scales, and he apparently wears armor on his forearms and shins. Red coloring on his right foot and shin suggests clay. The figure's left arm is bent and he holds a lightly sketched scepter decorated with a fleur-de-lis. His right arm is down at his side and he holds an orb decorated with a cross. A mountain representing Mt. Ida rises in the center of the design. Two lightly sketched figures recline on the mountain in the upper portion of the design. The figure to the right, possibly female, has long hair. The figure to the left, probably male, may have a beard; he apparently holds a dagger or sword. Two leafy trees appear to the left and right of the central figure. The trunks each divide into two distinct branches. Light green coloring below the tree on the left may indicate grass.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The scene takes place in hell. Two gowned figures with long hair stand on a grassy hill or mound near the left border. The figure to the left represents Virgil; he is seen from behind and faces away from the viewer with his head turned to the right. The figure to the right represents Dante; he faces right with his head turned down slightly. A single tear is visible below Dante's right eye and he may be frowning. He looks towards the figures to the right and his expression suggests grief. Three nude male figures fly or hover within a whirlwind of fire and smoke. They likely represent Jacopo Rusticucci, Guido Guerra, and Tegghiaio Aldobrandi. The figure in the lower left is seen from behind and twists away from the viewer. His head is turned up and to the left, and he looks towards Dante; his mouth is open and he may be speaking. Both legs are bent and the figure's left buttock is prominent.

                    <illusobjdesc>The scene takes place in hell. A mountain is visible in the upper right corner; two small hills appear in the lower left. Fire rises along the lower border of the design. Blue wash in the upper half represents sky; white clouds appear in the upper left, and dark clouds or smoke rise above the mountain in the upper right. The monster Geryon flies or hovers in the center of the design. The figure has the head and chest of a human male, with the body of a serpent, a scorpion-like stinger, and two lion-like claws. The figure has long hair. Scales are visible along the length of Geryon's body, and his tail forms a single loop. Two gowned males with long hair appear on Geryon's left shoulder; they represent Virgil and Dante. The figure to the left sits with his right leg bent and his right hand resting on his knee. The coloring of his gown indicates that this is Dante. His left arm is apparently bent and he may hold hands with the figure to the right. The figure to the right kneels and faces left in profile. The coloring of his gown indicates that this is Virgil. His right arm is down and he braces against Geryon's shoulder with the palm turned down. At least three figures run or stride to the left along the hills in the lower left portion of the design; they may be fleeing Geryon or perhaps flee from the fire. One figure is female; her torso twists forward with breasts clearly visible. As many as four additional, lightly sketched figures may appear further left.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The scene takes place in hell. A broken wall or other stone structure stands in the lower left portion. A chain connects to a wheel(?) or toothed gear to the left of the wall. A steep cliff rises above. A body of water, perhaps a fiery lake or river, is visible in the lower right. Two arches, perhaps the circles of hell, rise above the water. Blue, purple, and yellow coloring represents sky. Two gowned males with long hair stand in the lower left portion of the design; they represent Dante and Virgil. Both figures' arms are bent with the palms apparently held vertically. The figure to the left (Dante) faces right, while the figure to the right (Virgil) faces forward. A male figure lies supine in the lower left portion of the design; his body extends horizontally with his head to the right. He wears a helmet and may represent a soldier. The figure's eyes are closed and he may be dead. His left arm is at his side with the hand resting on the ground; there may be a shackle on the figure's wrist. A demon crouches over the corpse of a soldier in the lower portion of the design. The demon has bat-like wings and its right leg is bent at extreme angles.  Some of its characteristics, such as the right leg, suggest an insect such as a grasshopper. Its head is down against the soldier's throat. Seven nude figures appear along the cliff in the upper left down to the shore in the lower right; the figures likely represent the seducers. They flee from the demons flying above. Three horned male demons with bat-like wings fly in the right half of the design. Two of the demons have serpent-like tails, and all three hold whips or switches. The central demon holds the wrist of one of the seducers below. Two groups of lightly sketched figures appear on the arched structures in the upper portion of the design. As many as seven figures, perhaps seducers, stand on the leftmost arch; they may run or flee to the left. A figure, likely a demon, flies or hovers above; the figure's right arm is raised horizontally and he or she holds a whip. The figure(s) on the rightmost arch, perhaps seducers, may lay or crawl on the ground. Two demons with serpent-like tails fly or hover above; each holds a handle of a whip or stick in his or her right hand.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The scene takes place in hell. A dark river or lake of excrement appears at the lower border. Two hills or mountains rise above. The sky at the upper border is a dark purple in the upper left and a light rose in the upper right. A dark cloud extends across the center of the design; fire rains down from the left portion of the cloud. Two gowned males with long hair kneel or crouch on a hill in the upper right corner of the design; they represent Virgil and Dante. Both figures hold the fabric of their gowns up to cover their noses. Dante (right) and Virgil (left) both look towards the figures below with their eyes cast down. The figure to the left gestures downward with the palm of his left hand turned out towards the viewer and the fingers slightly spread. The figure to the right rests his right hand on his knee. This right leg is bent and drawn up with the right foot visible. The upper body of a male figure rises above the river or lake of excrement in the lower left portion of the design. He likely represents Alessio Interminei, one of the flatterers. Alessio's hair is curly. His eyes are raised and he looks towards Dante and Virgil, above. His mouth is open with the upper row of teeth visible and he may be speaking. Both arms are bent upward and his hands clutch at his head. A nude female with long hair begins to crouch, bending left and forward, in the river or lake of excrement in the lower right portion of the design; only her feet are submerged, and her left foot is apparently raised on tiptoe. The figure likely represents Thas, one of the flatterers. She wears a crown or wreath of beads in her long hair. The figure faces forward with her breasts exposed. Her head is turned up and her eyes are raised; she looks towards Dante and Virgil above. Thas' right arm is raised at 45 degrees. Her left arm is bent upward with the palm of her left hand turned up. The heads of five figures appear in the river or lake of excrement in the lower half of the design; the figures are likely male and they represent the flatterers. Four figures to the left of Alessio Interminei have short, curly hair. Flames appear above two of the figures' heads; one figure's mouth is open and his expression suggests fear or pain. Another figure's head is turned up and to the left in profile; his mouth is slightly open and his eyes may be closed. A figure to the right of Alessio has long hair and a beard. The arms of a sixth figure rise vertically above the river of lake; the palms are turned out towards the viewer with the fingers spread. A nude figure, possibly female, with long hair flies, hovers, or perhaps runs along a hill in the upper left portion of the design. The figure's right leg is bent and drawn up; his or her left leg extends backward. The figure's left arm is raised at 135 degrees and the fingers of the figure's left hand are spread. The right arm is bent and wraps around the figure's head with his or her right palm held vertically. The figure faces left with his or her head turned to the right; the figure's mouth is open and his or her expression suggests fear. The figure may represent a seducer from the previous design, fleeing from the demon to the right. A nude female, likely a demon, flies or hovers in the upper portion of the design; she pursues the figure fleeing to the left. The demon has long, curly hair, and has two coiled horns rising from her forehead. Her head is upside down. She is seen from behind with her buttocks prominent. The figure's body is positioned horizontally and her upper body is twisted slightly; her right breast is visible. Both legs are bent and the soles of her feet are turned out towards the viewer. Her right arm is bent and she holds the handle of a whip in her right hand.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The scene takes place in the Eighth Circle of Hell, where the simoniac popes are inserted one after another into a well of fire. The well appears in the lower half of the design, with tongues of flame rising from its opening. The well is at least partly transparent. Pope Nicholas III appears upside down within the well.  He is nude.  Seen from behind, he faces away but bends to the left at the waist and turns his head to look up.  His mouth is open as if he is speaking.  Both of his arms are bent out from his body, with palms facing out and fingers spread.  His legs extend from the top of the well.  Both legs are bent and the soles of his feet face out toward the viewer.  Tongues of flame leap from inside the well and from his feet.  He has short hair.  Virgil kneels at or strides through the mouth of a cave in the upper portion of the design. His left leg is bent forward and his bent right leg is extended backward, with the right foot resting on tiptoe. He is gowned and has long hair. Virgil embraces or holds Dante, bending and leaning forward and to the right with his head turned down slightly. Virgil's arms are down and bent around the torso of Dante. Virgil's mouth is slightly open. Dante is seen from behind and faces away from the viewer with his head bent back and turned to the right. Dante is gowned and his hair is long and curly. His mouth is slightly open. Dante's lower body is not clearly pictured. His right arm may be raised and wrapped around Virgil's head. The pair approaches the well through the mouth of a cave. Its craggy walls fill much of the left and right sides of the design.  Light and shadow seem to flicker on these rocky surfaces, as if from the flames in the well.  Clouds (or cloud-like rocks) appear below the well, adding to the unearthly appearance of the scene.  Flames and perhaps clouds of smoke appear in the distance to either side of Dante and Virgil.  Vaguely defined shapes on either side also suggest distant rocky outcroppings or distant hills.  There may be some vegetation on the side of the cave right of Virgil's head.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The scene takes place in Hell. A cloud billows behind the figures of the four necromancers, beneath a rocky bridge.  Wash beyond the cloud below the bridge, as well as surrounding Dante and Virgil at the top of the design, suggests the sky at sunrise or sunset.  The four figures at the bottom of the design walk in single file across bare earth or floor.  These represent the Necromancers and Augurs punished in the fourth trench of the Eighth Circle.  Their lower bodies face away and to the left, but their heads have been turned to face forward and to the right.  The figures step carefully backwards, to the right.  The leftmost figure is a man who raises his arms up to the left at 135 degrees, palms out.  He steps backwards with his bent right leg; his bent left leg is slightly forward of his body.  He is bald but bearded.  His mouth is open and his eyes are raised.  The female figure second to left is Manto, stepping behind her with her bent left leg on tiptoe.  Her left arm is down and bent across her chest, while her bent right arm is raised at not quite 135 degrees.  The palms of both open hands face out.  Manto has long, curly hair and wears a small beribboned hat.  Her mouth may be slightly open.  She bends backward at the waist.  Third from left walks a male figure bending forward slightly with his left arm down by his side, palm down.  His right arm is raised vertically and bent, with palm out.  His thick long hair and full beard cover much of his upper body.  His right foot, clad in a sandal, is visible beneath the hem of his gown.  The fourth figure bends backward slightly and tilts his head down.  He has long hair and a long beard.  All three males seem to be old.  Above them, a rock bridge arches across the top of the design.  Dante and Virgil, depicted roughly in pencil sketches, sit together on the bridge.  On the left, Virgil seems to lean to the left with his bent right elbow braced on an outcropping of the bridge.  His bent legs seem to be drawn up to the right, and he rests his bent left arm on his knees.  Though he faces forward and leans left, he turns and bends his head to the right, towards Dante.  Dante sits or kneels facing forward and left, with his bent right leg drawn up and his left seemingly extended down to the right.  His left arm is down between his legs, and his left hand rests on the rock bridge.  His right arm is bent up and supported partially by his right leg.  He props his chin on his right hand, which may in turn rest on his right knee.  Both figures have long hair and seem to be clad in robes. </illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>Four figures wearing transparent or partly transparent gowns walk in single file across the lower border of the design.  These represent the Necromancers and Augurs punished in the fourth trench of the Eighth Circle.  Their lower bodies face away and to the left, but their heads have been turned to face forward and to the right.  The figures step carefully backwards, to the right.  The leftmost figure is a man who raises his arms up to the left at 135 degrees, palms out.  He steps backwards with his bent right leg; his bent left leg is slightly forward of his body.  He is bald but bearded.  His mouth is open and his eyes are raised.  The female figure second to left is Manto, stepping behind her with her bent left leg on tiptoe.  Her left arm is down and bent across her chest, while her bent right arm is raised at not quite 135 degrees.  The palms of both open hands face out.  Manto has long, curly hair and wears a small beribboned hat.  Her mouth may be slightly open.  She bends backward at the waist.  Third from left walks a male figure bending forward slightly with his left arm down by his side, palm down.  His right arm is raised vertically and bent, with palm out.  His thick long hair and full beard cover much of his upper body.  His right foot, clad in a sandal, is visible beneath the hem of his gown.  The fourth figure bends backward slightly and tilts his head down.  He has long hair and a long beard.  All three males seem to be old.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The scene takes place in hell. A boiling pool of pitch stretches across the bottom of the design.  Rocky ledges of varying heights form the bank of the pitch pool.  A demon crouches on the highest ledge near the top of the design, holding a sinner on his shoulders.  Facing forward and slightly left, the demon's bent right leg is drawn forward, his bent left leg extended backward.  His head is down.  Both feet seem to be on tiptoe, and his toes also suggest claws.  He bends forward sharply at the waist beneath the weight of the figure on his shoulders, who represents a peculator (embezzler) from Lucca.  The demon's bat-like wings are spread wide on either side of his body, and he lifts his bent arms overhead to grasp the sinner with both hands.  The muscular demon is nude with visible genitals, and has short curly hair.  The peculator on his back kneels facing right, bent forward at the waist so that his torso rests on his thighs in a contracted posture.  His head is down.  He is sketchily drawn in pencil, with only a few lines inked, but he seems to hold his right arm along his lap.  He may be nude, and he has short curly hair.  Dante and Virgil stand side-by-side near the left side of the design, on a slightly lower ledge.  They face forward.  Sketched lightly in pencil, with a few inked lines, the figures' identities are difficult to distinguish.  The one on the right stands slightly forward of the other, with his weight resting on his left leg and his right leg slightly bent.  His left arm is bent across his torso and his right seems to be down by his side, though it may be bent upward at the elbow.  The figure on the left has his right arm by his side.  His left leg may be bent forward slightly.  Both figures turn their heads slightly to the right.  They have long hair and wear gowns.  Two additional demons sit on a low ledge near the lower right corner.  The demon on the right faces forward with his bent right leg drawn up and his bent left leg down.  His right arm is down and bent across his chest at the elbow; his right finger is raised in a pointing gesture.  He leans down to the left and may prop his right elbow against the demon to the left.  His right hand may also rest on his right knee.  His left arm is visible only at the shoulder.  He bends his head back sharply, smiling slightly, and looks up to the left at the demon above who casts the peculator back into the pool.  Only the upper body and perhaps the knees of the demon on the left are visible beyond the demon on the right.  This leftmost demon faces forward but turns his head to the right.  His right arm is raised and bent up at the elbow, and he grasps a large spear or spike with a hook in this hand.  His bent knees may be visible to the left of the elbow of the demon on the right.  Both demons are nude and have short curly hair.  The points of their folded bat-like wings rise above their heads.  Tusks grow from the face of the demon on the left, who turns his head slightly right.  The genitals of the one on the right are visible.  Blake has sketched in pencil additional raised hooks above the demons' wings.  Wash surrounding the figures in the upper half of the design suggests the sky, perhaps at sunrise or sunset.

                <illustration location="E" type="plate">
                    <illusobjdesc>The scene takes place in hell. The lake of boiling pitch from the previous design extends across the bottom of the design.  Near its far shore, just below the left side of the bridge in the distance, tongues of fire burn on the tar.  The near bank, along the bottom of the design, is bare earth. The far bank, visible only at the left edge of the design, seems similarly bare. A wavering line above the heads of Dante and Virgil on the left and the leftmost seducers suggest a higher ledge or crag.  Wash in the upper two-thirds of the design suggests the sky, perhaps at sunrise or sunset. On the horizon beneath the far bridge appear faintly delineated shapes that may be the heads and shoulders of sinners punished by insertion in the lake.  Jagged lines above their heads suggest steam or smoke.  The peculator (embezzler) from the previous design appears immersed in the lake of boiling pitch.  He is visible from the shoulders up, facing left.  His left arm reaches out horizontally near the surface of the tar.  He bends his head back and turns it forward, his eyes raised and his mouth open in pain.  His right arm is raised vertically and bent over his head.  A group of demons standing on the near shore of the lake, in the lower right corner of the design, harass the peculator.  The leftmost demon faces away, but turns his head left.  He strides or lunges with his left leg extended back and to the left, and his right leg bent forward to the right.  His left foot is on tiptoe; it casts a small shadow on the ground below.  He holds his arms out horizontally and bends forward towards the peculator on the left.  With his left hand he holds the haft of a hook that he uses to prod the peculator in the lake.  His right hand may hold the buttocks of the demon to the right.  His spiky, bat-like wings are spread wide.  The three demons to the right are sketched in pencil standing shoulder-to-shoulder.  The leftmost of the three may be female.  She faces away and twists her head and torso slightly to the right.  She stands with her right leg bent across in front of her left, her right foot on tiptoe.  Her wings are folded backwards.  Her hair may be short and curly, or may be drawn up into a bun.  The middle demon rests his weight largely on his right leg and crosses his bent left leg over the right, with left foot on tiptoe.  His left arm is draped over the shoulders of the rightmost demon.  He turns his head partly to the left and seems to hold his mouth open and his eyes raised.  He has short curly hair.  The spikes of his bat-like wings appear over his head.  The rightmost demon also faces forward, but turns his head to look left.  His mouth may be open.  He stands with right leg straight and left leg bent forward slightly.  His left arm is bent upward at the elbow and he grasps the haft of a hook with this hand.  He has short curly hair as well.  Fainter pencil lines above his head suggest his wings.  All three standing demons are nude, though a sort of breechcloth of scales covers the rightmost demon's genitals.



                        A stone bridge arches up from the lower left foreground and crosses the top of the design to descend along the right ledge.  Within the bridge or arch, large human shapes are visible, including a face with long hair and beard, an ear, two feet, and perhaps a muscled abdomen or breasts.  The lightly penciled shape of a small, seated female figure above the ear may represent a petrified spirit.  This figure faces forward and is mainly visible as a head and upper body, with the faint suggestion of bent legs to the left.



                        A second stone bridge or arch is visible in the distance, through the arch in the foreground.  Blake has lightly sketched several groups of human figures running across this distant bridge.  They are probably the seducers.  Near the left side of the bridge, two figures run together.  The figure on the right, higher on the bridge, faces forward with arms spread roughly horizontally.  This figure's left leg is bent forward; its right leg is extended backward.  It seems to turn its head back to look at the figure behind.  This second figure is less clearly defined, but seems to face right and step forward with one leg and extend the other leg backwards.  Near the top of the arch a second group of figures runs facing right.  One crawls along the ground on hands and knees, with its body horizontal.  Its left leg is drawn up and its right leg is extended backwards.  To the right of the crawling figure, another leaps with right leg extended backwards and left leg bent and drawn up.  This figure leans forward sharply and curls its right arm up around its head.  Two more figures appear on the bridge to the right of the leaping figure.  Both of these figures run facing right with one leg forward and one leg extended backwards.  They lean forward.  The one on the left may raise its arms.  Just to the right of these figures, additional sketched lines may represent additional figures, or perhaps shadows.  Three demons fly above these tiny figures, chasing them.  The demons are sketched lightly in pencil and their shapes are indistinct, but they seem to fly shoulder to shoulder facing forward with their heads bent back and their bodies stretched horizontally to the left.  They each raise one or both bent arms overhead, brandishing large whips.  Dante and Virgil stand side by side on the distant bank of the pitch lake, next to the design's left edge.  They seem to face forward and to wear long gowns. Their figures, sketched faintly in pencil, are otherwise difficult to discern.

                        <illusobjdesc>A stone bridge arches up from the lower left foreground and crosses the top of the design to descend along the right edge.  Within the bridge or arch, large human shapes are visible.  A large face forms part of the base of the left side of the arch.  It looks forward, and has long hair, a beard, and lowered eyes.  Its hair may extend past the base of the arch along the ground at the left.  A right foot with claw-like toes protrudes from the base of the arch below and to the right of the face.  To the left of the face, a vaguely defined shape suggests a knee and lower leg.  Lines above the face hint at breasts or a muscled abdomen.  An ear appears above.  Lines to left and right of the ear suggest curly hair.  Above and to the right of the ear, a right foot with toes and clearly defined toenails is visible.  The lightly penciled shape of a small, seated female figure above the ear may represent a petrified spirit.  This figure faces forward and is mainly visible as a head and upper body, with the faint suggestion of bent legs to the left. Sketchily drawn lines on either side of the foot to the right suggest hair (on the left) and a nose and open mouth (on the right).  Other lightly sketched lines along the top and especially the right side of the arch indicate additional undefined human shapes.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>Blake has lightly sketched several groups of human figures running across the distant bridge.  They are probably the seducers.  Near the left side of the bridge, two figures run together.  The figure on the right, higher on the bridge, faces forward with arms spread roughly horizontally.  This figure's right hand may be touching the figure behind, or helping that figure climb up the bridge.  This figure's left leg is bent forward; its right leg is extended backward.  It seems to turn its head back to look at the figure behind.  This second figure is less clearly defined, but seems to face right and step forward with one leg and extend the other leg backwards.  Near the top of the arch a second group of figures runs facing right.  One crawls along the ground on hands and knees, with its body horizontal.  Its left leg is drawn up and its right leg is extended backwards.  To the right of the crawling figure, another leaps with right leg extended backwards and left leg bent and drawn up.  This figure leans forward sharply and curls its right arm up around its head.  Two more figures appear on the bridge to the right of the leaping figure.  Both of these figures run facing right with one leg forward and one leg extended backwards.  They lean forward.  The one on the left may raise its arms.  Just to the right of these figures, additional sketched lines may represent additional figures, or perhaps shadows.</illusobjdesc>

Wash in the upper two-thirds of the design suggests the sky, perhaps at sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The scene takes place in hell. The lake of boiling pitch from the previous designs appears in the lower half of the design.  Two large rocks or boulders rest to the right of the lake.  Additional rocks form the bank of the lake at the left. Dark wash in the upper left corner of the design suggests a dark sky. Malacoda's muscular figure fills much of the middle of this design.  The devil sits facing forward and turning his head slightly to the right to look at Virgil.  His mouth is slightly open and horns curl up from his forehead.  His right leg is bent and his knee is drawn up; his bent left leg is down.  Both feet may rest on tiptoe.  His left arm is extended down by his side, and his left hand may rest on his left knee.  He raises his right arm vertically overhead, with his palm facing out.  He is nude, but his genitals are concealed behind scales between his legs.  He has large bat-like wings.  His abandoned hook rests at his feet.  Virgil stands to the right of the devil, facing left and raising his left arm vertically overhead.  He points upward with his left index finger.  His right forearm is visible in front of his torso, bent up at the elbow.  He may be making a fist with this hand, or may raise one finger.  His right leg is extended backwards and this foot seems to be on tiptoe.  Virgil's clothing is difficult to discern but he seems to wear a long gown and to have long hair.  Two additional devils stand behind Virgil at the right edge of the design, facing left.  The foremost devil, which is also the one most clearly defined in Blake's penciled lines, stands with left foot slightly forward.  His left arm, by his side, is bent up at the elbow and his left hand is at his chin.  His head is bent slightly.  He holds a tall hook propped in the crook of his left wrist; its haft extends nearly to the ground below.  He has short curly hair, a protruding belly, and bat-like wings.  To the right, above the first devil's wings, the head of a second devil faces left and slightly forward.  He has short curly hair also.  His legs, below, face left.  Sketched lines above this devil's head may indicate wings or weapons.  Both devils seem to be nude.  Dante huddles at the left side of the enormous boulder at the center of the design, where he is hidden from view of the devils.  He presses his upper body against the rock, facing forward but with eyes swiveled right towards the devils and Virgil.  His right arm is bent up at the elbow in front of his chest; his right hand is at his chin and he may be resting his head on this hand.  His lower body is difficult to discern but seems to extend to the left above another rock.  He seems to be wearing a long gown.  He may have long hair, or may have a scarf or similar piece of clothing wrapped around his head like a hood.  He may help to cast the largest of the shadows that fall in the crevices between the rocks below.

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place in the eighth circle of hell. The demon Barbariccia walks to the right, but twists his body forward and turns his head to the left; he looks left at Dante, Virgil and the group of devils standing at the left border of the design.  His right leg is forward and his left leg is extended backward.  He extends his right arm up at 135 degrees and draws it back towards the group at the left.  His palm is raised upward.  His left arm is down and bent forward at the elbow; he holds a large shepherd's crook or hook in his left hand.  Nude, he has large bat-like wings spread wide, and a long tail that curves between his legs.  Horns grow from his forehead.  He has short curly hair.  His mouth curves in a smile.  Virgil and Dante stand together between Barbariccia and the other devils.  They both face right with slightly lowered heads.  Both men have long hair and wear gowns.  Faint coloring indicates that Dante (in red) stands farther right, slightly in front of Virgil.  Dante turns his head forward and lowers his eyes.  His right arm is down by his side.  One or both feet may be visible beneath the hem of his gown.  Virgil looks to the right with eyes raised.  A small crowd of nude demons stands together at the left side of the design.  All four of the most clearly delineated demons seem to be male.  Farthest left a particularly muscular devil stands facing away with his legs spread.  His bent right arm is raised and extended out to the right at 45 degrees, with palm down.  His right index finger may be extended in a pointing gesture.  He turns his head to the left so that his face is visible in partial profile, looking down.  He has short curly hair and bat-like wings.  A long tail falls between his legs.  At the right of the crowd, a second devil faces forward in a contrapposto position, with his weight resting mostly on his left leg and his right leg bent and possibly crossed behind the left at the ankle.  The large tusks that protrude from his open mouth identify this devil as Ciriatto.  Additional teeth are visible between his lips.  His bat-like wings are curled around his body at the waist and hips, so that they help to hide his genitals.  His lower left arm is raised at his side and he grasps the handle of a hook with this hand.  His right arm is bent across his chest and he rests his right index finger on the hook in a pointing gesture.  He has short curly hair and prominent eyebrows over eyes turned sharply to the right to look at Dante and Virgil.  Two devils are penciled lightly in between Ciriatto and the devil seen from behind at the left.  The leftmost of these two in the middle faces forward and turns his head slightly to the right.  His eyes are swiveled to the right.  He may be smiling with an open mouth.  His left leg is forward.  His left forearm is bent up at his side and he holds the haft of an upraised hook in this hand.  His bat-like wings appear above his head.  He has short curly hair.  The head of the second devil in the middle is visible above Ciriatto's right shoulder, turned slightly right to look torwards Dante and Virgil.  The devil curls his lips in a somewhat silly smile.  This may be Rubicant.  He seems to have short hair; two small horns may spring from his forehead, one above each eye.  His bent leg appears to the right of Ciriatto's bent right leg.  Faint pencil lines just visible above and to the left of the demon farthest left may indicate yet another demon, the fifth in this grouping.  The group of demons bristles with raised hooks.  One hook appears above the right shoulder of the demon farthest left.  The lightly penciled demon second to left holds a hook in his upraised left hand.  Ciriatto, farthest right, holds one in his left hand.  A fourth hook is raised to the left of Ciriatto's head.  The figures stand or stride along a path of bare earth that runs the length of the bottom of the design.  The lake of boiling pitch appears in the middle distance across the design.  Its bank, above the path, may be covered with grass.  A rocky mound rises in the background at the right, on the far bank of the lake.  Fire burns on the lake, particularly along its edges.  More flames and possibly smoke fill the upper right corner of the design.  Wash above and around the figures suggests a fiery sky.

His right leg is forward and his left leg is extended backward.  He extends his right arm up at 135 degrees and draws it back towards the group at the left.  His palm is raised upward.  His left arm is down and bent forward at the elbow; he holds a large hook or shepherd's crook in his left hand.  Nude, he has large bat-like wings spread wide, and a long tail that curves between his legs.  Horns grow from his forehead.  He has short curly hair.  His mouth curves in a smile.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The setting of this design is the lake of pitch in the eighth circle of hell.  The lake extends across the design.  A great stone bridge arches over the foreground.  It is anchored at left and right on the bare bank that runs along the bottom of the design.  Three additional bridges over the lake recede away.  Fire burns on the pitch beneath the farthest bridge (in the middle of the design) and the second farthest bridge (at the left side of the design).  A group of figures in the lower left corner includes Dante, Virgil, Barbariccia, and their devil companions.  Barbariccia is farthest right, standing or walking facing away with his legs spread.  He extends his left arm up at higher than 135 degrees with his palm facing up.  His bent right arm is raised at 135 degrees and he grasps the handle of a large hook or staff with his right hand.  The other end of the staff may rest on the ground.  His bat-like wings are spread and he turns his head to the left to look at his followers.  He is nude and has short hair.  Dante and Virgil stand or walk shoulder-to-shoulder to the left of Barbariccia.  They are difficult to distinguish from each other.  Both face forward and to the right, wear long gowns, and have long hair.  The figure to the left partly blocks his companion.  This figure's right arm is down by his side; his left forearm is bent up before him with his left hand raised and left palm forward and out.  The figure to the right, slightly behind, bends his head down.  Neither of his arms are visible.  A group of indistinct devils appears to the left of Dante and Virgil.  The two easiest to distinguish among Blake's penciled lines face right in single file.  The rightmost devil walks with his right arm slightly forward and bent up.  He holds the haft of a hook in his upraised right hand.  His left leg is bent and his left foot is on tiptoe. His head may be lowered.  The leftmost devil walks with his right leg bent and his right foot on tiptoe.  His right arm may be bent across his torso.  Both demons seem to be nude, and may have spiky bat-like wings behind their backs.  Penciled sketches between the devils and to the left of the leftmost devil indicate additional devils, difficult to distinguish from each other.  At least three more hooks appear above the devils' heads.  Six or perhaps seven heads emerge from the water near the bank in the lower right corner of the design.  These are the heads of sinners immersed in the pitch.  One at the right may extend his or her arm and hand horizontally along the bank to the left.</illusobjdesc>

Fire burns on the pitch beneath the farthest bridge (in the middle of the design) and the second farthest bridge (at the left side of the design).</illusobjdesc>

His bent right arm is raised at 135 degrees and he grasps the handle of a large hook or staff with his right hand.  The other end of the staff may rest on the ground.  His bat-like wings are spread and he turns his head to the left to look at his followers.  He is nude and has short hair.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place in the eighth circle of hell.  Ciampolo, a corrupt former public servant, stands at the left side of the design.  His right arm is bent forward at the elbow and he holds his right hand out with his palm forward.  His left arm, slightly bent, is down and his palm is out.  The hook that the devil to the right brandishes rips a loop of flesh from the bicep of Ciampolo's left arm.  Ciampolo's head rests on his left shoulder.  His mouth is open with teeth and tongue showing, and his eyes are swiveled to look in pain and horror at the wound to his arm.  Blood and gore drips from the torn flesh.  He has short, curly hair and is nude with visible genitals.  At the right side of the design, several nude male demons perch together on a boulder.  The body of the demon in the front faces right, but he twists his neck back and left to look torwards Ciampolo.  His face, with his mouth open in a smile, is seen in three-quarters profile.  He is nude and he has a beard and short, curly hair.  His right leg is bent and drawn in towards the rock, while his bent left leg dangles.  (Alternatively, his left heel may rest gently against the rock below, near the pitch.)  His right arm is raised at about 45 degrees and extended to the right, in front of him.  He holds a staff, spear, or similar weapon in his right hand.  His bat-like wings are wrapped around his shoulders and arms.  Behind him, the second demon, Libicocco, straddles the rock facing forward and extends his right leg down to the left.  His right foot rests on the bank on tiptoe.  His left leg is out to the right, bent with left heel propped against the rock.  His head is tilted right but he looks forward, mouth open in a smile and eyes looking out to the right. He has long curly hair and bat-like wings spread wide on either side of his body.  He reaches his right arm horizontally out to the left and uses a sharp hook to wound Ciampolo.  The head of a third demon is visible above the second demon's right arm, facing forward and to the left and tilted back to look up.  His eyes are raised.  This demon has short curly hair.  His wings are visible above his head.  Lightly penciled lines indicate the head and shoulders of a fourth demon near the upper right corner of the design.  This demon faces forward and left with lowered eyes.  Tusks grow from his mouth, identifying him as Ciriatto.  He has short curly hair and bat-like wings visible to the right of his head.  The three seated demons perch on a rock at the right side of the design.  A similar rock is partly visible at the left side of the design.  Both rocks sit on a bare, rocky bank or shore of the lake of boiling pitch, which appears between the rocks.  Penciled lines above the pitch suggest flames or steam rising from the surface of the pitch.  Wash surrounding the figures suggests the sky, perhaps at sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>At the right side of the design, several nude male demons perch together on a boulder.  The body of the demon in the front faces right, but he twists his neck back and left to look towards Ciampolo.  His face, with his mouth open in a smile, is seen in three-quarters profile.  He is nude and he has a beard and short, curly hair.  His right leg is bent and drawn in towards the rock, while his bent left leg dangles.  (Alternatively, his left heel may rest gently against the rock below, near the pitch.)  His right arm is raised at about 45 degrees and extended to the right, in front of him.  He holds a staff, spear, hook, or similar weapon in his right hand.  His bat-like wings are wrapped around his shoulders and arms.

His left leg is out to the right, bent with left heel propped against the rock.  His head is tilted right but he looks forward, mouth open in a smile and eyes looking out to the right.  He has long curly hair and bat-like wings spread wide on either side of his body.  He reaches his right arm horizontally out to the left and uses a sharp hook to cut flesh from Ciampolo's left arm.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place in the eighth circle of hell.  The lake of boiling pitch stretches across the lower border of the design.  Its liquid roils in whirls or waves.  Flames lick up from its surface, particularly at the banks and in the troughs of waves.  Two devils attack one another in the air over the lake.  Nude and muscular, they use the sharp claws on their hands to assail each other.  The devil on the left flies or hovers with his body in a horizontal position.  His torso faces down, though he bends backwards or lifts his shoulders and tilts his head back to look to the right.  He twists at the waist so that his hips and legs face away towards the far shore of the lake, and are seen from behind.  His left leg, slightly bent, extends to the left while his right leg is bent at the knee.  The soles of both feet are visible.  His bent arms are spread wide, with the right down and the left up.  With the right palm down and left palm vertical and out, he spreads his fingers like talons.  His jagged, bat-like wings rise up to the left from behind his shoulders.  He has short, curly hair and his open mouth is drawn into a smile or a grimace.  On the right, the opposing devil flies or hovers with his lower body extended to the right, facing forward.  His right leg is bent and his genitals are visible.  He twists at the waist; his torso faces down but he bends backwards or lifts his shoulders to look forward.  His head is turned slightly left.  He raises his right arm vertically and bends it right, over his head.  His left arm is raised horizontally and bent up at the elbow, palm up and out towards the viewer.  Like his opponent, his mouth is open in a smile or grimace.  His teeth are visible.  He has short, curly hair.  His bat-like wings extend from his back.  Gentle hills form the far bank of the lake.  Groups of demons sit on several of these mounds at the right.  Sitting and standing, they seem to have gathered to watch the pair of demons fight over the water.  A larger hill rises on the left, and craggy mountains appear in the distance on the right.  A path rises up from the lower left and circles around the larger hill.  Flames rise from what appears to be a smaller pool of pitch in the bank at the left edge of the design.  Larger and more threatening tongues of fire burn above the mountains on the right, at the horizon.  Wash above the hill on the left suggests the sky, which becomes dark over the fire on the right, perhaps with clouds of smoke.  Two figures representing Dante and Virgil stand on the path near the top of the design.  They are sketched faintly in pencil, but seem to face forward and to wear long gowns.

Her right arm is raised at 135 degrees and bent upward at the elbow with palm forward.  Her left arm is bent up at the elbow, which may be propped on her left thigh.  Her spiky wings are spread on either side of her body.  </illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>Several groups of demons have gathered on the far shore of the lake, at the right, watching the pair of demons fight over the water.  The shoulders and faces of two demons sitting closely side-by-side appear near the right edge of the design, above a seated female demon with visible breasts.  These two sitting together face forward and slightly left.  The one on the right may be holding a hook or other indistinct object in its upraised left hand.  Other features of these sketched figures are difficult to discern.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>A rock bridge spans the design.  The right leg of the bridge extends down the right side of the design.  A slender path is carved into this leg on the inside, near the bottom. Below the bridge, Dante and Virgil flee the demons massed above.  Virgil carries Dante and runs rightward with his bent left leg drawn forward and his right leg extended behind him to the left.  His left foot rests precariously on tiptoe at the edge of a slender path carved into the underside of the bridge.  He leans forward sharply, but twists at the waist so that his torso faces forward.  Virgil grasps Dante around the waist with both of his arms bent.  He turns his head to look up to the left at the demons, his eyes raised and his mouth open.  Dante's body rests on Virgil's hip and torso, facing forward and nearly horizontal.  Dante's right leg is not visible; his left is extended straight out to the left.  Dante twists his shoulders down to the right and clasps Virgil with his left arm; his left hand rests on Virgil's left shoulder.  Dante extends his right arm straight in front of him, with palm out.  Like Virgil, he turns his head up to the left and raises his eyes to look at the demons.  Both Dante and Virgil have long curly hair and wear long transparent gowns that swirl around their legs and billow behind them.  Gentle hills sloping away into the distance are visible through the arch of the bridge.  These hills seem to be covered with grass.  Wash at the horizon suggests a distant lake or similar body of water.  Hooded sinners punished for hypocrisy stand or walk in a line circling a near hill on the left.  Only their upper bodies are visible, bending forward with bowed heads and hunched shoulders.  Their heavy cowls obscure their features.  A group of muscular demons, massed at the top of the design, pursue Virgil and Dante.  Their grouping bristles with hooks or similar weapons.  Their faces are turned to look at the two fleeing figures below.  A cloud floats over the distant landscape, visible through the arch of the stone bridge.  Wash in this area and around the demons above suggests the sky, perhaps at sunrise or sunset.

To the left of the first, foremost demon, nearer the upper left corner of the design, another demon flies or hovers with horizontal torso facing forward.  This demon tilts his head back and turns it down to the right slightly; his eyes are raised and his mouth is open to show his teeth.  His bent legs extend together diagonally up towards the upper left corner.  His left foot appears beyond his right knee.  He holds a hook in his left hand; this arm is by his side.  His right arm is down but bent up at the elbow with palm out.  He is nude and has short curly hair.  His wings are visible above his shoulders.

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place in the sixth trench of the eighth circle of hell.  Four hills fill the middle and background.  A shadowed cavelike cavity opens in the nearest hill.  The ground is flat and bare, though wash on the far hill on the right suggests grass.  A rock or boulder fills the lower left corner.  The flat, bare foreground is slightly lower than the plane of the middle ground.  A third, slightly higher level of ground appears in the mid-distance on the left, above the boulder.  Wash at the top of the design suggests a dark sky, particularly at the right side.  Dante and Virgil stand together at the right side of the design.  Their figures are sketched lightly in pencil, making it difficult to tell which is Dante and which Virgil.  Both wear long gowns and have long hair.  The man on the left faces forward and slightly left, but turns his head to the right to look at his companion.  His right arm is down by his side, palm facing down.  His left arm is bent across his torso.  The man on the right faces left, with his head bent forward.  His mouth may be open.  His left arm is bent up across his body and his left hand is raised, perhaps with palm facing up.  His left foot may emerge from below his gown.  To the left of Dante and Virgil lies a male figure stretched on a cross on the ground.  This is Caiaphas, the Jewish high priest who recommended the death of Jesus for political convenience.  In this image he lies supine, turning his head to face forward.  His legs are extended to the left; large nails or stakes driven through his feet hold them to the wood beneath.  His left arm is extended out horizontally from his body, stretching down to the right along the beam of the cross.  A nail pierces his open palm to anchor it to the cross.  He is nude except for a cloth wrapped around his pelvis, but his long curly beard spills over his torso and hides much of it.  His long hair falls backwards onto the ground below.  His eyes are wide and his mouth is open.  A line of hypocrites files around the left side of the nearest hill, rising as the figures come rightward and closer to Caiaphas.  They bend over, hunched beneath their friars' habits, their heads bowed under heavy cowls that cover their faces completely.  Their arms are bent up at the elbow and their hands are hidden.  The hypocrite nearest Caiaphas steps on him, with his right leg bent and drawn up and his right foot resting on Caiaphas' torso.  Otherwise this figure maintains his hunched posture.  The line of hypocrites resumes below Caiaphas, now marching facing left.  More distant hypocrites in single file are also visible before the far hill on the left, as a series of lightly sketched shapes.  A group of nude, muscular demons flies or hovers in the sky near the upper left corner of the design.  The body of the demon farthest right is horizontal.  His lower body faces down, with right leg extended and left leg bent and drawn forward, but he twists at the waist so that his torso faces forward.  His head is bent back and his mouth may be open and smiling.  Both feet are pointed into tiptoes.  He reaches his right arm horizontally past his head to the left, and his left arm out to the right; with his left hand he grasps a large hook shaped like a shepherd's crook.  He has short, curly hair.  Bat-like wings rise from his shoulders.  The demon second from right is seen from behind, his lower body facing down and his body mostly horizontal.  He flies or hovers with legs extended to the right, and reaches his arms horizontally out to either side.  The soles of both of his feet are visible.  He lifts his upper body to face away and to the left.  His head is bent back and he seems to have short hair.  His bat-like wings are spread wide.  The demon nearest the top edge of the design flies or hovers with body facing down and extended away from the viewer, but head bent back to look forward.  He has drawn his bent right leg up and extends his left leg out to the right.  His right arm reaches up at 135 degrees and he seems to hold a hook in this upraised right hand.  His bat-like wings are raised above his back.  He seems to have short hair.  Below him and to the left a fourth demon stretches diagonally towards the upper left corner of the design, facing forward with right leg bent and drawn up and left leg extended obliquely down to the right.  Both feet are pointed into tiptoes.  He turns his head to the left, so that his face is visible in three-quarters profile; his head is bent back as well.  He raises his right arm at 135 degrees, brandishing a hook in his upraised right hand.  His bat-like wings appear above his shoulders.  He seems to be bald, but a small horn sprouts from his left temple.  The demon nearest the left edge of the design dives or falls diagonally down to the left, his body facing forward though he turns his head to look down.  He bends left at the waist.  Both legs are bent, the left more than the right.  His genitals are visible.  His left arm is raised and bent over his head while his right is extended down to the left.  He holds a hook in his right hand.  He has short hair.  He does not have visible wings.

                        <illusobjdesc>A line of hypocrites files around the left side of the nearest hill, rising as the figures come rightward and closer to Caiaphas.  They bend over, hunched beneath their friars' habits, their heads bowed under heavy cowls that cover their faces completely.  Their arms are bent up at the elbow and their hands are hidden.  The hypocrite nearest Caiaphas steps on him, with his right leg bent and drawn up and his right foot resting on Caiaphas' torso.  Otherwise this figure maintains his hunched posture.  The line of hypocrites resumes below Caiaphas, now marching facing left.  More distant hypocrites in single file are also visible before the far hill on the left, as a series of lightly sketched shapes.</illusobjdesc>

His lower body faces down, with right leg extended and left leg bent and drawn forward, but he twists at the waist so that his torso faces forward.  His head is bent back and his mouth may be open and smiling.  Both feet are pointed into tiptoes.  He reaches his right arm horizontally past his head to the left, and his left arm out to the right; with his left hand he grasps a large hook shaped like a shepherd's crook.  He has short, curly hair.  Bat-like wings rise from his shoulders.

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place in the eighth circle of hell, in the wreckage of a rock bridge, now only a cliff.  The enormous boulders of this fallen bridge fill the left side of the design.  Although the rocky masses are only lightly sketched, wash indicates areas of shadow.  Even fainter lines in the lower right corner of the design may indicate more rock.  A cloud curves up from the lower right corner through the right side of the design.  The tiny figures of Dante and Virgil appear on the tumbled boulders of the ruined bridge.  Dante stands higher than Virgil, facing left.  He reaches both arms overhead at 135 degrees.  He may wear a gown.  One of his legs may be extended backwards; alternatively this line may represent merely the shape of his clothing.  Other features are difficult to discern.  Virgil is positioned below and to the right of Dante, facing left and leaning forward.  He climbs from a lower boulder onto the one on which Dante stands.  His left leg is bent and drawn up, with knee and lower leg resting on the higher rock.  His right leg is extended down behind him to the right, and his right foot is planted on the lower rock.  One arm (perhaps his right) is extended in front of him nearly horizontally; this hand may rest on the higher rock.  The other arm (perhaps his left) seems to be bent and drawn back behind him.  Other features, including his clothing, are difficult to discern.

                        <illusobjdesc>Virgil is positioned below and to the right of Dante, facing left and leaning forward.  He climbs from a lower boulder onto the one on which Dante stands.  His left leg is bent and drawn up, with knee and lower leg resting on the higher rock.  His right leg is extended down behind him to the right, and his right foot is planted on the lower rock.  One arm (perhaps his right) is extended in front of him nearly horizontally; this hand may rest on the higher rock.  The other arm (perhaps his left) seems to be bent and drawn back behind him.  Other features, including his clothing, are difficult to discern.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place in the eighth circle of hell, amid the wreckage of a ruined rock bridge.  One half of its original arch still stands, and is visible at the left of the design.  It is rooted in the ground at the left edge of the design and curves up to the right.  Stone rubble from the fallen half of the original bridge fills much of the right side of the design.  Large boulders from the bridge now form a tumbled pile.  A hill or low mountain appears in the distance, visible between the rubble of the bridge at the right, and the half of the arch that still stands at the left.  Faint lines above and to the left of this mountain suggest a second, more distant hill or mountain.  Wash that surrounds the broken arch at the left suggests the sky.  A long cloud, or series of clouds, curl up from above the distant mountain and around the broken arch of the bridge.  Dante and Virgil appear on the rubble of the broken bridge at the right.  Dante stands above, facing forward and to the right.  His arms are by his side and bent forward, with his hands raised.  At least his left palm seems to face up.  He wears a long gown, but otherwise his features are difficult to distinguish.  Virgil stands or climbs below Dante to the right.  He faces away and bends slightly to the right at the waist.  He rests his weight on his right leg and his left leg is extended backwards; his left foot may be on tiptoe.  He seems to be wearing a gown, but other features are difficult to distinguish.  Two faint figures are barely visible above the standing half of the bridge, near the top of the design at the left.  These may represent demons that Blake sketched and then erased or covered with wash.  They seem to stand side by side facing forward.  Their other features are indistinguishable.

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place in the seventh trench of the eighth circle of hell, where thieves are punished.  Flames lick up from the floor almost to the top edge of the design.  Dark wash between the flames at the left suggests smoke or a dark sky.  The floor of the trench seems to be bare earth.  A cliff appears at the right side of the design, in the middle distance.  The tiny figure of a demon stands at the edge of the cliff.  This figure faces forward, slightly crouched with both legs bent.  Its left foot may be on tiptoe.  It raises both arms at 45 degrees and holds a club or similar weapon, or possibly a cross, in its left hand.  Leaning and bending to the left, it lowers its head and peers down over the edge of the cliff.  It may be nude; other features are difficult to distinguish.  A sinner hurtles down past the left side of the cliff.  Head down, this figure faces forward or away with extended arms straight overhead.  Other features are difficult to distinguish.  Five thieves occupy the foreground of the design.  The rightmost of them, a male, runs facing left.  His bent right leg is drawn forward and his weight rests on this foot; his bent left leg is extended backward with the toes pointed into tiptoe.  Nude, he has visible genitals.  His left arm is at his side and bent up behind his back at the elbow; his left forearm rests on his right forearm at the small of his back.  His right hand lies on his hip with palm down and fingers spread.  A serpent may bind his arms and wrap his waist.  Leaning forward, he also bends his head back sharply to look up.  His mouth is open.  His short curly hair flies behind his head.  The second from right is a nude female with visible breasts who stands facing forward and to the right with her arms drawn behind her back: her right arm is visible to the elbow, while only the very top of her upper left arm can be seen.  She stands with both legs slightly bent and her lower body facing forward and to the right.  Bending right at the waist, she twists her torso forward and turns her head to the left so that her face is visible in three-quarters profile looking up to the left.  Her mouth is open and her eyes are raised.  She seems to have short curly hair.  The body of a snake curls down from behind her right hip.  The figure in the middle is a male who kneels on the ground with his legs together.  His lower body faces left but he twists at the waist so that his torso faces forward.  He leans backwards, and tilts his head back so sharply that his face is only partly visible.  His left arm is not visible.  His right arm, visible only to the elbow, is by his side and drawn back.  The body of a snake coils around his waist from the right side of his torso into his lap.  A nude male stands second from left, facing away.  His weight rests on his right leg, while his left leg is slightly bent and extended behind him.  His left foot is on tiptoe.  His arms are down, bent across the small of his back, and crossed at the wrists.  Several snakes have coiled themselves around his wrists to bind them; one snake's head lies along the man's left forearm while the other is lifted above his right forearm.  His hands dangle, palms vertical and facing out.  His head is bent down and his long hair drapes over his face and down between his shoulder blades.  The thief farthest left is a nude woman who lies on the ground on her side, facing forward.  Her bent left leg is visible to the knee.  Her right arm lies horizontally along the ground, bent up at the elbow around her head, which is turned to look up.  Her left arm is hidden.  Her mouth is open.  Her long hair falls back from her temple and spills onto the ground near her elbow.  The body of a large serpent is wound around her waist.  Another large snake undulates across the ground from left to right in the middle distance, near the left edge of the design.  The creature has the torso and breasts of a woman, lifted from the ground and facing forward.  Instead of arms, however, it raises wings that form a hood over her head.  Smaller feathers emerge from its armpits.  Its skull-like head, with bird-like eyes, a beaky nose, and a gruesome smile, is turned slightly left.  It has short, curly hair, or perhaps its head is covered with smaller feathers.  Its body extends to the left.  Above the large serpent with the torso of a woman, a second snake appears further in the distance.  It curls its body in an incomplete loop raised from the ground.  Its body extends to the left.  It has a human-like head, facing forward and to the left.  Its nose also suggests the nasal cavity of a skull; its mouth curls in an open smile.  It may be bald, or may have short wispy hair.  Above the two snakes on the ground, a third lifts its body vertically, head facing up and mouth open.  This snake has several scaly appendages extending from its body, and one (crest-like) from the top of its head.

                        <illusobjdesc>Five thieves occupy the foreground of the design.  The rightmost of them, a male, runs facing left.  His bent right leg is drawn forward and his weight rests on this foot; his bent left leg is extended backward with the toes pointed into tiptoe.  Nude, he has visible genitals.  His left arm is at his side and bent up behind his back at the elbow; his left forearm rests on his right forearm at the small of his back.  His right hand lies on his hip with palm down and fingers spread.  A serpent may bind his arms and wrap his waist.  Leaning forward, he also bends his head back sharply to look up.  His mouth is open.  His short curly hair flies behind his head.</illusobjdesc>

The second from right is a nude female with visible breasts who stands facing forward and to the right with her arms drawn behind her back: her right arm is visible to the elbow, while only the very top of her upper left arm can be seen.  She stands with both legs slightly bent and her lower body facing forward and to the right.  Bending right at the waist, she twists her torso forward and turns her head to the left so that her face is visible in three-quarters profile looking up to the left.  Her mouth is open and her eyes are raised.  She seems to have short curly hair.  The body of a snake curls down from behind her right hip.</illusobjdesc>

His lower body faces left but he twists at the waist so that his torso faces forward.  He leans backwards, and tilts his head back so sharply that his face is only partly visible, from below.  His left arm is not visible.  His right arm, visible only to the elbow, is by his side and drawn back.  The body of a snake coils around his waist from the right side of his torso into his lap.</illusobjdesc>

Smaller feathers emerge from its armpits.  Its skull-like head, with bird-like eyes, a beaky nose, and a gruesome smile, is turned slightly left.  It has short, curly hair, or perhaps its head is covered with smaller feathers.  Its body extends to the left.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place in the seventh trench of the eighth circle of hell.  At least seven thieves and three serpents appear.  A flat bank runs across the bottom edge of the design; above it a stream rippled with wavelets is visible, especially nearer the right edge of the design.  A small flat island is visible in the stream, right of center.  A rock or small boulder appears above the lower left corner.  Wash across the top of the design suggests a dark sky, except for a lighter area in the upper left corner.  One of the sinners, a female, kneels at the left side of the design.  Nude with visible breasts, she faces forward and to the right, with her legs bent and her right leg drawn up beneath her body.  Her torso leans away and bends to the left slightly, and she may be resting some of her weight on her right arm, which is down.  Her right hand rests on the ground, palm down.  She leans her head sharply to the left so that her right cheek touches her right shoulder.  Her head is also bent back, and her long curly hair cascades down behind her right arm.  One strand of her hair lies along her left shoulder.  The head and right arm of another female thief are visible above and to the left of the female kneeling at the left side of the design.  This second female's arm is down, and her right hand rests on the ground with palm down.  Her head is tilted back and to the left, so that her face is visible in three-quarters profile looking left.  She leans her right cheek on her right shoulder.  Her eyelids are lowered or closed.  Her mouth may be open slightly.  She has long curly hair.  An indistinct shape in the upper left corner of the design may be part of another thief.  The upper body of another thief, a nude male, appears to the right.  His torso faces forward and to the left.  He seems to lean back and may bend to the right slightly; he tilts his head back and turns it right, so that he looks up to the right.  His left cheek may rest on his left shoulder.  His eyes are raised and his mouth is slightly open.  A female thief stands at the center of the design, curving her nude body dramatically rightward.  His legs are together, slightly bent at the knees and facing away.  Her lower body is thus seen from behind.  She twists and bends to the right at the waist, curling her upper body over so that her shoulders and breasts face down.  Her head is lowered and turned slightly forward, so that her face is visible in three-quarters profile beneath her right arm, which is raised horizontally and bent behind her head.  Her long curly hair hangs down past her head.  Her open left hand, with palm down and fingers spread, appears to the right of her head.  
                    
                    The body of another thief is positioned nearest the upper right corner of the design, seated on a small flat island within the stream.  This figure seems to be male.  His head is hidden behind the head of the woman who stands at the center and curls her body rightward.  He sits with his legs extended down to the left.  His left leg is bent and raised slightly higher than the right.  Both legs are hidden below the knee, and seem to be immersed in the waters of the stream.  He twists forward at the waist, and leans back.  His upper right arm is visible almost to the elbow, down by his side.  His left forearm is visible below his torso, down and drawn back.  His left hand rests on the ground, palm down.  Irregular lines above his hand may be his long curly hair, or may be more of the long hair of the woman whose head obscures his own.  A serpent's body undulates up between the knees of this male thief who sits near the upper right corner of the design.  It curls over his left thigh, touching the ground next to his hip before lifting its head to look up.  A thief, visible between eyes and knees, lies supine in the lower right corner of the design.  Though this figure is nude, it is difficult to tell whether the thief is male or female.  Neither arm is visible.  The figure's head is turned slightly forward.  A snake lies along the torso of this thief lying face-up in the lower right corner of the design.  Its head is near the thief's breastbone, while its tail curls between the thief's legs. The nude buttocks and waist of another thief, sitting in the distance and facing away, are visible above the hips of a male thief sitting near the upper right corner of the design.  The position of his or her waist suggests this thief is leaning back slightly.  A serpent lies along the ground in the lower left corner of the design.  It lifts its head to look up with an open mouth.  Its head casts a shadow on the stone or earth below.

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place in the seventh trench of the eighth circle of hell.  The floor of the trench seems to be flat, bare earth.  Three mountains cross the design above the floor of the trench: one mountain rises in the middle, overlapped by another to either side.  Lines across the bottom of the mountain on the left and across the ridge of the mountain on the right suggest a road or path.  Vanni Fucci, a thief who lied about having robbed the church of San Zeno, runs leftward in the foreground of this design.  He strides facing left with his bent left leg forward and his bent right leg extended backward.  His right foot is on tiptoe.  He bends forward at the waist and tilts his head back, turning his face up to look up over his shoulder to the right.  His eyes are raised and his mouth is open.  His right arm is extended at 45 degrees in front of him, slightly bent; his right hand is open with fingers spread and palm down.  His left arm is also slightly bent and raised at 45 degrees, but drawn back.  His left palm is down.  The head of a serpent is poised in the act of biting Vanni Fucci in the left shoulder.  The reptile's body curls up to the right and then down behind Fucci's torso to the ground before his left foot.  A row of fire burns across the design, in front of the mountains.  More flames appear between Fucci's feet.  Smaller flames may be visible in the distance on either side of Fucci's right hand and to the left and right of his left calf.  Another serpent lies along the ground in the lower left corner of the design.  This serpent's head is raised and looks forward.  Its body curls to the right and then the left as it approaches the bottom of the design.  Large spikes rise from its back along the length of its body.  A third snake appears in the lower right corner of the design.  Its head is raised and looks up to the right; it is seen from above and behind.  Its body forms a loop below and to the left of its head.  It may cast a thin shadow on the ground.  A fourth snake undulates along the ground before the mountain on the right.  Its head is raised and looks forward, while its body forms two or perhaps three curls extending to the left.  A large cloud fills much of the sky above the central mountain.  Rays of light stream from the sun as it sets behind the mountain.  Wash around the rays suggests the ambient light from the sunset.  Dark wash in the upper right and left corners of the design suggests a dark sky.

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place in the seventh trench of the eighth circle of hell.  The floor of the trench, at the bottom of the design, consists of several levels of flat earth.  Shadows cross the nearest level, closest to the bottom of the design.  A rock bridge crosses from the lower right corner past the left edge of the design.  A line of flames is visible rising from the ground beneath the arch of the bridge.  Dark wash between the tongues of fire and the bridge suggests smoke.  A rock cliff is visible at the right side of the design, beyond the base of the rock bridge.  Dante and Virgil stand together at the right side of the design, facing forward.  Dante, on the left, hides his companion slightly.  He turns his head to the left so that his face is seen in three-quarters profile.  His right arm (and apparently his left) are down by his side and bent up at the elbow; both of his hands are raised with vertical palms facing out towards the viewer.  Virgil, on the right, stands with his head turned slightly to the left as well.  His left forearm is raised in front of his torso and his vertical palm faces out.  The two figures stand on a small, flat rock ledge in the lower right corner of the design.  The thief Vanni Fucci stands to the left of Dante and Virgil, facing forward.  His right leg is bent and at least his right foot is on tiptoe.  Both of his slightly bent arms are raised vertically.  He uses both hands to taunt the gods with the sign of the &quot;figs.&quot;
                    His eyes are raised and his mouth is open.  His short hair stands on end.  A serpent circles Vanni Fucci's upraised left arm.  Its head is raised, looking up with mouth open.  Its body loops his arm loosely before undulating towards the ground below.  Its tail dangles.  Another serpent tightly encircles Vanni Fucci's neck, with its head lying facing down on his chest and its tail extended up above his head.  Its mouth is open and its forked tongue emerges.  A third serpent springs up towards Fucci's right arm, its head pointed up and to the right and its undulant body extended down to the left.  Its mouth is open. Another, smaller snake lies on the ground behind Fucci's legs.  It lifts its head up to the right.  A large serpent is partially visible above the flat middle ground in front of the flames.  Its body curls up and over to the left, so that its head faces down to the right.  It is consuming a smaller snake.  Only the tail of this second snake is visible, emerging from the larger creature's open mouth.  Dark clouds cross the top of the design.  Lightning snakes jaggedly down towards Vanni Fucci from the upper left corner.  Flames burst from the dark clouds above and on either side of Fucci's upraised hands.  Wash between the mountains and the clouds at the top of the design suggests the sky.

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place in a trench of the eighth circle of hell.  The floor of the trench seems to be bare earth.  The figure of Cacus, a magnificent Centaur with the body of a horse and the head and torso of a man, fills the design.  He stands on his hind legs facing left.  His bent right foreleg is raised horizontally while his left foreleg is bent and drawn up beneath his body.  His nude human torso twists forward at the waist and he extends his arms out horizontally to either side.  He clasps a scepter or staff between the thumb and forefinger of his upraised left hand.  The head of this scepter may be a pine cone.  His right hand is open, with the palm down.  His head is tilted left, and may be bent forward as well.  He has a beard and long hair that cascades past his shoulders and rump.  His horse's tail billows similarly.  A small, scaly dragon perches on Cacus' head, its claws clutching his skull.  Facing forward, it leans its head down to the left past Cacus' right temple.  Its mouth is open, displaying its tongue and perhaps teeth.  It expels a gust of fire and/or wind over Cacus' right shoulder.  Spikes emerge from its head, shoulders, and back.  Its bat-like wings are spread wide to either side of its body.  Its long tail ripples behind Cacus, beneath his left arm.  A faintly drawn rock bridge crosses the length of the design, behind Cacus. Wash at the top of the design, on either side of Cacus' torso, suggests the sky. Flames spring from the ground along the bottom of the design, particularly around Cacus' rear hooves.  They are also visible in the distance under Cacus' abdomen. At least two serpents(?) lie on the ground in the distance, to the left of Cacus' left foreleg.  They are sketched faintly, but seem to face forward with raised heads.

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place in a trench of the eighth circle of hell.  The floor of the trench seems to be bare earth.  A mountain range with two low peaks crosses the design in the distance.  A smaller, lower mound or hill appears in front of each mountain.  Fire burns in the sky between the two mountains.  Wash above the mountain range suggests the sky, perhaps with clouds.  It is dark near the upper right corner of the design, but light above the mountain on the left.  Cianfa Donati, in the form of a many-limbed serpent, assaults Agnolo Brunelleschi, a nude and rather muscular male thief who stands at the center of the design.  Facing forward, Brunelleschi stands in a slightly crouching posture with his bent right leg forward and his bent left leg back slightly.  His head is bent sharply left by the serpent, which bites his jaw, and his mouth and eyes are wide with horror and pain.  His slightly bent right arm is extended at 45 degrees and drawn back.  His right hand is open, with fingers spread and palm out.  His left arm is at his side, bent up at the elbow with the palm of this hand facing the viewer and the fingers spread.  The giant serpent attacking Brunelleschi bends or hunches forward over the man's back and clutches him with all six clawed feet, its limbs bent around his body.  It lowers its head over the man's left shoulder to seize his jaw in its own open mouth.  Its long, snake-like tail emerges from between Brunelleschi's legs and coils twice around his right leg before trailing onto the ground.  The monster's large, bat-like wings appear above its shoulders.  A small rocky outcropping rises in the lower left corner of the design.  It may be covered with indistinct vegetation, perhaps grass.  Dante and Virgil stand together on a ledge in this outcropping.  Dante stands to the left, facing forward and partly hiding Virgil.  His straight arms are down by his side; his hands are open with palms down and fingers spread.  He bends his head down to the right, so that his face is visible in three-quarters profile, with his eyes lowered.  Virgil, slightly to the right of Dante, stands facing forward and to the right.  His head is lowered and he holds his forearms across his torso.  Two male figures stand together at the right side of the design.  Nude, they represent the spirits of Puccio Sciancato and Buoso Donati, Brunelleschi's fellow robbers.  Their individual identities are not distinguished.  The rightmost figure hides his companion slightly and faces away.  He stands in a contrapposto position, bending left at the waist with most of his weight on his right leg; his left leg is bent and extended backwards, with his left foot on tiptoe.  He turns his head left and bends it down, so that his face is seen in profile looking down to the left.  His right forearm, bent upward, is visible at the right of his torso.  His right hand as well as his left hand, which appears above his right shoulder, are open with palms facing forward and fingers spread.  The figure on the left faces forward in a slightly contrapposto position, with his weight shifted to his left leg and his right leg bent backwards.  He bends and twists slightly to the left and turns his head left, so that his face is visible in three-quarters profile.  Both of his forearms are raised horizontally, with his hands open, fingers spread, and palms out.  Snakes abound on the floor of the trench.  One appears to the right of Brunelleschi's feet, its body forming two incomplete loops and its head raised to look forward.  The heads of two snakes are visible to the right of the rocky outcropping in the lower left corner of the design.  Side-by-side, both look up; they may be watching the six-footed serpent attack Brunelleschi.  Between Brunelleschi and Virgil, a snake appears in the distance on the floor of the trench.  Its body coils into three raised loops.  To the right of Brunelleschi's left hip, another serpent is visible in the distance undulating along the floor of the trench.  Its head seems to be raised; it looks up.  Just below the mountain on the right, a snake's body curves up from the floor of the trench.  The head of another serpent is raised just to the left of the right edge of the design.  It looks forward and to the left with its mouth open.  The head and part of the body of a snake appears in the lower right corner of the design.  The reptile's head is raised and looks left with its mouth open, displaying a fang and perhaps an extended tongue.

The rightmost figure hides his companion slightly and faces away.  He stands in a contrapposto position, bending left at the waist with most of his weight on his right leg; his left leg is bent and extended backwards, with his left foot on tiptoe.  He turns his head left and bends it down, so that his face is seen in profile looking down to the left.  His mouth is open, displaying his teeth, and his short hair stands on end.  His right forearm, bent upward, is visible at the right of his torso.  His right hand as well as his left hand, which appears above his right shoulder, are open with palms facing forward and fingers spread.  The figure on the left faces forward in a slightly contrapposto position, with his weight shifted to his left leg and his right leg bent backwards.  His right foot is on tiptoe.  He bends and twists slightly to the left and turns his head left, so that his face is visible in three-quarters profile.  Both of his forearms are raised horizontally, with his hands open, fingers spread, and palms out.  His long curly hair falls over his shoulders.  His mouth is open, displaying his teeth.  His genitals are pictured.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place in a trench in the eighth circle of hell.  The floor of the trench seems to be flat bare earth.  Two rock bridges cross the scene in the background of the design.  One arches rightward from the left edge of the design.  The second bridge extends leftward from the right edge of the design, and partially hides the base of the first.  Clouds extend almost completely across the top of the design.  Lightning erupts leftward from the cloud in the upper left corner, and flames burst from underneath the same cloud.  Wash between the clouds and the rock bridges suggests the sky, which is dark above the left bridge where the lightning suggests a storm, and lighter across the rest of the design.  The figure of Agnolo Brunelleschi, who is depicted here in the process of merging with the six-footed serpent from the previous design, fills much of this design.  Nude, he stands at the center, facing forward and slightly left.  His slightly bent left arm is down by his side, with the hand open, the fingers spread, and the palm facing away.  His right arm is also down, but bent out to the left at the elbow.  His head is bent sharply right, so that his left cheek touches his left shoulder.  He bends backwards and his frame, especially in the shoulders and arms, seems to convulse.  His staring eyes are rolled upwards and his lips are drawn into a grimace, displaying teeth that have become pointed.  Tusks have emerged above his mouth.  Short, curly human hair covers his head, but scales have begun to appear on his skin.  They are particularly noticeable on his cheeks, his chest, his pubic area, and his thighs.  His nails have sharpened into claws, especially on his feet.  A long tail now snakes down through his legs and across his left ankle.  Small bat-like wings grow above his shoulders.  A large snake lies loosely coiled on the ground at Brunelleschi's feet.  Its head is near the lower left corner of the design, facing right and possibly raised slightly to look at Brunelleschi.  The snake's mouth is open.  A spiky crest appears on and behind his head.  Flames spring from the ground beneath the bridge on the right.  The head and part of the body of a serpent curls up from the ground, out of the flames.  The head of the serpent faces right.  Flames also fill the space between the ground and the bottom of the bridge on the left.  The head of a serpent appears before these flames as well.  It is raised and looks forward.  Another snake is partly visible between the two bridges.  Its body emerges to the left but curls around so that its head faces forward and to the right.

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place in a trench in the eighth circle of hell.  The floor of the trench seems to be flat earth.  Tongues of fire leap from the floor of the trench nearly to the top of the design, forming a backdrop extending horizontally across the design.  Clouds also cross the top of the design.  More flames burst downward from the clouds in the upper left corner.  Buoso Donati stands at the right side of the design; he has just been bitten by a snake.  He is nude and his navel displays the wound from the serpent's bite.  He bends to the left at the waist and lowers his head to look down at the serpent below and to the left.  His mouth is open in a yawn, as Dante's text describes, displaying his teeth and tongue.  Alternatively, he may be crying out in pain.  His expression suggests surprised confusion.  The short hair around his head stands on end; longer locks fall past his shoulders.  Both of his arms are down, but bent upward at the elbow.  His right arm crosses his torso with his open right hand raised, vertical palm facing away and fingers spread.  His left arm is raised to the right with the palm of this hand facing out and up to the right and the fingers spread.  The snake that has just bitten Buoso Donati appears below him to the left.  It seems to be suspended in the air in the process of falling back to earth.  Both the wound and the serpent emit smoke, together forming a cloud that links the snake's mouth with the injury it created.  Dante and Virgil stand together at the left edge of the design, on a slightly raised stone mound in the lower left corner.  Dante stands slightly to the left of Virgil, facing forward.  He bends to the right and turns his head rightward so that his face is seen in three-quarters profile.  His head is also bent down slightly.  His arms are down by his side and bent at the elbows, so that his forearms are horizontal.  His hands are raised, with vertical palms facing out towards the viewer.  Virgil, to the right of and slightly hidden by Dante, faces forward and to the right.  He bends his head and turns it right, so that his face is visible in profile.  The nude figure of Puccio Sciancato, one of Brunelleschi's fellow robbers, stands just to the right of Dante and Virgil.  Sciancato stands in an awkward posture: his lower body faces right but he twists forward at the waist, while his shoulders face slightly left.  He turns his slightly bent head back to the right, so that his face is seen in three-quarters profile looking right.  He also leans backward slightly, away from Buoso Donati.  His right arm is extended down by his side and drawn back, with the palm of his open right hand facing down.  His left arm is bent up at the elbow and drawn across his torso.  His left hand makes a fist and may rest on his breastbone.  His right leg is forward, while his left leg is drawn back.  His mouth is open.  His facial expression and his body language together suggest fear.  A snake is crawling across the ground behind Sciancato.  It faces left and moves with its mouth open.  Small flames burn in a line across the floor of the trench.  Faint lines suggest that these flames begin at the left edge of the design, to the left of Dante's legs, but they are first clearly visible between Virgil and Sciancato.  They extend as far right as Donati's right leg.

The end of its tail may rest along Donati's right thigh; the rest of its body curls around to form an incomplete loop so that its head faces back up to the right towards Donati's face.  Small spiky scales or a crest appears behind its head.  Its mouth is open slightly.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place in a trench in the eighth circle of hell.  The floor of the trench suggests flat, bare earth.  Two rock bridges cross the design in the background.  The foremost is almost entirely visible, emerging from the left side of the design and arching to the right.  The second is partially hidden behind the first, and also extends beyond the right edge of the design.  A heavy cloud extends across the upper edge of the design from corner to corner.  Tongues of fire rain down to touch the bridges from the cloud above.  Wash visible between the flames at the top of the design, beneath the cloud, suggests a sky that is lit with fire at the left and dark with smoke at the right.  Fire burns below the bridge on the right.  A smaller cloud, or perhaps a column of smoke from the flames beneath the bridge on the right, rises diagonally across the upper right corner of the design.  Flames burn beneath the foremost bridge as well, at both bases.  Erratic lines above both fires suggest small clouds of smoke.  Francesco Guercio de' Cavalcanti stands facing forward just to the left of the middle of the design, near the bottom.  His weight is shifted to his right leg; his left leg is bent and his left foot is on tiptoe.  His arms are raised horizontally out from his torso, and bent up vertically at the elbows.  Both hands are open, with fingers spread and vertical palms facing forward.  His head is turned slightly left.  His eyes are raised.  His mouth is open, displaying his tongue and teeth.  His curly hair, which is short around his head and long at the nape of his neck, stands on end.  Buoso Donati, in the form of a large serpent, lies near the bottom of the design.  Most of its body lies horizontally behind de' Cavalcanti.  Its head is to the right, raised and lifted to look left and up towards de' Cavalcanti's head.  Its mouth is open.  After crossing behind de' Cavalcanti's feet, its body and the end of its tail trails away into the distance up to the right.  Another snake is penciled in lightly along the ground on the right, just before the bridges.  Its head faces left, and is raised with mouth open.  An undulating line beneath the fire at the left base of the foremost bridge may represent a third snake, indistinctly drawn.

                <illustration location="E" type="plate">
                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place in the eighth circle of hell.  A rock bridge fills much of this design.  Its bases are located in the lower left and right corners, and it curves through the top half of the design.  The ground below the bridge seems to be flat earth.  Through the arch of the bridge, in the distance, a low mound or small hill appears.  Wash above and below the arch of the bridge suggests the sky.  It is light in the upper right corner as well as near the base of the bridge on the right.  The sky grows increasingly dark across the segment visible beneath the bridge, and is darkest in the upper left corner of the design.  Shadow falls on the floor of the trench in the lower left corner of the design.  Dante and Virgil perch on the bridge, near the top of the design.  They are sketched lightly in pencil, so their features are difficult to discern and their identities difficult to tell apart.  Both figures face forward.  The figure on the left seems to sit with right knee drawn up.  His right arm, bent up at the elbow, rests on his right knee.  His raised right hand is at his chin.  The figure on the right seems to sit with both knees bent and drawn up.  His right hand is also bent up at the elbow, with elbow drawn forward and resting on right knee.  His raised right hand may rest against his shoulder or breastbone area.  His lower left arm may be similarly raised, visible to the right of his left shoulder, or may be extended down to the left.  A third figure is very lightly sketched left of Dante and Virgil; this may be an alternative version of either character.  Flames like large individual bulbs appear on the floor of the trench, each sending a tendril of fire upward.  Each holds the spirit of an advisor who lied.  Indistinct lines within the nearest flames suggest the presence of a figure inside each.  The figure in the largest flame, nearest the bottom of the design, seems to sit facing forward with bent legs drawn up.  One large flame with two points hovers near Dante and Virgil.  Ulysses and Diomed are visible within this flame.  The penciled figure of Ulysses sits at the right of the flame, facing forward and turning his head slightly right; he may be looking at Dante and Virgil on the bridge to the right.  His form is somewhat indistinct, but his bent right leg seems to be drawn beneath him, while his bent left knee is raised.  His right arm is down by his side, but bent at the elbow across his chest; his right hand may be raised or may rest against his left knee or left shoulder.  Diomed is also visible within the same large flame that hovers near the summit of the rock bridge.  He is seen mostly from behind; he bends right at the waist and his head and shoulders extend into the leftmost of the double points on the flame in which he appears with Ulysses.  His upper body is turned partly to the right, so that his face is seen in profile looking right.  His left arm is raised vertically overhead, and his upraised left hand is open with vertical palm facing out.  His left leg extends down to the right.  He seems to wear a gown, folds of which are visible to the right of his right thigh.</illusobjdesc>

They are sketched lightly in pencil, so their features are difficult to discern and their identities difficult to tell apart.  Both figures face forward, and seem to be wearing gowns.

His raised right hand is at his chin, and may rest on or support his chin.  The figure on the right seems to sit with both knees bent and drawn up.  His right hand is also bent up at the elbow, with elbow drawn forward and resting on right knee.  His raised right hand may rest against his shoulder or breastbone area.  He bends to the left slightly and may turn his head slightly left as well.  His lower left arm may be similarly raised, visible to the right of his left shoulder, or may be extended down by his left leg.  A third figure, or an alternative position for Dante or Virgil, is very lightly sketched just to the left of the others.  He(?) appears to be standing, head bent down and facing to the left.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place in hell.  Most of the figures stand on a flat, narrow bank that runs across the bottom of the design from corner to corner.  This bank may be covered with grass or moss.  Above it a lake stretches the length of the design.  Above the lake, two rock bridges arch across the design.  Flames, visible through the arch of the foremost bridge on the left, burn on the surface of the lake.  They may create smoke as well.  Large flames also burn in a line above the bridges.  More flames burn beneath the farther bridge.  They blow to the right, as if in a wind, and seem to produce clouds of smoke.  Wash above and below the bridges suggests the sky, which is light near the upper right corner and below the foremost bridge, but darker in the upper left corner and below the bridge on the right.  Bertrand de Born, a tiny headless figure, walks down the foremost bridge.  In his left hand he bears his own head, which sends out beams of light like a lantern.  Its mouth may be open.  A small island, perhaps covered with moss or grass, breaks the surface of the lake in the lower right quadrant of the design.  A nude male demon wielding a sword stands on this little island.  He faces forward in contrapposto, raising his right arm vertically overhead and brandishing the sword in this hand.  His left arm is down, bent out to the right at the elbow, with his left wrist and hand hidden behind his back.  His bat-like wings are raised vertically behind his back.  Three sinners, representing schismatics or heretics, cower in the lower right quadrant beneath the demon with the sword.  The sinner farthest right is a rather muscular nude male, who stands or strides facing left with his bent right leg forward.  His left leg is extended backwards and his left foot and ankle may be missing.  He leans forward and raises his right arm roughly vertically.  His head is bent back sharply, so that he can look up at the demon towering above.  His left arm is extended down and crosses the far side of his right knee; his left elbow may rest against the outside of this leg.  The male sinner in the middle of this group stands or steps facing left.  His bent left leg is forward; his bent right leg is extended behind him, with his right foot on tiptoe.  Bending forward, he twists at the waist, so that his torso faces right and slightly forward.  He also tilts his head back to look up at the demon above and to the right.  His right arm is down but bent across his torso at the elbow.  His left arm, slightly bent, is drawn back and raised vertically.  The leftmost of the three sinners before the demon stands or walks to the left with bent left leg forward.  He bends forward and twists at the waist, so that his torso faces forward and right.  His head is tilted back and turned slightly right.  His left forearm is visible above the head of his companion, extended vertically upward.  His right arm is down, bent across his chest at the elbow and partially hidden by his companion.  Blood stains his leg near the knee.  Blood has also pooled on the ground beneath the three sinners who cower in the lower right quadrant, and appears on the gown of the middle figure.  It also floats on the surface of the water between the bank where they stand and the island where the demon stands.  Dante and Virgil stand together near the middle of the design, at the bottom.  Dante is slightly right of Virgil, facing forward.  Both of his arms are by his side but bent at the elbow.  His right forearm crosses his chest and his upraised right hand is open with the vertical palm facing out and right.  His left arm is drawn back, and his left hand is open with the vertical palm facing out towards the viewer.  His head is tilted back to the left, and his eyes are wide with fear and shock.  He may be looking at Mohammed, to the left.  Virgil, slightly left of Dante, is largely hidden by him.  Virgil faces forward but tilts his head back and turns it slightly to the left.  His right arm, the only one that is even partly visible, is bent across his chest.  He has long hair and wears a long gown.  Mohammed stands to the left of Dante and Virgil.  He faces forward.  Nude, his torso is rent down the middle, displaying his vital organs.  His arms are raised at 45 degrees and bent towards his torso at the elbow.  With a hand on each side of his gaping laceration, he peels his skin back to show the organs inside.  His viscera spill out of this wound and down past his genitals.  A loop of his intestines circles around his head, over his shoulders; more of his intestines are visible below his right forearm, partially hidden behind his back.  He has long hair and a long beard.  Ali stands in the lower left corner of the design.  Contrapposto in position, he faces forward with his right leg bent forward slightly and his right foot on tiptoe.  His arms are folded across his chest, with his right forearm over his left wrist.  His left hand rests on his chest, while his right hand is raised with the palm roughly vertical and facing right.  A vertical cut through the center of his face drips blood from his chin.  He is nude and has short curly hair.  Three sinners proceed leftward, away from the demon that stands near the right side of the design.  One is visible to the left of Virgil and partly hidden by him.  This figure faces left with shoulders hunched and head bowed low.  The figure's left arm is by its side and bent up before its torso.  Its long hair is swept away over its neck and appears below its left elbow.  It wears a long gown with a belt.  The second of the sinners proceeding leftward is nude and walks or lunges between Ali and Mohammed, crouched low near the ground.  His bent right leg is forward; his bent left leg is extended backward with his left knee near the ground.  His shoulders are hunched and his head is lowered.  His left arm is extended down by his side.  His left hand is missing, as his arm is truncated above the wrist.  The third of the sinners proceeding leftward is visible in the lower left corner, facing left and partly hidden by Ali.  Its head is lowered and its shoulders are hunched.  Its left arm is down but bent up at the elbow and its hand is by its head, perhaps resting on its hair.  It seems to have long hair that falls over its shoulder and appears hanging below its raised forearm.  It wears a long gown.

This bridge seems to cast a shadow on the surface of the water below.  The second bridge emerges from the right edge of the design and curves through the upper right quadrant into the middle.  Its left base is mostly obscured by the foremost bridge.</illusobjdesc>

He faces forward in contrapposto, with his weight shifted largely to his left leg and his right leg bent forward.  His right foot is on tiptoe.  His left arm is down, bent out to the right at the elbow, with his left wrist and hand hidden behind his back.  He raises his slightly bent right arm vertically overhead, brandishing the sword in this hand; its blade angles down to the right over his head.  His head is tilted back and turned slightly to the right, and his eyes are raised.  He has short curly hair.  His bat-like wings are raised vertically behind his back.  He casts a small shadow on the island, between his feet.</illusobjdesc>

The sinner farthest right is a rather muscular nude male, who stands or strides facing left.  His bent right leg is forward and his weight rests on his right foot.  His left leg is extended backwards and may be bent away at the knee so that his lower leg forms an awkward angle and is difficult to see.  Alternatively, his leg may end between the knee and ankle.  He leans forward and raises his right arm roughly vertically.  His right hand is open with the palm facing up.  His head is bent back sharply, so that he can look up at the demon towering above.  His mouth gapes open.  His left arm is extended down and crosses the far side of his right knee; his left elbow may rest against the outside of this leg.  His left hand is open, with the palm facing out.  Tendrils of his short curly hair extend behind his head.</illusobjdesc>

Nude, his torso is rent down the middle, displaying his vital organs.  His arm are raised at 45 degrees and bent towards his torso at the elbow.  With a hand on each side of his gaping laceration, he peels his skin back to show the organs inside.  His viscera spill out of this wound and down past his genitals.  A loop of his intestines circles around his head, over his shoulders; more of his intestines are visible below his right forearm, partially hidden behind his back.  His head is bent and turned slightly to the right.  His mouth is open slightly, showing his upper teeth.  He has long hair and a long beard.  He casts a shadow on the ground to the left of his right foot.

The figure's long curly hair is swept away over its neck and appears below its left elbow.  It wears a long gown with a belt.</illusobjdesc>

His bent right leg is forward; his bent left leg is extended backward with his left knee near the ground and his left foot on tiptoe.  His shoulders are hunched and his head is lowered.  His left arm is extended down by his side.  His left hand is missing, as his arm is truncated above the wrist.  His long hair is swept over his neck.  A lock of it is just visible below his chin.  He may have a thin mustache.  His shadow falls on the ground below his lower left leg and to the left of his right foot.</illusobjdesc>

It is difficult to tell whether this figure is male or female.  Its head is lowered and its shoulders are hunched.  Its left arm is down but bent up at the elbow and its hand is by its head, perhaps resting on its hair.  It seems to have long hair that falls over its shoulder and appears hanging below its raised forearm.  It wears a long gown.

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place in the ninth trench of the eighth circle of hell.  A flat, narrow bank runs across the bottom of the design from corner to corner.  This bank may be bare earth, or may be partly covered with grass or moss.  Deep shadow covers this bank in the lower left corner, or the ground here may be scorched.  Above it a lake stretches the length of the design.  Waves ripple its surface.  The far bank is similarly narrow and flat, and may be covered with similar vegetation.  A small rocky island breaks the surface of the lake near the far bank, midway across the horizontal length of the design.  Flames burn on the surface of the water around the edge of the island in the lake.  A line of flames burns on the near bank of the lake; this line stretches from the left edge of the design across two-thirds of the waterline.  Smoke rises from the lower left corner of the near bank; behind it is a stone, boulder, or the foot of another bridge.  A large stone bridge arches across the design.  It is anchored on the far bank of the lake.  Part of a second bridge is visible above the base of the first bridge, in the upper left corner of the design.  Tall flames rise in a line running the length of the foremost bridge.  More flames appear in front of the second bridge near the left edge of the design.  Wash across the top of the design suggests the sky, dark with what may be smoke or clouds just above the intersection between the two bridges, and lighter elsewhere.  A demon, seen from behind, stands on the island in the lake.  Nude and muscular, he stands in contrapposto with his weight shifted to his right leg and his left leg bent; his left foot is on tiptoe.  His right arm is raised at 135 degrees and bent to the vertical at the elbow.  He grasps the hasp of a large sword with this hand.  His left hand is down and bent.  Large bat-like wings are raised behind his back.  Mosca de' Lamberti, who helped instigate a Florentine war in the thirteenth century, walks rightward in the lower right corner of the design.  He is nude and muscular, and walks with his right leg forward and his left leg extended behind him.  His arms, both of which end abruptly below the elbow, are raised vertically overhead.  Dante and Virgil stand together facing left just to the left of Mosca de' Lamberti.  Dante stands to the left of Virgil and hides his companion slightly.  Both stand with arms down and heads slightly bent.  Dante also turns his head slightly forward, so that his face is visible in three-quarters profile.  The headless Bertrand de Born stands at the left side of the design, facing forward and to the right with his legs spread.  He extends his left arm out horizontally to the right and grasps the long hair of his own severed head with this hand, holding it aloft.  The head's mouth is open, showing its tongue and teeth; it is speaking to Dante, who stands to the right.  Lantern-like, the head also emits beams of light.  Bertrand de Born's right arm is by his side, bent at the elbow.  The fingers on his right hand are spread and he points to his severed head with his right index finger.  He is nude except for a sheer cloak.  Streaks of blood appear on the cloak as well as on de Born's neck, shoulders, arms, pelvic area, and severed head.  The figures of sinners punished in this trench appear in series on the far bank of the lake.  Three of them appear above the boulder or cloud of smoke in the lower left corner of the design.  Three more cower beneath the sword-wielding demon near the center of the design; they are shown stumbling, falling, or kneeling below him.  Two more sinners appear to the left of Mosca de' Lamberti.  Indistinct lines near the right edge of the design, to the right of de' Lamberti, may represent one or two more sinners.

Three of them cower beneath the sword-wielding demon standing on a nearby island.  The rightmost of these kneels on the ground facing right, but turning his head forward and bending it back.  His eyes are raised to look up at the demon above.  He bends forward at the waist.  One bent leg (perhaps his left) is drawn forward, while the other bent leg is extended backwards along the ground.  His slightly bent right arm is raised vertically, up towards the demon.  Only his upper arm is visible of the left arm; it is raised at roughly 45 degrees.  He is wearing a gown and has a beard and long hair.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place in the tenth trench of the eighth circle of hell.  The floor of the trench stretches the length of the bottom of the design, and seems to be bare earth, furrowed in places.  A rock bridge arches down from the upper right corner of the design to the floor of the trench.  A second rock bridge arches from the upper left corner of the design down to the floor of the trench below, near the lower left corner.  Nude human forms are visible in this bridge, petrified in contorted positions.  Most of these forms are difficult to resolve into individuals.  Two additional rock bridges in the distance are visible between the bridges that appear at either side of the design.  Part of another distant rock bridge appears in the lower right corner of the design, to the right of the bridge on which Dante and Virgil stand.  A dark cloud fills the top left corner of the design and extends most of the way across the top edge of the design.  Tongues of flame lick down from beneath the cloud in the upper left corner.  Wash below the cloud and below the bridges suggests the sky.  It is red above and below the two bridges in the distance, perhaps with light from the flames raining down from the cloud, and paler elsewhere.  Undulating lines in the sky in the lower right corner, below the distant bridge, suggest smoke or cloud.  Dante and Virgil stand side-by-side on a small shelf in the stone bridge at the right.  Dante stands to the left of Virgil and obscures his companion slightly.  Both wear long gowns, and bend their arms up at the elbow in front of their torsos, with hands together in front of their faces.  Each may hold his nose.  Three nude &quot;falsifiers,&quot; or forgers, who are now afflicted with disease lie in a huddle in the lower left corner of the design, near the base of the human bridge.  The leftmost of these lies supine with his body partially resting against the sinner behind him, so that his torso faces forward as well as up.  His legs extend to the right and are largely hidden by another sinner, a heavy male.  His bent right arm is extended down along the ground to the left.  His head is tilted back and to the left, so that his right cheek rests on his right shoulder.  The heavy sinner to the right lies or crawls with his belly resting on his right leg, which is bent and drawn up beneath him and lies on the ground.  This sinner's bent left leg is extended to the right and his left foot rests on tiptoe.  He bends backwards and lifts his torso, bending his head back to look left.  His mouth is open and his eyes are lowered or closed.  His left arm is down and his elbow, forearm, and many of the spread fingers of his left hand all rest on the ground.  The head and shoulders of a third sinner appear above the other two.  This figure's gender is difficult to discern.  Its shoulders face forward but it tilts its head back to look up, so that its face is seen from below.  Another group of diseased falsifiers lie together on the trench floor near the bridge on which Dante and Virgil stand.  Two males at the top of the pile sit with their backs together.  They are Griffolino of Arezzo and Capocchio of Siena, both of whom were alchemists.  The rightmost of these faces right and away, and bends to the right slightly.  His right arm is down and bent up at the elbow across his lower back; he raises his right hand and uses his spread fingers to scratch his back.  His left arm is raised and bent down past his head, and he scratches his back between his shoulder blades with the fingers on this hand.  The other seated male faces left.  His left arm is by his side, bent up at the elbow across his back, which he scratches with the spread fingers of his left hand.  He bends forward sharply over his own lap, so that his left upper arm may rest on his thigh.  The forms of the other sinners lumped into the pile are difficult to distinguish, though several heads and upper bodies emerge.  They are forgers.  The pile casts a shadow on the ground beneath.

A clearly distinguished arm extends roughly horizontally near the base of the bridge; it is slightly bent.  Lines above and below may be a torso of the same figure, lying supine.  Lines above this suggest another torso, facing forward with visible breasts.  A horizontal shape above this torso may be a leg, perhaps with a knee or foot.  A head facing forward with closed or lowered eyes is visible above this lower limb.  The shapes above this head are even more indistinct.</illusobjdesc>

He faces forward and slightly left.  His long gown covers his arms and hands, but both arms seem to be bent up at the elbow in front of his torso, with hands together in front of his face.  He may be holding his nose.  He has long hair.</illusobjdesc>

His legs extend to the right and are largely hidden by another sinner, a heavy male, but one lower leg and foot are visible, respectively above and below the heavy sinner's own extended left leg.  His bent right arm is extended down along the ground to the left.  His hand rests on the ground in a loose fist.  His head is tilted back and to the left, so that his right cheek rests on his right shoulder.  His mouth is open, and may show his teeth.  His long hair falls away from his forehead.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>Another group of diseased falsifiers lie together on the trench floor near the bridge on which Dante and Virgil stand.  The forms of most of the nude sinners, who represent forgers, are difficult to distinguish.  At the right of the pile, the upper body of a male lies supine with head back and chin tilted up so far his face looks right.  His eyes are closed.  This figure may have long hair.  Immediately to the left, the upper body of a supine woman extends down from the pile, facing slightly forward as well as up.  Her head is tilted to the left, so that her face is seen in profile looking up.  Her eyes are closed.  Her long hair is spread on the ground around her head.  Her mouth may be open.  Her breasts are visible.  To the left, the upside down head of another sinner hangs down, facing left.  It is difficult to say whether this figure is a male or female, or what sort of hair it may have.  Its shoulders just emerge from the pile.  Its eyes are closed and its mouth may be open.  Other forms between these heads represent additional indistinct figures.  At the left side of pile, a figure's torso lies face down extending to the left.  Wash suggests this single figure may be wearing a shirt or other garment.  It has short hair.  To the left of this figure, a head lies on the ground looking up.  Its long hair is spread on the ground to the left.  Its eyes are closed.  Above these two figures at the left of the pile, a third figure lifts its head to look forward with eyes raised.  It seems to be balding, with short hair at its temples. Its right shoulder is also visible.  </illusobjdesc>

                <illustration location="E" type="plate">
                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place in the tenth trench of the eighth circle of hell.  A rock bridge arches through the middle of the design, rising from the lower left corner and extending to roughly the midpoint of the right edge.  Large flames burn above the rock bridge, filling two-thirds of the upper half of the design.  This fire produces clouds of smoke that permeate the rest of the design above the bridge, particularly the upper right corner, but also the spaces between the flames and below them to the left.  The floor of the trench crosses the bottom of the design and appears to be flat earth.  Tall tongues of fire burn in a line across the floor of the trench, below the bridge.  Wash beneath the rock bridge and above the figures suggests the sky, perhaps lit partly by the flames that burn on the floor of the trench.  A small mound or hill rises from the floor of the trench in the lower right corner of the design.  Dante and Virgil stand together on top of this low hill.  Virgil stands to the left of his companion, and obscures him slightly.  He faces away and may tilt his head back.  Dante, to the right, faces left and slightly away, so that he is seen partly from behind.  He tilts his head back slightly.  Myrrha, who deceived her father into incest, leaps or falls through the flames in the upper left corner of the design.  She has the body of a woman and the head of a dog.  Her torso is horizontal, facing forward and down.  Her bent right leg is extended behind her, while her slightly bent left leg is forward.  Both of her feet are pointed into tiptoe position.  Her arms are similarly spread wide.  She is nude and has visible human breasts.  Gianni Schicchi, who forged a will, is shown at the top of the design running or leaping along the rock bridge facing right.  He has the nude body of man but the head of a dog with long canine ears.  His bent right leg is forward, while his left leg is extended behind him and bent to the vertical at the knee.  He is bent forward at the waist so far that his torso is horizontal, facing down.  Both arms are drawn back and raised at 135 degrees.  He grasps the neck of Capocchio of Siena in his muzzle and drags the alchemist along.  Capocchio's torso faces forward and to the right.  He is bent backward at the waist; his legs extend along the rock bridge to the left.  Capocchio's head is crooked sharply left and down at an awkward angle and his right cheek may touch his right shoulder.  Both arms are by his side, bent up at the elbow with hands raised.  Another sinner is shown tumbling down from the rock bridge.  His body is upside down in front of the bridge and below Myrrha.  He faces away, with his head turned slightly to the left.  Both slightly bent arms are extended past his head, with hands open and palms facing down.  His left leg is bent forward and drawn up beneath him so that his left foot is next to his left buttock.  His right leg is also bent forward but not drawn as deeply in towards his body.  Several sinners afflicted with disease are depicted on the floor of the trench amid the flames beneath the bridge.  One is visible between the arms of the falling sinner.  A nude male, he sits or kneels facing forward and slightly to the left, with his right leg extended down to the left and bent away at the knee.  His bent left leg may be visible below his torso with knee forward.  His right arm is extended down between his knees, with hand open and resting palm down on the ground.  His left arm is visible to the elbow, down by his side.  His head is tilted sharply to the right so that his left temple may rest on his left shoulder.  The head and shoulders of a second sinner beneath the bridge are visible to the left.  This sinner's head is down and twisted to look left, so that his face is seen partly from above.  He seems to be nude and to have short hair, but other features are indistinct and difficult to distinguish.  Just to the left of Virgil, the head and shoulders of a third sinner appear.  This sinner seems to bend his or her head back to look up so sharply that the face is seen from below.  The figure may be nude, but other features are difficult to distinguish, including gender.  A nude male sinner lies on his side beneath the rock bridge, his body visible on either side of Dante and Virgil.  Nude, he rests on a diagonal support so that his head, near the right side of the design, is higher than his feet.  His body faces forward, but he tilts his head back and turns it up so that his face is seen in profile.  Both of his hands are raised and open with fingers spread and vertical palms facing out.  The support on which he rests seems to be another small mound or hill on the floor of the trench, perhaps of earth or stone. </illusobjdesc>

A nude male, he sits or kneels facing forward and slightly to the left, with his right leg extended down to the left and bent away at the knee.  His bent left leg may be visible below his torso with knee forward.  His right arm is extended down between his knees, with his hand open and resting palm down on the ground.  His left arm is visible to the elbow, down by his side.  His head is tilted sharply to the right so that his left temple may rest on his left shoulder.  He may bend forward slightly at the waist.  His mouth is open and his eyes are swiveled down to the right.  He has short curly hair.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This design is set in a pit or large well near the ninth circle of hell.  Enormous boulders frame the scene, one at each edge of the design.  Level ground of earth or stone crosses the bottom of the design, forming the bank or edge of the pit or well that is visible between the boulders above.  Dry, dead vegetation suggestive of moss or lichen covers the boulder at the left and the ground just below it.  This vegetation also seems to form the material filling the pit or well.  It covers the vertical surface visible past the giants on the other side of the pit also.  Heavy, dark clouds cross the top edge of the design and fill the upper right corner.  At least two jagged bolts of lightning snake across the design from these clouds.  Tongues of fire also lick down from the cloud near the upper left corner; alternatively this may be more lightning.  Pelting rain and/or sleet, visible as diagonal lines blowing from upper left to lower right, covers the design.  Wash below the clouds, especially towards the right side of the design, suggests a sky dark with storm.  Five nude male giants stand in identical positions, shoulder-to-shoulder and buried to the waist in the well.  They face away, forming a horizontal line that stretches across the well.  Their arms are extended down by their sides.  All of the giants seem to lower their heads.  Each has long, slightly curly hair that spreads over his shoulders and hangs down between his shoulder blades.  Dante and Virgil are small figures standing together near the middle of the bank of the pit.  Lightly sketched, their individual identities are impossible to distinguish.  They seem to face away.  The figure to the left raises his extended left arm at 135 degrees.  His right arm seems to be by his side and bent up at the elbow with hand raised.  The right arm of the figure to the right is not visible.  This figure's left arm is bent up by his side with hand raised.  The figures' footprints on the bank extend from below their feet diagonally down to the left.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place in the ninth circle of hell.  Sharp rocks cross the top of the design and extend down the left edge.  A brick wall extends from the right edge of the design most of the way across the bottom half of the design.  This wall represents the ruined dungeons of Babylon.  The ground near the bottom of the design seems to be flat earth.  It rises into a small furrowed hill in front of the brick wall.  Wash beneath the stone arch and above the wall suggests the sky.  A brick tower, only partly finished, is visible in the lower left corner of the design.  It represents the Tower of Babel.  A niche at the bottom of the tower faces forward, much like a doorway.  A small figure sits on a throne inside the niche, facing forward.  This figure may be intended to represent Satan, attired like an earthly king.  He has long hair and a beard, and wears a gown and a crown with large spikes.  He holds a scepter in his raised left hand, and an orb in his right hand.  Large bat-like wings rise behind the figure's back.  The large figure of Nimrod kneels in the lower right corner of the design.  He faces forward and right with his bent legs beneath him.  His right arm is down by his side with his right hand resting on the ground and perhaps partly tucked beneath his right shin.  The wrist of this arm is shackled to a chain that winds around his waist and then falls to the ground to the left.  His left arm is also by his side, but bent upward across his chest at the elbow; he holds a horn or trumpet in his left hand.  His head is tilted back and turned to the left slightly.  His eyes are raised and his mouth is open, displaying teeth(?) and tongue.  The text suggests he may be speaking.  He wears a crown and has long, curly hair and a forked beard.  His upper body is nude, but a skirt, cloth, or similar garment seems to cover his thighs.  Dante and Virgil stand together in the lower left corner of the design.  They are sketched indistinctly and are impossible to tell apart.  They may face away and be seen from behind, or they may face right.  Other features and aspects of their posture are difficult to discern.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place in the ninth circle of hell.  Dark, heavy clouds cross the top edge of the design, which is dark with storm.  Rain, snow, and hail saturate the design, pelting down from the clouds diagonally from upper left to lower right.  The bank of a well or pit crosses the length of the bottom of the design.  It is transparent in places.  Dry, dead vegetation suggestive of moss or lichen covers the surface of this bank.  The giant figure of Ephialtes, sometimes considered a titan, fills much of the design.  Punished for his attempt to attack the gods, Ephialtes is here shown immobilized and immersed waist-deep in the bank.  His lower body is indistinctly visible; his legs seem to be bent and drawn up beneath his body, so that he kneels with his knees facing right.  He twists at the waist so that his torso faces forward and even slightly left.  His head is bent and turned to the left, and his eyes have swiveled left, perhaps to look at the tiny figures of Dante and Virgil in the lower left corner of the design.  His left arm is extended down in front of him, with his left hand resting palm down on the outside of his left knee.  He is nude, but a manacle binds his left wrist; a heavy chain attached to this cuff wraps his arm, circles his neck, and winds repeatedly around his torso.  To the right of Ephialtes sits another giant, a nude young male with short curly hair, facing away.  He is visible from the waist up, above the bank.  He bends his head and turns it left, so that his face is visible above the nose in profile from behind.  Both arms are down by his side.  To the left of Ephialtes another giant sits facing forward.  Like the others, he is nude and buried waist-deep beneath the bank.  He is older than the others.  His right arm is down by his side.  His head is lowered and tilted to the right, and his left cheek may rest partly on his left shoulder.  He has long hair and a beard.  Dante and Virgil stand together in the lower left corner of the design.  Their tiny size emphasizes by contrast the enormity of the three giants immersed in the bank.  As both of these tiny figures are largely sketched in pencil, their separate identities are difficult to distinguish.  The figure on the left faces forward but turns his head to the right.  His right arm is by his side and bent across his chest; his left arm may be crossed or folded under the right, or may not be shown.  The figure on the right faces forward and slightly to the right, but turns his head slightly left.  His right arm is bent up across his chest and his right hand is raised. </illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>The giant figure of Ephialtes, sometimes considered a titan, fills much of this design.  Punished for his attempt to attack the gods, Ephialtes is here shown immobilized and immersed waist-deep in a bank.  The bank in which he sits is partly transparent, so that his lower body is indistinctly visible; his legs seem to be bent and drawn up beneath his body, so that he kneels with his knees facing right.  He twists at the waist so that his torso faces forward and even slightly left.  His head is bent and turned to the left, and his eyes have swiveled left, perhaps to look at the tiny figures of Dante and Virgil in the lower left corner of the design.  In accordance with Dante's text, the position of his right shoulder suggests that his right arm has been drawn behind his back.  His left arm is extended down in front of him, with his left hand resting palm down on the outside of his left knee.  He is nude, but a manacle binds his left wrist; a heavy chain attached to this cuff wraps his arm, circles his neck, and winds repeatedly around his torso.  He has short curly hair.  His mouth is open, displaying his teeth.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>Dante and Virgil stand together in the lower left corner of the design.  Their tiny size emphasizes by contrast the enormity of the three giants immersed in the bank.  As both of these tiny figures are largely sketched in pencil, their separate identities are difficult to distinguish.  The figure on the left faces forward but turns his head to the right.  His right arm is by his side and bent across his chest; his left arm may be crossed or folded under the right, or may not be shown.  The shape of this figure's gown indicates that his right leg is bent forward slightly.  The figure on the right faces forward and slightly to the right, but turns his head slightly to the left.  His right arm is bent up across his chest and his right hand is raised.  He wears a long gown as well.  Both figures have long hair.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place in the ninth circle of hell, also called Cocytus.  A rocky cliff rises along the right edge of the design.  A stone ledge in the lower left corner of the design represents the floor of the ninth circle of hell.  A thin cloud forms a semi-circle that extends from the top edge of the design, down the middle of the left edge, and around through the lower half of the design before trailing off near the right edge.  Hail volleys diagonally down from the inside of the cloud near the upper left corner of the design.  Additional pellets of hail appear within the cloud near the top edge of the design.  Tongues of fire burn on either side of the cloud in the upper left corner of the design, and on the lower edge of the cloud where it curves away from the left edge of the design.  Wash surrounding the figures suggests the sky, perhaps with distant clouds.  These clouds are especially apparent below the semi-circular cloud.  Flames burn in these distant clouds.  The giant Antaeus, a son of Neptune (and in part a titan) whose superior strength depended on his feet remaining on the ground, fills much of the design.  His nude, muscular body is largely horizontal; he bends backwards and twists at the waist so that his pelvis and thighs are turned slightly up while his torso is turned slightly down.  His knees are bent and his feet rest on tiptoe on separate ledges in the cliff at the right side of the design.  His head is turned down slightly, so that his face is seen in three-quarters profile.  His left arm is extended at 135 degrees and he holds a knob in the cliff with his left hand, palm down.  He reaches his right arm down with his hand open, vertical palm facing forward.  He is depositing Dante and Virgil on the floor of Cocytus with this hand.  Dante's body faces forward and slightly to the left, hanging from Antaeus' hand.  His feet dangle in tiptoe position.  He grasps the giant's hand with both arms: his right arm is raised vertically and his right hand rests on Antaeus' wrist with the palm facing down, while his left hand rests palm down on the outside of Antaeus' palm.  He bends and tilts his head to the left, perhaps to look at Virgil, who stands to the left.  Virgil faces right and reaches out both arms at about 45 degrees to either side of Dante.  Virgil's right hand may rest on Dante's left hip.  </illusobjdesc>

Dante's body faces forward and slightly to the left, hanging from Antaeus' right hand.  His feet dangle in tiptoe position.  He grasps the giant's hand with both arms: his right arm is raised vertically and his right hand rests on Antaeus' wrist with the palm facing down, while his left hand rests palm down on the outside of Antaeus' palm.  He bends and tilts his head to the left, perhaps to look at Virgil to the left.  His mouth is open.  He wears a long gown and has long hair.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place in hell, on a frozen lake that stretches across the bottom of the design.  The surface of this lake is suspended in frozen ripples across the bottom of the design, and in larger waves above the sinners who appear in the scene.  Wash in the top half of the design suggests the sky, perhaps with clouds.  It is dark to the right, and lighter at the left.  Dante and Virgil stand together near the left edge of the design.  Dante stands facing away to the right of Virgil, obscuring him slightly.  He bends to the right at the waist.  His right arm is by his side but bent up at the elbow; he raises his open right hand and holds it with the vertical palm facing away.  Virgil, to the left, faces forward but turns his head to the right.  His right arm is down by his side; this hand is open with the palm facing down.  The sinners punished here are traitors of various stripes.  One lies supine just to the left of Virgil.  The figure's head extends out toward the viewer, bent backwards so that it faces forward and up but is seen upside down.  Its body extends away and its legs may be bent up.  Its head seems to be partly submerged in the ice of the frozen lake.  The face of another sinner, seen in profile looking up, partially emerges from the surface of the frozen lake just above the bottom edge of the design.  Two sinners sit on the ice, positioned shoulder-to-shoulder at the right side of the design.  They are Alessandro and Napoleone degli Alberti, brothers who murdered each other.  The rightmost brother sits facing forward and right, bending forward slightly. His left arm is down by his side, while his right arm is hidden behind his brother.  He bends his head back sharply: his long curly hair and beard are tangled with the hair of his brother, to the left; their hair is frozen together.  The leftmost brother sits facing left and away; bending or leaning backwards slightly, he twists at the waist so that his torso in particular is seen from behind.  His right arm is down and drawn back slightly, and he may brace his weight on his right hand, which seems to rest on the ice behind him with the palm down.  His left arm is down and drawn away across his lap.  His head is bent back sharply and his short hair is frozen in tangles with his brother's hair.  This brother also has a short beard.  To the right of the rightmost brother, another sinner lies supine on the ice with his head out towards the viewer and his lower body extending away.  His knees are bent up.  His head is tilted back so that his face looks forward, seen upside down.  His figure is sketched lightly, making other features difficult to distinguish, but his right arm seems to be raised and bent over his torso; his right lower arm and hand may rest on his raised thighs.  Just to the right of Dante, the head and right shoulder of one sinner barely emerge from the frozen surface, facing up and seen from above.  This sinner's eyes are down or closed.  Just to the right of Dante's knee, the head of another sinner is visible looking forward and slightly left.  A scarf or hood wraps this sinner's head, and a larger hat may surmount this covering.  He may be a priest.  To the right of Dante a sinner dressed like a knight is visible from the waist up looking forward.  His head is tilted to the left so that his right cheek rests on his right shoulder.  His right arm is down and bent forward at the elbow.  His grasps the handle of a sword with this hand; the sword lies along the surface of the ice to the right.  His right elbow may rest on the shoulder of the sinner to the left.  He is wearing a cloak that drapes his shoulders over a full suit of armor, including a breastplate.  He is also wearing a helmet.  Above the leg of the leftmost Alberti brother, the upper body of a sinner wearing the garb of a monk faces forward.  This figure is visible from the chest up, above the ice.  He wears a monk's cowl with the hood drawn around his face.  His eyes are lowered and frozen tears stand on his face.  The face of another sinner appears just to the left of the leftmost Alberti brother's left shoulder.  This sinner wears a faintly sketched crown, like a king.  He faces forward with eyes lowered slightly.  To the left of the monk, the head of a sinner wearing a crown appears.  This figure looks forward with mouth open slightly.</illusobjdesc>

The long gown he wears is transparent, so that his legs are visible through its folds.  His right leg is bent forward slightly at the knee.  His long curly hair falls down his back.</illusobjdesc>

His knees are bent up.  His head is tilted back so that his face looks forward, seen upside down.  His figure is sketched lightly, making other features difficult to distinguish, but his right arm seems to be raised and bent over his torso; his right lower arm and hand may rest on his raised thighs.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place in the ninth circle of hell, on a frozen lake that stretches across the bottom of the design.  The base of a rock bridge is visible at the right side of the design, rising from the surface of the frozen lake to the upper right corner of the design.  Petrified or frozen nude human forms appear in the bridge.  Wash to the left of the rock bridge at the right edge of the design suggests a dark sky, perhaps with clouds, which grows lighter as it approaches the left edge of the design.  A rock or low mound is visible at the left edge of the design, near the lower left corner.  This may be stone or frozen ice.  An upside down face may appear in the mound, looking forward.  Shadow covers the surface of the lake in the distance to the right of this mound.  There are slight indications of another hill, or the foot of a rock bridge, just above the low mound.  Dante stands on the ice at the left side of the design, facing forward and slightly to the right.  He tilts his head to the right and bends it down.  His left arm is down by his side, and he holds his left hand very slightly forward, with his vertical palm facing out.  His right arm is down and bent forward at the elbow; his open right hand is raised with the vertical palm facing out.  Virgil stands to the right of Dante, who hides him slightly.  Virgil faces forward and slightly to the right.  He bends his head and tilts it to the right.  His left arm is bent up at the torso, and his left hand rests palm down on his shoulder.  He may rest his cheek on this hand gently.  The head and shoulders of Bocca degli Abbati, a traitor to his hometown of Florence, rise above the surface of the frozen lake in the lower left corner of the design.  He faces forward, but turns his head up and slightly to the left, tilting it back as well; he may be looking towards Dante, above.  His mouth is open, displaying his teeth, and his eyes are wide.  His open hands are raised above the ice.  The faces of frozen traitors punished in this circle of hell emerge from the surface of the lake.  One appears in profile looking up in the lower right corner of the design.  A slight convexity to the left may be this figure's torso.  To the left of this torso, another face seen in profile looks up.  One appears in the distance to the right of Virgil, looking forward and slightly up.  This figure's eyes are closed or lowered.  Other shapes surrounding this head may be other heads, but their features are impossible to distinguish.  Another head, looking forward with closed eyes, is visible on the surface of the lake to the right of this grouping.  Other indistinct shapes on the surface of the lake may be body parts of additional figures, or may be frozen ripples.</illusobjdesc>

One face appears upside down and looking forward near the surface of the lake, just to the left of the right edge of the design.  A second upside down face looking forward and up is visible to the left of the first.  A nude body with legs together extends upward from this second face.  The figure seems to bend forward at the waist and its arms may be extended out horizontally from the shoulders, resting on the surface of the frozen lake.  A third figure may huddle facing forward just to the left of the second figure's torso.  This figure's knees seem to be bent and drawn up.  It may rest its hands on its knees.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place in the ninth circle of hell.  A frozen lake stretches across the bottom of the design.  Wash above the frozen lake suggests the sky, perhaps with clouds particularly in the upper right corner of the design.  A cave rests on the ice of the frozen lake at the left side of the design.  Irregular lines on the outside of the cave suggest that it too is frozen.  Shadow fills the opening above the figures inside the cave.  Dante stands near the middle of the design, braced as he wrenches the hair of Bocca degli Abati, who is immersed in the lake below.  Dante faces away and to the left, with his bent left leg drawn forward and his slightly bent right leg extended backward.  His right arm is extended at 45 degrees and he grasps Bocca's hair with this hand.  Dante's body leans forward and to the left with his effort.  His long curly hair spills down over his left shoulder.  A transparent gown sweeps over his legs to the ground, its folds suggesting the force of Dante's motion.  Virgil stands to the left of Dante, facing away and to the right.  He is seen partly from behind, though he turns his head to display his face in profile, perhaps because he is watching Dante.  His right arm is by his side, bent away at the elbow across his chest.  Bocca degli Abati, who betrayed his own army in battle, is immersed in the frozen lake up to his mid-torso.  Only his head, shoulders, and the top of his chest are visible in the lower right corner of the design.  Dante's right hand is grasping Bocca's hair, which seems to be relatively long; Dante's force has yanked the traitor's head back.  Bocca's face is thus seen in profile, looking up and slightly right.  His mouth is open wide, and the text suggests he is speaking or screaming (&quot;barking&quot; in some translations) in pain.  The veins of his neck stand out with the effort.  To the right of Bocca degli Abati, Buoso da Duero of Cremona is also submerged in the frozen lake, as punishment for betraying the army he commanded.  He is visible above the mid-torso, facing forward.  His head is bent back and turned to the left.  His eyes are raised, perhaps to look at Dante, and his mouth is open, showing his teeth and perhaps his tongue.  The upper body of Archbishop Ruggieri degli Ubaldini of Pisa is visible huddled inside the cave at the left side of the design.  During his life Ruggieri betrayed Count Ugolino della Gherardesca, who himself betrayed his relatives; Ugolino is here shown attacking the archbishop.  Ruggieri faces left and leans heavily on his left arm, which is extended down to the left.  His left hand is braced on the surface of the lake, palm down.  Ruggieri's head is lowered, and a lock of his long curly hair hangs down past his forehead.  Blood stains his hair above his shoulder.  His abandoned crosier rests on the ground below the opening of the cave.  Ugolino's head and left shoulder are shown resting on Ruggieri's bent back, facing left and down.  Ugolino bends over and leans against the archbishop in the act of biting Ruggieri's head.  Ugolino's mouth is open, displaying his teeth prominently.  Drops of blood drip from Ugolino's mouth.</illusobjdesc>

A transparent gown sweeps over his legs to the ground, its folds suggesting the force of Dante's motion.</illusobjdesc>

Only his head, shoulders, and the top of his chest are visible in the lower right corner of the design.  His shoulders face forward, but he leans to the right slightly.  The upper portion of his left arm is down by his side; his right arm and lower left arm are not visible.  Dante's right hand is grasping Bocca's hair, which seems to be relatively long; Dante's force has yanked the traitor's head back.  Bocca's face is thus seen in profile, looking up and slightly right.  His mouth is open wide, and the text suggests he is speaking or screaming (&quot;barking&quot; in some translations) in pain.  The veins of his neck stand out with the effort.  He is nude. </illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place on a frozen lake in the ninth circle of hell.  The mound of a cave extends three-quarters of the way across the design from the left edge.  Shadows appear in its opening around the figures who crouch inside.  Irregular lines on the surface of the cave's mound suggest that it too is frozen.  Similar lines appear on the ground of the cave's mouth, and cross through the figures who huddle there.  Wash at the top of the design above the cave suggests the sky.  It may be streaked with clouds, particularly in the upper left corner.  Dante stands to the right of the cave's mouth, facing left.  His head is lowered and turned forward, so that his face is seen in three-quarters profile.  His arms are crossed over his chest, and both hands rest on his breastbone, left over right.  He may rest his chin on his hands.  Virgil stands to the right of Dante, who hides him slightly.  Virgil faces away and to the left, so that he is seen partly from behind.  His head is lowered, but his face is mostly hidden.  Archbishop Ruggieri degli Ubaldini kneels at the mouth of the cave in the lower left corner of the design.  He faces left, but hunches over with drooped shoulders; his head hangs and he looks down.  His left leg is bent and drawn up beneath him.  His left arm is extended down and his left hand seems to rest on the ground, tucked beneath his left shin.  His ecclesiastical gown has been wrenched down and now circles his torso and upper arm loosely; his shoulder is nude.  Red tinting indicates blood on his gown.  His long curly hair hangs in strings and blood drips thickly from his neck.  The archbishop's crosier, or staff, rests abandoned on the ice near the lower edge of the design.  His hat, another potent symbol of his office, sits on the cave near his head; it is also bloody.  It has a wide brim and a long tassel.  Count Ugolino della Gherardesca kneels to the right of Ruggieri, whose body obscures him slightly.  Ugolino faces forward.  His left leg is bent beneath him.  He tilts his head to the right and bends it down slightly.  His eyes are raised and his mouth is open, revealing his teeth and perhaps tongue.  The text indicates that he is speaking, telling his story to Dante and Virgil.  Both of his forearms are bent up on either side of his torso; his open hands are raised with the vertical palms facing forward.  Sketched lines near the ground to the right of Dante and Virgil suggest the indistinct pictures of several additional sinners punished as traitors in this trench.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>Dante stands to the right of the cave's mouth, facing left.  His head is lowered and turned forward, so that his face is seen in three-quarters profile.  His eyes seem to look up.  His left arm is by his side, bent up across his chest.  His lower right arm is bent up across his chest from the far side of his body, and both hands rest on his breastbone, left over right.  He may rest his chin on his hands.  He has long curly hair, and wears a long transparent gown, below which his left foot is visible.</illusobjdesc>

His ecclesiastical gown has been wrenched down and now circles his torso and upper arm loosely; his shoulder is nude.  Red tinting indicate blood on his gown.  His long curly hair hangs in strings and blood drips thickly from his neck.  His tongue is visible in his open mouth.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene is set in the cell where Count Ugolino della Gherardesca was imprisoned with his sons and grandsons.  The design is only sketched in pencil, but lines to the left and right of Ugolino, who sits at the center, indicate the shape of the bare room, perhaps of stone, that became their tomb.  A small square window(?) is visible above Ugolino's head.  Count Ugolino sits facing forward with his legs bent up together before him.  His arms are raised at 45 degrees and his arms and hands rest on the figures of his grandsons, Anselmuccio and Nino il Brigata, who sit at his sides.  The grandson on the left sits with his knees drawn up before him.  He leans to the right, against his grandfather.  His head is bent back slightly, turned to the right, and tilted to the left.  His mouth may be open.  The grandson on the right sits with his knees drawn up in front of his chest.  His left arm may be down by his legs, with his left hand resting on his left ankle.  His head is bent and turned left slightly.  Two angels fly or hover over Ugolino and his grandsons.  The angel on the left faces right and down, with his(?) body extended down to the left.  He may also be turned away, so that his head and body are seen from behind.  The angel on the right faces left and down, but her(?) body is also turned slightly forward.  Her arms are by her side but bent up across her chest, with her right arm folded over the left.  Both angels wear long gowns and have large wings folded behind their backs.  Ugolino's adult sons, Gaddo and Ugoccione, sit in the lower corners of the design.  The son on the left sits facing right and slightly forward with his bent legs extended together out to the right.  His slightly bent arms are down by his side and both hands rest on the floor, palms down.  His head is bent back and his mouth is open; his teeth and tongue are visible.  The son on the right sits facing left with his legs extended together along the floor.  He may rest his back against a wall of the cell.  His left arm is down by his side and his left hand rests on the floor, palm down.  He bends his head and turns it forward slightly; his mouth may be open.</illusobjdesc>

He may also be turned away, so that his head and body are seen from behind.  The position of his arms is difficult to discern, but his right arm seems to be by his side and bent at the elbow.  He wears a long gown and his hair is drawn back into a bun near the nape of her neck, although curly strands frame his face.  His large wings are folded behind his back.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place in the center of the earth, which is also the center of hell.  The enormous figure of Lucifer stretches from top to bottom of this design.  Facing forward, he is immersed to the waist in ice, which is opaque in areas and transparent in other areas.  The smaller figures of sinners are frozen within the ice.  The top half of the design is dark around the figure of Lucifer, except along the top edge above Lucifer's three heads.  Of these heads, only the middle looks forward.  The heads to left and right are bent down slightly, and look left and right respectively.  His arms are by his side, bent up and away from his body at the elbows.  His legs are bent and extend diagonally down to the right with his feet seemingly on tiptoe.  He is nude.  All three of his heads have beards and short curly hair; each wears a crown.  The middle head, which is also the head most clearly delineated, holds the tiny figure of Judas Iscariot clamped in the teeth of its open mouth.  Only Judas' lower body is visible: his legs dangle, slightly bent, from Lucifer's large mouth.  Lucifer's two bat-like wings are spread wide on either side of his body.  Four giant forms are visible frozen beneath the ice in the bottom half of the design.  They represent traitors.  The head of one lies near the right edge of the design, not far from the lower right corner.  He alone of the four giants appears young and clean-shaven.  His face looks forward and his eyes are closed.  His body stretches horizontally leftward across the design.  His legs lie side-by-side; a serpent has wound itself around them.  The reptile's head hangs down with mouth open and teeth showing.  To the left of the serpent, a small male figure clings to the giant's lower legs.  This figure hangs facing up with his torso horizontal and his arms and legs raised vertically and encircling the giant's legs.  His head is turned slightly forward, so that his face is visible in three-quarters profile, upside down and looking up.  The head and shoulders of a second small figure are visible above and to the left of the head of the first, looking forward.  This figure seems to be a male with short hair, holding its mouth open.  The head of one of the other, older giants lies facing up just above the bottom edge of the design.  He has long hair and a long beard, both of which meld into the ice.  His eyes are closed.  He wears a crown.  The head of a third giant is visible lying to the right of Lucifer's left hip.  This head is tilted back so that it is seen upside down, facing forward and to the right.  He wears a crown and has long hair and a long beard.  His eyes are closed.  His supine body extends down to the left and seems to merge with the ice.  A fourth giant is visible lying to the left of Lucifer's right thigh.  He faces forward and up, with closed eyes.  His body extends horizontally to the right and seems to merge with the ice.  He has long hair and a beard, and wears a crown.  Just below this giant's head, the upper body of a much smaller figure is visible.  This figure seems to be male.  His left arm is bent, with his hand down; his right arm is wrapped around his head.  He faces forward with head lowered.  He kneels on his right leg; his left leg is bent sharply at the knee.  Above the giant's head sits a much smaller male, facing left and bending over with lowered head.  He sits within a kind of cave in the ice.  His slightly bent left arm reaches down below his left leg, which is bent and drawn up to his chest.  He may lean on his thigh and rest his chin on his knee.  He seems to have long hair, and may be nude.  Flames rise around him inside the cave.  Shadows fill the spaces between the flames inside the cave.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Dante, Virgil, and Cato stand together on the shore at the base of the mountain of Purgatory.  The shore runs across the bottom of the design.  The mountain of Purgatory forms a wall that is visible at the left edge of the design, extending from the lower left corner.  Four stars glitter in the sky above the figures' heads.  Virgil stands at the left side of the grouping of three figures.  He faces left and away, and is seen mostly from behind.  His bent left leg is extended behind him, with his left foot on tiptoe.  He bends and twists to the right at the waist, and turns his head right so that his face is seen in profile.  His slightly bent right arm is down and he points at the ground with his right index finger.  His left arm is raised vertically, with the hand opened and vertical palm facing away.  Dante stands to the right of Virgil at the bottom of the design.  He faces forward and bends to the right slightly.  His head is bent slightly, and turned and tilted to the right slightly.  His arms are by his side, bent forward at the elbows with both of his open hands raised.  His vertical palms face forward.  His long curly hair cascades over his shoulders.  Of the three figures, Cato stands nearest the right edge of the design.  He faces forward and to the left.  His right arm is extended and raised at 45 degrees.  He points to the ground with his right index finger.  His left arm is by his side, bent up at the elbow across the chest with his open left hand raised, vertical palm facing in towards the body.  Cato has long hair and a long beard.  A cloud surrounds his figure from head to foot.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Dante and Virgil kneel on the sandy shore at the base of the mountain of Purgatory.  The shore runs across the bottom of the design.  The mountain of Purgatory forms a wall that is visible at the left edge of the design, extending from the lower left corner.  The sea stretches across the design, above the shore, from the right edge of the design to the mountain of Purgatory on the left.  Small waves ripple its surface.  Shadows appear near the horizon, particularly towards the left side of the design.  A row of reedy rushes with small leaves lines the shore behind the figures of Dante and Virgil.  Wash in the top half of the design indicates the sky.  The sun peeks over the horizon near the right edge of the design, sending long beams through the sky in the upper half of the design and over the water below.  A large cloud stretches across the top of the design and arches from the middle of the top edge down to the left to meet the sea at the horizon line.  This cloud may cast the shadows visible on the water.  It is especially heavy and dark nearer the upper right corner of the design.  Dante rests on hands and knees at the bottom of the design, facing right.  Both of his arms are slightly bent.  His hands rest palm down on the bank.  He looks down.  Virgil rests on his knees facing left, just to the right of Dante, twisting slightly at the waist so that his upper body faces partly forward.  He is tying a rush around Dante's head.  Virgil's left arm is by his side, bent forward at the elbow.  He holds one end of the rush with the fingers of his left hand, which is near Dante's forehead.  His right arm is by his side but bent upward; his right hand is raised to chest-level, over Dante's head, and he holds another end of the rush with this hand.  His head is bent and turned forward, and his mouth may be open slightly.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place on the shore below the mountain of Purgatory.  The sandy shore stretches across the bottom of the design.  The mountain of Purgatory forms a wall or cliff that is visible at the left edge of the design, extending up from the lower left corner.  The mouth of a cave opens in the base of the wall or cliff, in the lower left corner of the design.  A table supporting a lit candle and an altar -- perhaps a diptych -- is visible through the mouth of the cave.  The sea extends across the design, above the shore, from the right edge of the design to the mountain of Purgatory on the left.  Small waves ripple its surface.  Wash in the top half of the design, above the sea, suggests the sky.  It is darkest in the upper left corner.  A crescent-shaped boat, reminiscent of a waxing or waning moon, rests lightly in the sea near the middle of the right edge of the design.  A bright angel stands in the boat with his large wings spread wide.  He seems to face away.  His arms are raised at 45 degrees on either side of his body.  His long hair flies around his head and the skirts of his gown sweep leftward as if in a wind.  Light beams from his body and brightens the sky around him.  Cato stands in the lower left corner of the design, partially hiding the entrance to the cave.  He faces right.  His right arm is bent across his chest.  His arms may be folded and his left hand may be visible on his right elbow.  A group of spirits destined for Purgatory stand on the shore below the mountain, having just arrived on the boat that is now some distance from the shore.  At the far left of the group an indistinctly drawn figure stands looking forward.  This figure is just visible between the mountain and another figure to the right, who stands facing away and wearing a long gown.  This figure may be male or female.  Both arms are down by its side and bent forward, up, and out at the elbows.  The figure's hands are raised and may be open with palms facing up.  Third from left, a figure stands facing forward with right leg forward and left leg extended backward.  This figure's left foot may be on tiptoe.  His or her arms are raised overhead at 135 degrees, bent to the vertical at the elbows.  The figure's head is tilted to the right.  Fourth from left, a figure stands facing forward, tilting his or her head back and turning it left.  This figure's arms are down and bent across his or her chest.  The figure's hands are slightly raised, with palms together.  Fifth from left, one stands facing right and possibly turning his or her head away.  This figure's right arm may be bent across his or her torso.   Faint lines to the right of this figure suggest a sixth standing figure.  Other features of this sixth figure are impossible to discern.  Dante and Casella face one another and embrace at the right side of the group.  Their indistinct features make their identities difficult to specify.  The figure on the left faces right and clasps his friend with bent right arm raised and his lower right arm and hand resting on the other figure's left shoulder.  The shape of the long gown he wears suggests that his right leg is extended backwards.  The figure on the right faces left and returns the embrace with his left arm wrapped around the first figure's torso.  He wears a long gown as well, and seems to extend his left leg backward.  The head of the figure on the right may rest on the right shoulder of the figure on the left.  To the right of the group of spirits, and a short distance from them, Virgil stands facing left.  He wears a long gown and seems to have long hair.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place on the side of the mountain of Purgatory, which rises precipitously through the left side of the design.  A craggy path winds up the side of the mountain, extending from the bottom edge of the design into the upper left corner.  The sea is visible between the right edge of the design and the mountain on the left.  Light and shadow mottle its surface, indicating small rippling waves.  An extended patch of light from the sun shines on the water near the horizon, just to the right of the mountain.  Wash above the sea and to the right of the mountain indicates the sky.  The sun burns in the sky above the waters of the sea.  It emits beams of light that brighten the sky around it.  A dark cloud or clouds float in the sky and partially hide the sun.  Dante and Virgil are shown as they climb the path up the mountain of Purgatory.  Dante stands facing away in the lower left corner of the design.  He bends to the left at the waist slightly.  His bent right arm is raised vertically and his right hand rests palm down on an outcropping of rock at the side of the path.  His lower right arm may rest against the rock as well.  His left arm is down by his side and bent away at the elbow, and his left hand lies palm down on the path.  His left leg seems to be bent and drawn up, resting on a rock to help support his weight; the bottom of his left foot faces out towards the viewer.  Virgil stands above, facing forward on the path near the upper left corner of the design.  He bends his head and turns it slightly to the right; his mouth is slightly open and his eyes seem to be lowered, perhaps to look at Dante below.  His right leg is bent and drawn up, and his right foot rests on tiptoe on a rock in the path.  His left leg is down.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>Dante and Virgil are shown as they climb the path up the mountain of Purgatory.  Dante stands facing away in the lower left corner of the design.  He bends to the left at the waist slightly.  His bent right arm is raised vertically and his right hand rests palm down on an outcropping of a rock at the side of the path.  His lower right arm may rest against the rock as well.  His left arm is down by his side and bent away at the elbow, and his left hand lies palm down on the path.  His left leg seems to be bent and drawn up, resting on a rock to help support his weight; the bottom of his left foot faces out towards the viewer.  His bent right leg is down and his right foot is on tiptoe.  He wears a transparent gown and has long curly hair.  He casts a small shadow on the path below his right foot, and a larger one on the rock to the right, beside the path.</illusobjdesc>

Virgil stands facing forward on the path, near the upper left corner of the design.  He bends his head and turns it slightly to the right; his mouth is slightly open and his eyes seem to be lowered, perhaps to look at Dante below.  His right leg is bent and drawn up, and his right foot rests on tiptoe on a rock in the path.  His left leg is down.  His right arm is raised almost vertically and his right hand grasps a rock above Virgil's head.  His left arm is down and rests against his side.  He has long curly hair and wears a transparent gown.</illusobjdesc>

The mountain itself continues up the left side of the design, though it is here only sketched lightly in pencil.  Several boulders lie tumbled where the base of the wall meets the ledge.  The horizontal surface of the ledge is covered with grass or moss.  A rock path cut into the cliff is just visible at the lower left edge of the design.  A sliver of sea appears at the right side of the design, visible between the right edge and the cliff.  Its surface ripples with small waves.  Wash above the sea and the ledge suggests the sky.  Clouds cross the top edge of the design and trail down towards the ledge itself.  A smaller cloud or misty puff of vapor is visible just beyond the edge of the ledge.  Dante and Virgil sit together on the ledge at the base of the mountain wall, to the left of the tumbled boulders.  Both figures, which are impossible to tell apart, sit facing forward with their knees drawn up to their chests.  The figure on the left holds his right arm out at 45 degrees.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place on the mountain of Purgatory, which fills the right edge of the design.  A narrow rocky ledge clings to the side of the mountain just below the midpoint of its visible section.  A path may run along this ledge.  Below the ledge, the mountain's slope becomes gentler.  The sea is visible between the left edge of the design and mountain on the right.  Wash above the sea and to the left of the mountain suggests the sky.  Virgil stands on the ledge at the right side of the design.  He wears a long transparent gown, which reveals that his legs face left; he twists forward slightly at the waist.  His arms are by his side, bent up and out at the elbows.  His hands are raised with the palms facing forward and up.  Dante stands to the right of Virgil on the same ledge, but faces away and to the right.  His right leg is slightly forward, while his left is extended backwards and his left foot is on tiptoe.  He bends his head back and raises both arms vertically overhead.  His hands are open; the right palm faces up and the left seems to face away.  A cloud rises from the lower right corner and loops counter-clockwise through the design.  It begins to dissipate as it crosses the top of the design, and soon separates into three smaller columns that trail towards the lower left corner.  Spirits of those who failed to repent until near death fly within the cloud, beginning in the upper right corner.  The first spirits are only faintly visible; they become increasingly clear as the column or cloud of vapor circles left and down.  The first two spirits, near the upper right corner of the design, fly with horizontal bodies facing down and heads bent back to look left.  They are penciled very lightly.  Third from right appears the first spirit who is more clearly delineated, facing forward with her body nearly horizontal, her right arm bent up, and her long hair flying around her head.  Fourth from left a spirit flies with his body pointing diagonally downward to the left.  He is more clearly delineated than the spirits nearest the upper right corner.  His head is bent back to look left and down, but his torso faces away; his legs are bent.  He holds the left arm of the figure below.  Below him to the right a quite clearly delineated female spirit flies with her body in a similar diagonal position.  Her torso faces down, but she bends back and twists to the right at the waist, so that her shoulders and breasts face forward.  Her arms are spread wide.  The figure of another clearly defined spirit crosses the horizon line where the cloud nears the left edge of the design.  Her shoulders and breast face partly out towards the viewer, but she bends backwards and twists at the waist so that her pelvis faces up.  Her head is bent back and up to the right, and her arms are spread wide.  Above her another female spirit, drawn lightly in pencil, flies or hovers with her body facing down to the right, but her head bent back to look left.  Her left leg extends up to the right, and her arms are spread wide.  A male spirit in the lower left corner is delineated perhaps most clearly of the entire grouping.  He is upside down and curled rightward, with his bent legs extending up and over to the right, and his torso facing away and up.  His arms are spread wide.  Above him to the right, a clearly drawn female spirit flies or hovers with her torso roughly horizontal.  Her pelvis faces down but her upper body twists to face forward.  Her bent legs are extended up to the left, though they curve around to the right.  Her bent arms are raised to either side of her body.  Third from the lower left corner, another clearly drawn female spirit flies or hovers with her body nearly upright.  Her lower body faces forward, down, and to the right, but she bends backwards and twists sharply away at the waist, so that her shoulders are seen from behind.  She turns her head left and raises her right arm nearly vertically.  Her left arm is drawn back and raised at 45 degrees.  To the right of this spirit, a clearly drawn female spirit flies or hovers nearly upright, with her lower body facing right but her upper body twisted to face forward and left. Both her arms are by her side, bent up at the elbow with open hands raised.  She partly hides the figure of another female spirit whose body faces right and slightly forward.  This spirit raises her left arm vertically and holds her raised left hand open.  She bends backwards at the waist and at least her right leg extends down to the left.  Three more spirits cluster together at the end of the semi-circular column.  A male spirit is visible just below Virgil's feet, facing right and bending his head back to look up at Virgil.  His slightly bent right leg extends backwards with the foot on tiptoe, and his right arm is bent up at the elbow.  To the left of this spirit, a more faintly drawn spirit faces away, with her head tilted back and turned up to the right.  Her legs also extend down to the left.  A male spirit is just visible between this female spirit and one fifth from the lower left corner.  This male faces right and raises his eyes, perhaps to look at Virgil above.  His right arm is down and bent across his chest, while his legs extend behind him to the left.</illusobjdesc>

Her shoulders and visible breasts face partly out towards the viewer, but she bends backwards and twists at the waist so that her pelvis faces up.  Her slightly bent right leg extends up to the right.  Her left leg, visible only to the knee, is next to the right.  Her head is bent back and turned up to the right slightly; her eyes are raised and her mouth may be open.  Her arms are spread wide: she reaches her right arm down to the left at 45 degrees and raises her left arm up at 135 degrees.  Her lower left arm rests along the forearm of the spirit above her; she holds his forearm near the elbow with her left hand.  Her long curly hair blows up to the right.  She seems to wear a transparent gown or loosely fitted garment that sweeps over her right arm, billows behind her shoulders, and trails past her feet.</illusobjdesc>

Spirits of those who failed to repent until near death fly within the cloud, beginning in the upper right corner.  Two spirits at the end of the semi-circular column fly or hover just below Virgil's feet.  Just to the left of leftmost of these, a third spirit is partly visible, drawn lightly in pencil.  He faces right and raises his eyes, perhaps to look at Virgil above.  His right arm is down and bent across his chest.  He bends backwards at the waist and extends at least his right leg down behind him to the left.  His right foot is pointed into tiptoe position.  He has a curly beard and may have long hair.  He seems to wear a gown.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place in a dell on the side of the mountain of Purgatory.  The base or floor of the dell runs horizontally across most of the length of the bottom of the design, and seems to be covered with grass or indeterminate small leafy vegetation.  A mountain range appears above the dell and extends horizontally from one side of the design to the other.  A path leads through the vegetation at the far side of the dell.  It begins near the right edge of the design, and slants diagonally down to the left to meet the grass in the hollow.  Trees grow on the far side of the hollow.  Their trunks rise in an irregular line above the group of figures seated beneath their foliage, which ranges from tiny leaves to large flower-like leaves.  One tree just to the left of center also bears small round berries, buds, or nuts.  A bare path leads into the dell from the bottom edge of the design.  Three short trees grow in the lower right corner of the design, to the right of the path.  Their tiny trunks branch into limbs that support a leafy canopy.  Other indeterminate leafy vegetation fills the space of the corner.  At least four short trees grow in the lower left corner of the design, to the left of the path.  Like those on the right side, their tiny trunks lift branches that support thickly leaved canopies.  Flowers, perhaps anemones, bloom to the left of the path.  Other indeterminate leafy vegetation fills the spaces of the lower left corner.  Mixed leafy vegetation grows in the roughly triangular space between the right edge of the design, the right side of the path, and the edge of the dell.  Palm fronds are visible right at the edge of the path.  Dante and Virgil stand or walk near the center of the bottom edge of the design, on the path that leads into the dell.  Dante, on the right, faces away and left.  His left leg is bent and extended backwards, with his left foot on tiptoe.  His left arm is down and seems to be bent across his chest.  Virgil, on the left, faces away and slightly left.  His left leg is bent and extended backwards, with his left foot on tiptoe.  Sordello, the Mantuan minstrel, hovers just above the ground to the right of Dante.  He faces away and to the left with his legs extended backwards and his feet pointed into tiptoe position.  His left arm is down by his side and bent slightly forward.  His right arm is visible from shoulder to elbow, where it is bent forward.  A scaly snake undulates on the path near the right edge of the design.  Its head is curled up and back over its body, facing right.  Its mouth is open and a forked tongue emerges.  Horns or a crest grows on its head.  Two angels hover or fly in the sky above the scene, crossing the swords they hold in a protective gesture.  The angel on the left faces forward and slightly right.  She bends backwards at the waist, and her legs extend away and to the left.  Her right arm is by her side, bent up at the elbow with her raised right hand open and vertical palm forward.  Her left arm is extended roughly horizontally.  She holds the grip of her downward pointed sword with this hand.  Her wings are spread wide on either side of her body.  A halo of light circles her head.  The angel on the right is seen from behind.  Her upper body faces away and to the right, but she bends backwards and to the right at the waist so that her lower body faces down.  Her legs extend out towards the viewer and curl away to the right.  The soles of both feet are visible.  Her left hand appears just beneath the base of her left wing, holding the grip of her sword, which points down to the left.  Her large wings are spread wide.  Like her counterpart, a halo of light circles her head.  Rivulets of flame run down the blades of the swords the angels hold, ending in wispy sparks at their tips.  A group of twenty or twenty-one spirits sit in a depression beneath the trees at the far side of the dell.  These are spirits who, busy with earthly power during life, put off repentance until near death.  Several wear royal garb; one is dressed in a monk's hood.</illusobjdesc>

He leans backwards, resting his back against the trunk of a tree.  His left arm is by his side, bent up at the elbow with hand raised.  His knee, visible just to the left of Sordello, suggests that his leg is bent.  He has a beard and long curly hair, and may be wearing a gown.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place on the side of the mountain leading to Purgatory.  Several roughly horizontal stony(?) ledges lead up the mountain on the left.  Grass covers much of the side of the mountain, especially on the roughly horizontal surfaces of the ledges.  To the right of the mountain, dark wash fills the design and surrounds the figures.  Especially dark near the upper left corner, it suggests the night sky near dawn.  Nine stars are scattered throughout.  A full, large moon glows near the darkest part of the sky at the top edge of the design, behind the heads of two of the figures.  The rising sun just peeks into the design in the lower right corner.  It sends beams of light across the sky, which is lightest nearby. Four stunted trees grow on a ledge in the lower left corner of the design.  Their leafy canopies seem to merge together above a few visible branches.  Two small trees or stalky flowering plants grow side-by-side on a ledge above these four trees.  The larger of these may have lily-like blooms.  A tree or plant grows up the side of a ledge above and to the right of the four stunted trees in the lower left corner of the design.  From roots to leaves, it seems to merge with or lie right on top of the stone.  To the right of this vegetation, another small tree with large leaves on its branches grows.  Another leaf lies on the ground a little farther down this ledge to the right.  Indeterminate leafy or flowering vegetation grows close to the ground on the left and right of the rightmost tree in the lower left corner.  Similar vegetation grows along the ground to the right of the sparsely leaved tree above and to the right.  Lucia carries Dante up the side of the mountain.  He sleeps in her embrace as she moves lightly upward.  She faces left, though her torso is turned slightly out toward the viewer.  Her left leg is bent and drawn forward and up; the toes of her pointed left foot just touch the grass growing on the mountain rock.  Her right leg is extended behind her, with the foot pointed.  Her bent left arm is down and wrapped around Dante's legs, supporting them, and her left hand is tucked partly behind his knees.  Her right forearm and hand are bent upward and raised behind Dante's shoulders and head, cradling him close.  His head rests on her breast and shoulder beneath her chin, with his face facing forward and right.  His body extends to the right.  His legs are bent.  His right arm is down and bent, resting across his lap.  His eyes are closed.  Lucia's head is bent down towards him and may rest on his head.  The luminous moon forms a halo around their heads.  Virgil is shown near the lower right corner of the design, climbing the mountain after Lucia and Dante.  He faces left though his torso is turned slightly out towards the viewer, and steps forward with his bent right leg.  His bent left leg is extended behind him, and his left foot is on tiptoe.  His left arm is at his side, bent slightly.  His right arm is also down, but bent forward; his right hand rests on his right knee, and both arm and hand may be braced against this leg to support his climb.  He bends his head back and raises his eyes to look at Lucia above.</illusobjdesc>

His head rests on her breast and shoulder beneath her chin, with his face facing forward and right.  His body extends to the right.  His legs are bent.  His right arm is down and bent, resting across his lap.  He wears a long gown.  His eyes are closed.  The luminous moon forms a halo around their heads.</illusobjdesc>

His left arm is at his side, bent slightly.  His left hand is open with the palm down.  His right arm is also down, but bent forward; his right hand rests on his right knee, and both arm and hand may be braced against this leg to support his climb.  He bends his head back and raises his eyes to look at Lucia above.  He may also bend forward slightly.  He has long curly hair, and wears a semi-transparent gown that swirls around his legs.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place before the gateway into Purgatory, at the top of the mountain.  The mountain is visible at the bottom of the design, crossing from the lower right edge almost all the way to the lower left edge.  It drops off precipitously near the left edge.  The wall of Purgatory is visible from the top of the mountain through the right side of the design to the upper right corner.  Three steps lead up from the top of the mountain to an arched door or gateway into Purgatory.  The lowest step is white marble, the middle step is burned black, and the highest step is a blood-red stone.  Shadows fill the doorway above the figure seated within it.  A path runs along the outer edge of the mountain to the base of the steps to the gateway into Purgatory.  The sea is visible above and to the left of the mountaintop.  Waves ripple the water, which also reflects light from above.  Wash to the left of the mountain and above the sea indicates the sky at sunrise.  The sun appears low in the sky to the left of the wall of Purgatory.  Though mostly hidden behind dark clouds, it emits beams of light.  A male angel sits within the doorway into Purgatory, facing forward.  His knees are bent and drawn up to his chest.  His arms are down and his hands may rest on the outside of his ankles.  He has long hair and a long beard, though the top of his head may be bald.  His folded wings are spread to either side of his body.  His head emits beams of light.  Dante and Virgil stand together, facing right, to the left of the steps to the doorway.  Dante is to the left, and hides Virgil slightly.  Dante's head is lowered.  His right arm is down but bent up at the elbow across his torso.  His right hand is raised to just below his head and may touch his face.  His right leg is bent and extended behind him, with his right foot on tiptoe.  Like Dante, Virgil bends his head and holds his right arm down but bent up at the elbow across his torso; his right hand is raised and may touch his face.  Both Dante and Virgil have long hair and wear long gowns.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place at the gateway into Purgatory, on the top of the mountain.  The large arched gateway itself fills much of the design, rising through the right edge.  Three steps lead up to the door of the gateway.  The lowest step is white marble, the middle step is a charred black material, and the highest step is blood-red stone.  The doorway is set into the wall of Purgatory, which rises up the right side of the design and extends two-thirds to three-quarters of the way leftward across the design.  The path leading up the mountain to the gateway is visible across the bottom of the design.  The rocky surface of the mountain top appears between the left edge of the steps to the gateway and the left edge of the design.  A segment of the sea is visible between the left edge of the design and the left edge of the wall of Purgatory.  Waves ripple its surface, which is dappled with shadow and reflected light.  Wash above the horizon line and left of the wall of Purgatory suggests the sky.  Dark clouds lower in the sky near the horizon line, to the left of the wall of Purgatory.  Lighter clouds are visible nearer the upper left corner of the design.  Diagonal lines across the sky in the upper left corner of the design, to the left of the wall of Purgatory, indicate beams of light.  They may stream from the sun hidden behind clouds near the top edge of the design.  Dante kneels in front of the gateway into Purgatory.  He faces right and bends his head back to look up at the angel above.  His right arm is by his side, bent up at the elbow in front of his chest.  His right hand is raised, vertical palm facing away.  Sketched marks to either side of his hand suggest that his left hand is also raised and touches the right in prayer position.  His long curly hair falls behind his back and he wears a long gown.  A male angel stands to the right of Dante, facing left.  He bends his head down and lowers his eyes to look at Dante kneeling before him, and uses the dull point of a sword to write the letters &quot;PPE&quot; for &quot;Peccata&quot; (or &quot;sins&quot;) on Dante's forehead.  The angel's right forearm is raised and he holds the blade of the sword between the thumb and forefinger of this hand, as if the weapon were a giant pencil.  His left arm is by his side but bent up at the elbow, and he holds the sword farther up the blade with his left hand.  His large wings are bent up behind his back, and a penciled semi-circle is visible around his head as if he has a halo or emits beams of light.  Virgil stands to the right of the angel, facing left towards Dante.  His head is bent.  His left arm is by his side and bent across his chest.  His lower right arm likewise crosses his chest, and he rests his crossed wrists against each other, left over right.  Curving lines above these figures may be alternative positions for them.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place on the mountain of Purgatory, which rises through the right side of the design.  A stone path edges the mountain, ascending diagonally from the lower right corner of the design before it curves right around the side of the mountain.  The path runs along a ledge that becomes a steep cliff on the left side.  A dark choppy sea is visible to the left of the mountain.  Wash above the horizon line and to the left of the mountain suggests a dark sky, perhaps heavy with clouds.  Dante and Virgil stand near each other on the ledge.  Dante is left of Virgil.  He faces right and tilts his head back to look at the designs in the cliff to the right.  His right arm is by his side but bent up at the elbow.  Virgil is right of Dante.  His body faces away but he turns his head left.  His left arm is down by his side.  His right arm is by his side but bent up at the elbow.  Both wear long gowns.  A white marble block carved out of the mountain rises like a cliff face on the right side of the ledge.  Relief sculptures show two self-contained scenes carved into the face of the block.  The scene on the right presents the Annunciation, with an angel appearing to the Virgin Mary.  The angel hovers on the left, surrounded in flame, while Mary sits to the left of a desk or table and gazes up at him.  The scene on the left presents the Recovery of the Ark of the Covenant.  The ark itself sits in an ox-cart drawn by two oxen.  Two angels hover over the ark, in positions reminiscent of carvings said to surmount the ark's lid.  King David dances at the head of the procession, beneath a window from which his wife Michal watches.  A crowd has gathered above the oxen.  Meanwhile Uzzah, an Israelite who was punished for touching the Ark of the Covenant, is shown in the instant of punishment at the rear of the procession.  Lightning strikes him in the chest as he bends or falls backwards near the right side of the design.</illusobjdesc>

He holds one side of a harp in his upraised right hand.  His left hand is open with the palm facing up and away.  His left leg is extended behind him with his foot pointed.  His right leg seems to be forward slightly.  His head may be bent back.  He wears a semi-transparent gown that swirls with his movement.</illusobjdesc>

At least four figures representing the crowd are visible as heads and torsos above the oxen that draw the cart bearing the ark.  They face forward and left, and may be wearing gowns.  Additional figures who seem to have been sketched and erased are faintly visible in two additional groups, one above the penciled crowd and the other beneath King David's upraised right arm.  The text suggests that they sing, but Blake's drawing does not convey their features.</illusobjdesc>

The scene on the left presents the Recovery of the Ark of the Covenant.  Uzzah, an Israelite who was punished for touching the Ark of the Covenant, is here shown in the instant of punishment.  He is visible to the right of the wagon bearing the ark.  His lower body faces left and away.  He steps forward with his bent left leg; his bent right leg is extended behind him and his right foot is on tiptoe.  He bends backward sharply at the waist as jagged bolts of lightning strike him in the chest; he may be falling backward.  Wavy lines above and to the left of his pelvis suggest steam rising from sizzling flesh.  His head is bent back so far that his upside down face looks forward and to the right.  His right arm is raised vertically with his open right hand raised, vertical palm facing forward.  His left arm is slightly bent, drawn back behind him and extended down.  His left hand is also open, with the vertical palm facing forward.  His mouth is open, perhaps in a shout of pain.  He is nude and has short curly hair.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place on the mountain of Purgatory, which rises through the left side of the design.  A path leads up the side of the mountain, bending gently left.  Rocky steps cut into the path are periodically visible.  A barrier of rock bounds the path on the right side, and follows the gentle curve it takes.  This barrier separates the path from a precipice on the right.  The mountain bounds the path on the left.  The distant sea is visible to the right of the mountain.  Waves ripple its surface, which also reflects dappled light.  Wash above the horizon line of the sea and to the right of the mountain suggests the sky.  A luminous full moon, but with a crescent within it, hangs low over the water.  Its outer crescent is brightest.  Dante and Virgil stand or walk on the path near the bottom of the section shown in this design.  Virgil is on the right, facing away but turning his head to the left towards Dante.  His slightly bent right arm is raised vertically, and his raised right hand is open with the palm facing left.  His left leg is extended backward with his left foot on tiptoe; the sole of his left foot is partly visible.  Dante is on the left, his body facing away and slightly to the right.  He bends forward at the waist in a crouching posture.  His head, which is also bent back, is turned left; he may look towards a spirit who walks bent low beneath a heavy burden on the left.  Dante holds his right arm out from his side, bent up at the elbow with open hand raised and palm facing out.  His left foot is forward, while his right leg is bent backward and his right foot is on tiptoe.  Four male spirits representing the Proud climb up the path, each figure bent low under an enormous stone that rests upon his back.  The spirit nearest the lower left corner of the design faces right and away, and steps up with his right leg, which is bent forward and drawn up.  His left leg is extended down to the left, and his left foot is on tiptoe.  He bends forward sharply beneath his burden.  His slightly bent right arm is drawn back to support the stone, which he holds with his right hand near the small of his back.  His left hand may be visible above the stone, resting on and stabilizing it.  The spirit second from left faces right and away, but turns his head farther to the right so that his face is seen in three-quarters profile.  He may be looking at Dante, to the right.  The spirit's right leg is bent and extended backwards, with his right foot on tiptoe.  He bends forward sharply at the waist beneath his stone.  His right arm is down and his right hand rests on the ground, perhaps to help support his weight.  His left hand is visible resting on the stone on his back, to stabilize it.  The spirit nearest the upper left corner is penciled lightly, so that some details are difficult to discern.  He faces left and away, and seems to have his left leg bent and drawn up; he kneels on his left shin on a step near the top of the section of path displayed in the design.  His right leg is extended down and off the step to the right; his right foot may be on tiptoe on a lower step.  He leans forward sharply and may also bend forward beneath the heavy stone on his back.  His left arm seems to be extended up to the left and may rest against a higher step.  His right arm is visible below the elbow, bent behind his back over the top of the stone resting there; he stabilizes it with this hand, which rests palm down.  The spirit second from top faces left and away.  Like the other spirits, he carries a stone.  He steps up with his right leg, which is bent forward and drawn up, resting on a step in the path.  His slightly bent left leg is extended backward, and his left foot rests on tiptoe on a lower step.  He bends forward beneath his burden.  His left arm is bent and raised roughly vertically.  His left hand may rest on a higher step or on the stone cliff face at the left side of the path.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>Dante and Virgil stand or walk on the path near the bottom of the section shown in this design.  Dante is on the left, his body facing away and slightly to the right.  He bends forward at the waist in a crouching posture.  His head, which is also bent back, is turned left; Dante may look towards a spirit who walks bent low beneath a heavy burden to the left.  Dante holds his right arm out from his side, bent up at the elbow with open hand raised and palm facing forward.  His left foot is forward, while his right leg is bent backwards and his right foot is on tiptoe.  He wears a long gown and has long curly hair.</illusobjdesc>

His right leg is extended down and off the step to the right, though his right knee may rest on the step.  His right foot may be on tiptoe on a lower step.  He leans forward sharply and may also bend forward beneath the heavy stone on his back.  His left arm seems to be extended up to the left and may rest against a higher step.

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place on the mountain of Purgatory, which fills much of the left side of the design.  A sloping ledge forms a path cut into the mountain.  The ledge slopes upward from the lower left corner of the design and then, midway up the design, turns left around the side of the mountain.  The ledge drops into a cliff on the right side of the path.  The distant sea, dappled with reflected light and rippled with waves, is visible above and to the right of the ledge.  Wash above the horizon line and above and to the right of the mountain suggests the sky, perhaps with clouds.  Beams of light cross the sky from a point near its center.  They emanate from the sun, which is partially eclipsed behind an angel depicted near the top of the design.  Dante and Virgil stand or walk together in the lower left corner of the design, on the path.  Dante stands on the right, facing right and away.  His right leg is bent slightly and extended backwards, and his right foot is on tiptoe.  His right arm is down but bent up at the elbow, and his right hand is raised.  Virgil stands on the left.  His lower body faces away, but he bends backward at the waist and twists his shoulders slightly to the right, towards Dante.  Virgil's right arm is by his side but bent up at the elbow, and his right hand lies on Dante's left shoulder.  His left arm is raised vertically.  His left leg is extended behind him, and his left foot is on tiptoe with the sole visible.  An angel strides forward at the top of the section of path visible in this design, the toes of his left foot just touching the surface of the ledge.  He faces forward and right.  His left leg is bent forward and his left foot is on tiptoe.  His legs are spread wide and his bent right leg is extended behind him.  Bending forward at the waist, he tilts his head back slightly to look before him.  His arms are raised and extended at 135 degrees on either side of his body, and his wings are spread wide just behind them.  The angel's body crosses in front of the sun, so that its rays surround him and may appear to emanate from his wings.  Relief sculpture displaying many different figures covers the surface of the ledge.  One of these figures, a male who may be Nimrod, is shown with his body lying stretched on a tower (of Babel?) made of brick at the right edge of the path.  The body of a snake is coiled around him, pinning him to the tower.  Flames and ash may be visible above his head.  The three heads of Lucifer are visible upside down at the bottom of the design.  The central head, which is bearded and wears a crown, looks forward with mouth open.  The heads to the right and left look right and left respectively.  Lucifer's chest is visible above the heads.  Flames extend past either side of the central head.  A spiral coil in the body of a snake appears above Lucifer's leftmost head, next to his chest.  The body of the snake extends upward and is soon hidden by other figures.  Its undulating tail appears again extending up past Nimrod's head and shoulders, on the left.  Its head may be faintly visible facing down with open mouth just to the left of Lucifer's leftmost head.  A male dressed as a king is visible sitting with his knees drawn up near the top of the section of ledge shown in this design.  He wears a crown and has a beard and long curly hair.  To the right appears the head and torso of a woman dressed as a queen.  She faces forward, but bends her head and turns it left.  She wears a small crown and has long curly hair.  To the right of this female, a mass of sketched lines suggests additional undefined, indistinct figures.  A carved rope runs along the left edge of the path, at the base of the wall cut into the mountain, and then curves to the right to extend over the heads of the crowned male and his female companion.  A fist, unattached to any of the other figures, seems to grip the rope over the female's head.  A crowd of heads is visible to the right of Dante and Virgil. Four fists, which likely belong to members of the crowd, are raised above these clustered heads.  Each fist brandishes a sword.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>Relief sculpture displaying many different figures covers the surface of the ledge.  A carving of a rope runs along the left edge of the path, and then curves to the right to extend over the heads of the king and his female companion.  A fist, unattached to any of the other figures, seems to grip the rope over the head of the king's female companion.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>Relief sculpture displaying many different figures covers the surface of the ledge.  A crowd of heads is visible to the right of Dante and Virgil.  The head to the right of Dante's head looks forward with mouth open and forehead furrowed.  Tufts of hair appear at his temples.  To the right, three faces in an uneven row face forward and right with mouths open and eyes raised.  Irregular lines above each face suggest curly hair.  Teeth are faintly visible in the mouth of the leftmost of these three faces, and perhaps in the mouths of the other two as well.  To the right of these three faces, the eyes and nose of a fifth face appear looking forward and right.  This face is hidden below the nose by a sixth face looking in the same direction, with mouth open.  A seventh face, with its mouth wide, looks forward and right above the fifth.  The indistinct features of an eighth face are visible above and to the right of the seventh.  A ninth face is visible below the first face, also looking forward.  Dante's raised right hand partly hides the mouth and chin of this ninth face.  A tenth face, to the right, looks forward and right with eyes raised and mouth slightly open.  A eleventh and twelfth face look forward and left to the left of the first.  Only the eyes of the twelfth face, farthest left, are clearly visible.  Other sketched lines around this cluster of faces suggest additional indistinct heads.  Another face is visible looking forward with mouth open to the left of Virgil's torso.  Sketched lines above and below suggest additional indistinct faces here, near the edge of the design.  Four fists, each brandishing a sword, are raised above the clustered heads.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene, executed only as a rough pencil sketch, takes place on the mountain of Purgatory, which fills much of the right side of the design.  A ledge forms a path cut into the mountain.  It slopes up from the lower right corner of the design before curving right around the edge of the mountain.  The ledge drops into a cliff on the left side of the path.  A crevice or fissure in the mountain begins just above the path, near where it curves rightward, and rises diagonally up to meet the right edge of the design near the top right corner.  The distant sea is visible to the left of the mountain.  Small waves ripple its surface.  Thin clouds wind through the sky above the horizon line.  Penciled lines indicate beams of light crossing the sky from the upper right edge of the design.  Dante and Virgil stand together on the path, near where it curves around the mountain.  Penciled indistinctly, they are impossible to tell apart.  Both face forward and right, and bend their heads.  A group of sinners representing the Envious stand huddled close to each other on the ledge, against the foot of the rising mountain.  Sketched in pencil, they are difficult to distinguish from one another and their features are impossible to discern.  Some or all may lean against the rock.  Several more may be seated together just to the right of this group.  Like the first group, they are sketched in pencil and their numbers and individual features are impossible to distinguish from each other.  All of the Envious may be blind, as in the text.  One of their number has moved closer to Virgil and Dante.  This may be Sapia of Siena, who speaks to Dante in the text.  She flies or hovers with her torso facing away and her legs extended behind her and down to the right.  Her arms are down but bent up at the elbow and held out from her sides.  Several more quite indistinct figures appear in the crevice.  These figures may be singing, as the text suggests, or may be ascending to another ledge higher up the mountain.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place on the mountain of Purgatory, which rises through the left side of the design.  A series of stone steps forming a staircase has been cut into the side of the mountain.  It rises from the lower left corner of the design and curves gently leftward around the edge of the mountain.  Tall flames engulf the stone staircase where it curves leftward out of sight; they rise above the mountainside towards the top edge of the design.  The fire here extends down over the outside edge of the staircase as well.  Additional flames burn along the inner edge of the staircase nearer the lower left corner of the design.  The sea is visible to the right of the mountain.  Waves ripple its surface, which also reflects light from above.  Wash above the horizon line suggests the sky at sunset.  A thin semi-circular sliver of the setting sun is visible just above the horizon line.  It sends out thin beams of light across the sky.  An angel hovers before the flames at the top of the section of stairs visible in this design.  He faces forward.  His right arm is raised at 135 degrees; his right hand may be open with palm up.  His slightly bent left arm is raised vertically.  The palm of his left hand may face forward.  The angel's left leg is bent and extended backwards.  His large wings are folded behind him, and his long curly hair flies around his face.  Dante climbs the stairs in the lower left corner of the design between Virgil, on the right, and the Roman poet Statius, on the left.  Dante faces away and raises both bent arms vertically, clasping his hands above his head.  His bent right leg is forward, with the foot resting on a higher step.  His left leg is bent and extended backwards, and his left toes touch a lower step.  He seems to crouch, and may bend his head back to look at the flames above.  Virgil climbs the stairs above and to the right of Dante, his body facing away and slightly right.  His slightly bent right leg is extended behind him, and his right toes rest lightly on a lower step.  His left foot, which is planted on a higher step, is just visible beneath his right knee.  He bends backward and left slightly, and turns and bends his head to look left and back towards Dante.  His left arm is extended and drawn back towards his companion, with the hand open and palm facing out.  His right arm is raised vertically; his right hand is open with the palm vertical.  The spirit of Statius follows Dante and Virgil up the steep set of stairs.  He climbs to the left of Dante.  He faces away, but bends his head back and turns it to the right so that his face is visible in partial profile looking up.  His bent left leg is extended behind him and his left foot is on tiptoe.  His right leg seems to be bent forward.  He raises his left arm vertically overhead, with hand open and palm up and out.  His right arm is down by his side and bent at the elbow. </illusobjdesc>

                <illustration location="E" type="plate">
                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place on the mountain of Purgatory, which fills most of the design and extends beyond the right edge.  The distant sea is just visible between the left edge of the design and the edge of the mountain.  Waves ripple the surface of the water.  Wash above and to the left of the mountain suggests the sky, which is lighter nearer the upper right corner of the design and darkens as it approaches the left edge.  A ledge forming a path slopes upward from the lower right corner of the design to the left side of the mountain.  It drops into a cliff on the near side of the path.  Grass covers the surface of this ledge.  At least half a dozen lightly intertwined vines bearing scattered leaves on their branches grow from the edge of the path down over the vertical face of the cliff.  Several ferns grow from the edge of the path near the lower right corner of the design.  Other leaves growing here may belong to additional indeterminate vegetation.  Enormous flames rise from the ledge and stretch almost to the top edge of the design.  The tops of other flames are visible above the highest visible surface of the mountain, in the upper right corner of the design.  A tree grows up the right edge of the design, above the heads of the figures who stand on the ledge below.  The tree's branches are visible between its leaves.  Dante stands or walks on the ledge near the right edge of the design.  His lower body faces forward and left, but he twists farther forward at the waist and bends rightward slightly.  His left leg is forward.  His head is bent and turned slightly left.  Both of his arms are bent and raised roughly vertically; he clasps his hands together above his head.  His mouth is open.  The Roman poet Statius stands or walks on the ledge next to the right edge of the design, to the right of Dante.  He faces left and away, and is seen mostly from behind.  His head may be slightly lowered.  His left leg is extended behind him; his left foot is on tiptoe.  His upper left arm is down and drawn forward, perhaps across his chest.  Virgil, to the left of Dante, has already entered the flames.  He walks on his tiptoes with his left leg extended behind him.  His lower body faces left, but he twists away and to the right at the waist so that his torso is seen from behind.  He bends backward as well.  He turns his head farther right to look behind him at Dante.  His slightly bent right arm is drawn back and extended at 45 degrees, towards Dante, with the palm facing out.  He holds his left arm up at 135 degrees, with the lower arm bent to the vertical.  His raised left hand is open with the vertical palm facing out.  His mouth may be open and his eyes seem to be raised.  An angel is visible in the flames above Virgil.  She flies or hovers facing forward, though her lower body may twist leftward slightly.  She bends right at the waist, lowering and turning her head rightward a bit, perhaps to look at Dante below and to the right.  Her arms are down by her side, bent slightly out from her body at the elbows; her open hands face out in a welcoming gesture.  Her bent left leg is forward, while her right leg is hidden.  Her long curly hair seems to float around her head.  Her wings are folded behind her back.  Four female spirits wearing transparent gowns hover in the flames to the left of Dante.  Their positions suggest that they are dancing.  The rightmost spirit faces forward in a contrapposto position, with her shoulders twisted slightly right and her hips and lower body twisted slightly left.  She bends to the right slightly, and her hips curve left.  Her left leg is bent forward, while her right is extended behind her with her right foot pointed.  Her slightly bent arms are raised over her head with the right arm crossing the midline of her body.  Her long curly hair falls behind her back, floating rightward to the right of her hips.  The lower body of the spirit second from right faces left, but she twists her torso forward at the waist and turns her head slightly farther to the right so that her face is seen in three-quarters profile.  She bends backward slightly at the waist.  Her right leg is crossed behind her left at the ankle, and both feet are pointed.  She raises both slightly bent arms vertically overhead.  Shorter pieces of her long curly hair stand on end, while longer locks float to the right behind her back.  The lower body of the spirit second from left faces forward, but she twists her torso left and bends backward at the waist.  Her head is bent back but turned to look forward.  Both arms, slightly bent, reach vertically overhead.  Her left leg is bent and extended behind her.  Both feet may be on tiptoe.  Long curly hair falls down her back.  The leftmost spirit faces away, bending her torso to the right and curving her hips slightly to the left.  Her body takes a contrapposto position, with her hips facing slightly left and her shoulders facing slightly right.  She raises her arms above her head to the right, with her hands clasped together.  Her right leg is bent forward, while her left leg may be extended backward slightly.  Both feet are pointed.  Her hair lies between her shoulders.  </illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place on the mountain of Purgatory, which rises through the left side of the design.  A series of stone steps forming a staircase begins near the lower left corner of the design and curls gently leftward around the mountain as it rises.  A low stone wall bounds the staircase on the right side.  The mountain drops into a cliff on the other side of the wall.  A low bar or ridge of rock, part of the mountain, bounds the stairs on the left.  A thickly leaved vine grows along the top of the wall on the right, its foliage overflowing onto the stairs midway down.  Small leafy almost vine-like plants grow up between the ridge on the left and the stairs.  Near the lower left corner of the design, two small patches of grass grow on the ridge between this foliage and the left edge of the design.  A small tree or tree-like bush grows on top of the ridge near where it ends, just to the left of the stairs as they curve around the side of the mountain.  A flowering palm or similar plant, with three leaves and two blooms, grows at the base of the tree.  Small leafy plants, like those growing at the left of the stairs, also grow on either side of the tree.  A patch of grass or even smaller plants grows near the left edge of the design, below and to the left of the tree.  Grass covers the right side of the mountain in the upper left corner of the design.  The sea is visible between the side of the mountain and the right edge of the design.  Waves ripple its surface.  Wash above the horizon line of the sea and to the right of the mountain suggests the nighttime sky.  Four stars and a large and luminous moon hang in the sky.  The moon sends beams of light in all directions.  Statius lies sleeping on his side on the steps, facing away.  His legs rest on the step second from lowest; he bends left at the waist to raise his torso, and props his upper body against the next highest step.  His bent arms are raised and lie horizontally along the higher step.  His head is lowered.  His left leg is bent backwards so that the bottom of his left sole faces out.  Dante sleeps lying on his side on a step above Statius.  He faces forward with his left leg hidden behind his right, which is extended along the step to the right.  His right upper arm lies along the step and his right lower arm is bent up around his head, with his hand resting palm down over his temple.  His head is turned down slightly, and his eyes are closed.  Virgil lies on his side one step above Dante.  He faces forward and bends right at the waist to raise his torso.  His weight is propped on his bent left arm, which is down; his left forearm lies along the step.  His right arm, slightly bent, rests along his side.  His legs extend together to the left: the right may be slightly behind the left.  His head is turned slightly left and his eyes are raised.  He is the only one of the three poets who is awake.  A tableau depicting Rachel and Leah appears within the moon above.  Rachel sits on the upper left, facing right and gazing into a standing mirror.  Long hair cascades down her back.  Her right arm is down and bent, with the elbow resting on her lap and the lower arm raised.  She makes a pointing gesture with the index finger of her raised right hand.  A lock of her long hair may drape over her far shoulder and run through her loose fingers.  Alternatively she may be combing her hair.  The backrest and one rear leg of her chair are visible; its right front leg is hidden beneath Rachel's skirts.  The mirror or cheval glass into which she gazes stands to the right of her chair.  It faces forward and left, reflecting Rachel's figure from the waist up.  Leah sits on the lower right, facing forward, beneath the Tree of Error and Mystery.  Her right leg is bent and drawn up, while her bent left leg rests on the ground.  Her arms seem to be down, and her left arm may rest on her lap.  Her head is bent.  The leafy branches of the Tree of Error and Mystery are visible above her head and to the right.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene shows heaven on the far bank of the river Lethe, which undulates across the design from the lower left corner to the middle of the right edge.  Thick grass and flowers carpet the banks of the river on both sides.  The flowers may be anemones.  Two tall trees are rooted in the lower right corner of the design.  Their trunks grow up the right side of the design, and their leafy branches fill the upper right corner.  The branches of the leftmost tree arch more than halfway across the upper edge of the design.  Another tall tree grows from the edge of the far bank, very near the left edge of the design.  Several of its leafy branches arch rightward across the top of the design.  Together with the trees on the right, these branches form a kind of frame for the scene.  Dante stands alone on the near side of the river, facing left and away.  His face is visible in partial profile from behind, looking left.  His arms are down by his side but bent up at the elbow so that his lower arms are raised before him with the open hands facing away from his body.  Virgil and Statius stand together between the trunks of the trees that are rooted in the lower right corner of the design.  Both face left and away.  Virgil stands on the left and seems to bend backwards slightly.  Statius stands on the right, bending his left arm and open left hand up in front of his chest.  Matilda stands on the far bank of the river, to the left of Dante.  She faces forward, turning her head slightly right.  Her slightly bent right arm is down by her side, while her left arm is bent up at the elbow and her left hand is raised.  A large candelabrum hovers on the far bank of the river Lethe at the left side of the design.  Its central stem is carved to resemble a palm tree trunk.  Six branches supporting large multicolored flames emerge from this central stem, which rises to become a slender branch with a seventh flame.  All seven flames are reflected on the surface of the river below.  Multicolored light streams rightward from the flames on the candelabrum, forming a horizontal rainbow.  The other figures in the procession are visible through the transparent colored light.  A carved angel wearing a long gown rests on each branch of the candelabrum.  The angel on the central stem faces forward with wings spread on either side of his or her body.  The angels on the side branches mirror their horizontal counterparts, facing forward and out from the central stem.  One end of a long cloud supports the candelabrum that hovers on the far bank of the river Lethe at the left side of the design.  The cloud winds along the ground beside Lethe as the river curves towards the right edge of the design.  It follows the path of the river most closely in the rightmost third of the design.  Angels stand on either side of the candelabrum that hovers on the far bank of the river Lethe at the left side of the design.  Their feet rest on a segment of the cloud that supports the candelabrum.  The angel on the left faces forward and slightly left, and turns his head to the right slightly.  His right arm is down by his side; a large closed book is tucked under and supported by his right forearm.  His left arm is down but bent up and out at the elbow.  The angel on the right faces forward and slightly right.  His right arm is down but bent up and out at the elbow.  His left arm is down by his side, and he holds a large closed book against his side with his left lower arm.  A large chariot, cart, or wagon forms part of a procession of figures winding leftward across the design on the far bank of the river.  The chariot has a flat platform where Beatrice stands.  A spiral of fire forms the chariot's left wheel.  Flames extend diagonally up to the right from the wheel.  Four large wings rise from the corners of the chariot and meet overhead.  Spots on the wings represent eyes.  A gryphon pulls the chariot.  The large creature is visible at the left of the chariot, facing left.  Its large wings are raised high above its back.  A thin, transparent cloud begins above the wings of the gryphon, rises up to pass the top of the large wings that form part of the chariot, and trails away over the heads of the figures near the end of the procession.  Scattered flower petals rain down from before this cloud, to the left of the gryphon's upraised wings.  Beatrice stands facing forward and left on the flat platform of the chariot.  She leans back slightly, with her right arm extended down by her side.   Her left arm is down but bent up and forward at the elbow.  A cloak drapes over her head and falls to the platform.  She may be holding the edge of the cloak with her right hand.  A group of elders files between the candelabrum at the left of the design and the chariot near the center of the design.  They are bunched in a group, and most of them are not delineated distinctly.  The four that are most clearly visible walk in file facing forward and left.  They wear long gowns and all seem to have long hair and long beards.  The tops of multiple heads are visible above these men, suggesting the presence of many more elders in the group.  Four women dance while holding hands in a circle in front of the fiery wheel of the chariot.  The leftmost figure faces forward with her right arm down by her side and her left arm extended horizontally to the right.  The rightmost figure faces left and extends her arms horizontally in front of her.  One of the women positioned in the center of the ring mostly obscures a second.  The woman in the front faces away but may turn her head to the left so that her face is seen in profile.  She extends her arms horizontally on either side of her body.  The other woman in the center of the ring, who is mostly hidden, seems to face forward but turns her head to the left.  Her right arm is down by her side but bent up, while her left arm may be raised horizontally or may be extended out from her body to the right at 45 degrees.  Seven male figures walking in single file follow the chariot.  The two leftmost of these are old men who walk near one another.  The rightmost of this pair supports a sword, scepter, or rod against his left arm and shoulder.  Four more men of the group of seven walk in a bunch slightly separate from the older pair.  The first and fourth of these seem to hold swords, rods, or scepters, while the second and fourth carry bags or sacks on their backs.  The seventh and final figure is visible through the trunks of the trees on the right side of the design, walking alone.  He seems to bend his head downward and fold his arms across his chest.</illusobjdesc>

He faces forward and left, and seems to bend his head downward and fold his arms across his chest.  He wears a long gown and may have long hair.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place on the banks of the river Lethe, though the river itself is not visible.  The ground at the bottom of the design is flat and carpeted with grass and blossoms.  Bands of colored light cross the sky horizontally the width of the design, forming a kind of rainbow.  A thin ribbon of cloud begins near the upper left corner, curving gently across the top of the design until it meets the band of cloud surrounding the halo of the gryphon that stands at the right.  Several other fainter ribbons of cloud are visible above the first.  A chariot fills the left side of the design.  Its right wheel is a vortex of flames, in which swirling figures and disembodied eyes appear.   Beasts with enormous upraised wings stand at each of the four corners of the chariot.  Large eyes are scattered over each of the beasts' wings.  The beasts' heads, each with a halo, are visible between their upraised wings.  The head of the creature farthest left is an eagle's, the head of the creature second to left is a lion's, the head of the creature third from left is a man's, and the head of the creature farthest right is a bull's.  Beatrice stands facing forward on the chariot's platform.  Her weight is shifted to her left leg, and her left hip curves out to the right.  Her right leg is bent at the knee, and her right foot may be on tiptoe.  Her slightly bent right arm is down by her side with the palm of her open hand facing forward and her fingers spread.  Her left arm is down but bent up at the elbow; her upraised left hand is open with the palm facing forward and the fingers spread.  She wears a transparent gown through which her figure is plainly visible.  A cloak drapes over her head and shoulders and falls to her feet, where it puddles on the platform.  Her long curly hair hangs down her back almost to her knees.  She wears a crown on her head.  Her head emits light like a halo.  A gryphon pulls the chariot; this creature is visible at the right of the chariot, facing right.  Its feathered wings are raised high above its back.  Beams of light stream from its head.  A thin cloud makes a semi-circle around the creature's head, forming a kind of halo with the light.  Dante's text portrays three women dancing near the right wheel of the chariot.  One of these women stands or dances next to the left edge of the design.  She faces forward, but twists at the waist so that her torso is turned slightly left and her lower body is turned slightly right.  Both of her arms are raised vertically overhead.  Her hands are open and she makes a pointing gesture with the index fingers of both hands.  Both feet are on tiptoe.  She wears a long semi-transparent gown that eddies around her legs.  To the right, a second woman stands or walks facing forward and right.  Her head is bent but her eyes are raised.  Her right arm is down by her side and drawn back slightly.  Her left arm is down but bent up at the elbow; she holds her raised left hand open with the vertical palm facing forward.  She wears a long semi-transparent gown, which reveals that her left leg is bent and extended backward with the left foot on tiptoe.  A headband with jewels, beading, or similar adornment circles her head.  Five nude infants hover around her lower body, facing forward.  Three are visible to the right of her legs, and two to the left.  A third woman stands or walks to the right of the wheel.  Her weight rests on her left foot, while her slightly bent right leg is extended behind her and her right foot is on tiptoe.  Her lower body faces right but she twists away at the waist so that her torso is seen from behind; she turns her head even further and tilts it back to look left and up.  Her right arm is raised horizontally to the right.  Her left arm is raised at 45 degrees, and she rests the tip of her left index finger on the page of a book that lies open on a cloud to the left.  She wears a transparent gown that swirls around her leg.  Dante stands or walks in the lower right corner of the design, facing left and forward.  He lowers his head but raises his eyes to look up at Beatrice, above him to the left.  His left arm is down by his side but bent forward at the elbow.  Both of his hands are raised in front of his chest; they are open with fingers spread and vertical palms facing in towards each other.  The shape of the long gown he wears indicates that his left leg is bent backwards at the knee.</illusobjdesc>

The third head is visible below the first, facing forward but tilted back with eyes raised.  This figure's mouth seems to be open.

                        <illusobjdesc>Beatrice stands facing forward on the chariot's platform.  She turns her head to the right slightly.  Her weight is shifted to her left leg, and her left hip curves out to the right.  Her right leg is bent back at the knee, and her right foot may be on tiptoe.  Her slightly bent right arm is down by her side with the palm of her open hand facing forward and her fingers spread.  Her left arm is down but bent up at the elbow; her upraised left hand is open with the palm facing forward and the fingers spread.  She wears a transparent gown through which her figure is plainly visible.  A cloak drapes over her head and shoulders and falls to her feet, where it puddles on the platform.  Her long curly hair hangs down her back almost to her knees.  She wears a crown on her head.  Her head emits light like a halo.  The shape of the light around her suggests, but does not quite fully constitute, a mandorla.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>Dante stands or walks in the lower right corner of the design, facing left and forward.  He lowers his head but raises his eyes to look up at Beatrice, above him to the left.  His left arm is down by his side but bent forward at the elbow.  Both of his hands are raised in front of his chest; they are open with fingers spread and vertical palms facing in towards each other.  As a result, his right palm faces out towards the viewer.  The shape of the long gown he wears indicates that his left leg is bent backwards at the knee.  He has long curly hair.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place on the opposite bank of the river Lethe.  The ground at the bottom of the design is flat and may be covered with grass.  Thorny vines grow along the ground below and to the right of feet belonging to the giant who stands at the center of the design.  The trunk of a large tree grows through the right side of the design.  Two of its branches, bare of leaves but dangling large round fruits on stems or much smaller branches, extend diagonally up to the right through the upper right corner of the design.  Another branch arches leftward from the trunk to the upper edge of the design.  Round fruits attached to smaller branches hang throughout the upper left corner of the design.  Wash above and around the figures suggests the sky, which is dark to the right of the tree and lighter to the left.  The Great Beast of Revelation with its seven heads appears at the left side of the design.  Its body takes the form of a snake standing on upright coils, supporting the Whore of Babylon above.  Its long tail undulates up the left side of the design into the upper left corner.  Its neck is raised to the right.  The seven heads appear along its scaly neck and coils.  The rightmost head is attached to the terminal end of the Beast's body, and is turned to face forward.  Though this head has large human-like or simian ears, its snout suggests a dog or similar animal.  It wears an elaborate papal crown surmounted with a cross.  The head second from right faces right and away, and is seen partly from behind.  This head has the horns and perhaps the ears of a bull.  It wears a crown.  The head third from right is very bovine, facing forward with eyes raised.  It has horns at its temples.  A line of shaggy hair or fur circles its face like a mane.  Its mouth is open, revealing its teeth and tongue.  It wears a crown.  A fourth head is visible just above, facing left and away and seen mostly from behind.  It has two horns, one above its forehead and one apparently emerging from the right side of its skull.  The features of the final three heads are human.  The third from left faces forward; a single horn, which also suggests a crown, sprouts from the top of its head.  Second from left, a head with long hair looks left.  A single horn reminiscent of a crown grows from its forehead.  The wrinkles on this head's face make it appear to be old.  The leftmost head is tilted back but looks forward.  It has long curly hair, a beard, and a curled mustache.  A single horn, much like a crown, appears above its forehead.  The Whore of Babylon sits on the back of the Great Beast.  Her torso, facing forward and right, is visible above its many heads.  Her feet, clad in slim shoes, are visible just below the scaly neck of the Beast's rightmost head.  She holds her arms out to the sides of her body at 45 degrees, bent up to 135 degrees at the elbow.  She points to the right with the index finger of her raised left hand and grasps a large goblet in her upraised right hand.  Frothy liquid bubbles at the rim of the goblet and drips down on either side.  Her head is tilted back; she purses her lips to kiss the giant to the right.  A three-tiered crown rests on her head, and she wears an earring in her right ear and two large rings on her left index finger.  A male giant stands near the Whore, to the right.  His lower body faces forward, but he bends left at the waist to bring his face closer to the Whore's, twisting his upper body to face slightly left as well.  He kisses the Whore on the mouth.  He extends his left arm out at 45 degrees, and with the fingers and thumb of this hand he holds one tasseled end of a rope tied to the rightmost head of the Beast.  The giant has a beard and short curly hair, and wears a full suit of armor.  Beatrice is visible to the right of the giant's legs.  She kneels beneath the tree, with her legs bent and drawn up beneath her.  Her body faces forward and right, but she turns her head to the left.  Her arms are by her side, bent up at the elbow with open hands raised and palms facing up and out. Three women stand clustered together near the right edge of the design.  The rightmost of these stands facing away, but turns her head and tilts it back so that her face is visible in profile looking up to the left.  Her curly hair is piled on top of her head in a bun.  Her arms are visible to the elbow, down by her side.  The woman in the middle faces forward, through she turns her bent head slightly left.  Her right arm is by her side but drawn forward and bent at the elbow across her chest.  Her left hand is just visible to the left of the rightmost woman's hip; it supports a large closed book against the woman's upper body.  She rests her right hand on the top of the book.  The lower body of the woman to the left faces forward, though she bends and twists right at the waist towards the woman in the middle.  Her right arm is by her side but drawn forward and bent at the elbow across her chest.  Her raised right hand rests on her breast and she may hold the neckline of her gown with this hand.  Her left forearm is bent up in front of her upper body and her left hand rests on or supports her cheek.  She may lean against or touch the woman to the right.</illusobjdesc>

Her body faces forward and right, but she turns her head left, so that her face is seen in three-quarters profile looking left.  She also tilts it back slightly.  Her arms are by her side, bent up at the elbow with open hands raised and palms facing up and out.  She wears a long transparent gown that reveals her figure, and has long curly hair.  She may wear a crown on her head.  Her mouth may be open slightly, and her eyes may be raised.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This design, executed entirely in pencil, is set in Paradise.  A dome at the bottom of the design suggests part of an orb, perhaps the surface of the earth.  A narrow staircase spirals up from the orb to the top edge of the design, forming five loops that contract in size as they rise.  Indistinct lines on either side of the staircase and below it, on the orb of the earth, suggest clouds in a sky.  Four stars are visible in the sky, two on either side of the staircase.  A number of tiny figures are visible near the base of the staircase where it leaves the orb.  The figures in the lowest grouping stand or walk at the base of the staircase, farthest left.  They are difficult to distinguish but the number of heads suggests that there may be as many as five, who may face to the right and away.  To the right of this grouping, and slightly above them, a pair ascends facing right and away.  The figure on the right is taller than the one on the left, who may be a child.  The figure on the right steps up with right leg bent forward.  This figure may bend its head; its left arm is down and drawn back slightly, holding the raised right hand of the childlike figure on the left.  This childlike figure may extend one leg backwards.  Above the lowest and leftmost grouping, and slightly to the right, a third group ascends together facing right and away.  The number of heads suggests that there may be four figures in this group.  At least three of the figures draw one extended arm back at 45 degrees, and step up in unison with bent legs.  Above the pair holding hands and to the left, a single figure stands, apparently facing right.  This figure may hold something unidentifiable in its right hand.  Above the pair holding hands and to the right, another single figure is visible.  This figure seems to face forward and slightly left, and may step down with left leg bent backwards.  The figure's right arm seems to be down by its side.  To the right and slightly above this figure, another single figure stands whose exact position is difficult to decipher.  It may be facing away and ascending, or facing forward and descending the stairs.  At the far right of the lowest curve in the staircase, a loosely sketched figure stands or walks.  Below and to the left of this figure, a loose line may be intended to represent yet another single figure standing or walking on the stairs.  A series of five figures are visible standing or walking along the lower curve of the lowest full spiral in the staircase.  The two leftmost figures seem to face and walk to the right, and may have large wings.  The three rightmost figures are sketched so loosely that details of their positions and features are impossible to discern, though all three seem to be standing.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The figure of Christ stands facing forward with his head near the top of the design, which represents a vision Dante describes having in the Fifth Heaven.  Christ's legs are together, though the right is bent back slightly at the knee; his feet rest on a fiery sun.  His right foot may be on tiptoe.  He extends his arms horizontally to either side of his body, holding his upraised hands out with vertical palms facing forward.  This posture suggests the crucifixion.  His mouth may be open slightly.  He has a beard and long curly hair that spills down his back, visible beneath his arms on either side.  His transparent gown seems to shimmer with movement around his legs.  Clouds and flames surround Christ, from whom emits the beams of light visible below his feet, to the right of his left leg, and below his left arm.  Flames blow upward from the sun beneath Christ's feet.  Two more suns burn on either side of his body, one behind each of Christ's upraised hands.  Each sun radiates light and flames that fill their respective corners of the design.  Dante kneels at the bottom of the design, facing away.  His legs are bent and drawn up beneath him with the knees spread wide; both feet are on tiptoe with the soles facing out.  He leans back and to the right, and tilts his head back sharply to look up at Christ above.  His arms are extended at 135 degrees and spread wide on either side of his body.  His upraised hands are open with the palms facing up.  He has long curly hair, and wears a semi-transparent gown.  Clouds, smoke, and flame billow up from either side of Dante to merge with the sun's fire and surround the figure of Christ above.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place in the Sixth Heaven of Paradise, where the throne of the Recording Angel rests on the fallen world.  A gently curving line near the bottom of the design represents the surface of the fallen world.  The Recording Angel sits on a throne that rests on this curving surface.  The angel's wings and gown obscure almost all of this seat except for its base, which extends out along the surface of the world to left and right.  The  Recording Angel sits facing forward.  His legs are bent forward and an open scroll is draped across his lap.  His left arm is down by his side and bent forward at the elbow.  He holds one rolled end of the scroll loosely in his left hand.  His right arm is down but bent forward, and his lower right arm rests on his thigh.  He holds a quill pen loosely with his right hand; his right index finger lies lightly along its shaft in a pointing gesture.  He may be writing on the scroll in his lap.  The toes of his left foot peek from beneath the hem of his gown, decorated with a chevron pattern.  His long beard reaches all the way to his lap, while tendrils of his long, flame-like hair stand on end.  His eyes are raised and his eyebrows creased.  His large feathered wings are raised and their tips touch far above his head.  The outline of his wings suggests a mandorla.  A star glimmers above his head, between his upraised wings.  Two more stars are visible below his throne, one on either side of his feet.  Wash surrounding his figure suggests the sky, with the suggestion of clouds at the left and right edges of the design near the base of the throne.</illusobjdesc>

His legs are bent forward and an open scroll is draped across his lap.  His left arm is down by his side and bent forward at the elbow.  He holds one rolled end of the scroll loosely in his left hand.  His right arm is down but bent forward, and his lower right arm rests on his thigh.  He holds a quill pen loosely with his right hand; his right index finger lies lightly along its shaft in a pointing gesture.  He may be writing on the scroll on his lap.  The toes of his left foot peek from beneath the hem of his gown, decorated with a chevron pattern.  His long beard reaches all the way to his lap, while tendrils of his long, flame-like hair stand on end.  His eyes are raised and his eyebrows creased.  His large feathered wings are raised and their tips touch far above his head.  The outline of his wings suggests a mandorla.</illusobjdesc>

Two transparent and imbricated spheres fill the design; the sphere on the right overlaps the one on the left, partially hiding it.  Sketched lines around both spheres suggest that angels fly or hover at their edges.  Wash around the spheres and inside them suggests the sky, lit with varying shades of light.  Beatrice stands in contrapposto, facing forward, just to the right of the midpoint of the design.  Her weight rests on her right leg; her left leg is bent backwards slightly and her left foot is on tiptoe.  Her right hip bows out slightly.  Both of her arms are down by her side but bent up and out at the elbow.  Her open hands are raised with the vertical palms facing forward.  She turns her head to the left, and tilts it forward and left slightly.  Her eyes are raised.  She wears a crown, and a long transparent gown swirls around her legs.  Tendrils of her long curly hair seem to float on either side of her body.  Dante stands in contrapposto, facing away, to the left of Beatrice.  His weight rests on his right leg, while his left leg is bent back slightly and his left foot rests on tiptoe.  The sole of his left foot is visible.  He seems to bend backwards slightly at the waist.  His head is turned to the right and he seems to look at Beatrice, who stands to the right.  His arms are by his side but bent up and out at the elbow.  His right hand is open with the palm facing out from his body.

                    <illusobjdesc>The hovering figures of St. Peter, Beatrice, and Dante fill much of the design, which represents a vision of Dante's in Paradise.  Wash around the figures suggests the sky.  St. Peter flies or hovers inside a flame near the top of the design.  His body is roughly horizontal, with his lower body facing away and extending to the right.  He may be descending.  His right leg extends behind him, out toward the viewer, and may be bent at the knee; the sole of his right foot is visible.  His upper body inclines diagonally down to the left.  He also bends backwards sharply and bends his head back, so that his face looks forward and down.  His right arm is raised at 45 degrees and bent to the right; he holds the shaft of a large key in his right hand.  His left hand is visible, open with the palm facing out, below and to the right of his head.  He has long curly hair and a long beard, and wears a long gown.  Spiky beams of light issue from the flame, which also emits a diffuse radiance.  Beatrice flies or hovers below St. Peter to the right.  Her body faces left and down and extends on a diagonal with her head upper left and her feet lower right.  She bends backwards at the waist slightly and tilts her head back to look up at St. Peter above, turning it forward so that her face is visible in three-quarters profile.  She raises both arms at roughly 135 degrees to the left, though her right arm is slightly higher than the left, which may also be bent slightly.  Her left palm faces up while her right palm faces forward and up.  She appears to be reaching upward to receive the key from Peter.  Her left leg, down to the right, seems to be twisted so that the knee faces forward; her left foot may be on tiptoe.  A crown circles her head, over the long curly hair that extends down her back.  Her long semi-transparent gown ripples down her legs, suggesting her movement, and billows past her feet.  Dante flies or hovers to the left, on a diagonal with his head at upper right and his legs extending down to the left.  His lower body faces down, but he twists away at the waist so that his upper body is seen from behind.  He bends backward at the waist slightly and tilts his head back, turning it up so that his face is visible in profile looking up.  His mouth is open and his eyes are raised.  Both arms are by his sides but bent up at the elbow; he holds his forearms just to either side of his body.  His raised hands are open with the vertical palms facing away from his body.  He wears a long transparent gown and has long curly hair.  His right foot, visible through his gown, is on tiptoe.  His gestures and expression suggest surprise or awe.</illusobjdesc>

His body is roughly horizontal, with his lower body facing away and extending to the right.  His right leg extends behind him, out toward the viewer, and may be bent at the knee; the sole of his right foot is visible.  His upper body inclines diagonally down to the left.  He also bends backwards sharply and bends his head back, so that his face looks forward and down.  His mouth is open, displaying his teeth.  With lowered eyes, he seems to be looking at Beatrice below him to the right.  His right arm is raised at 45 degrees and bent to the right; he holds the shaft of a large key in his right hand.  He may be descending to give the key to Beatrice.  His left hand is visible, open with the palm facing out, below and to the right of his head.  He has long curly hair and a long beard, and wears a long gown.</illusobjdesc>

Her body faces left and down, and extends on a diagonal with her head upper left and her feet lower right.  She bends backwards at the waist slightly and tilts her head back to look up at St. Peter above, turning it forward so that her face is visible in three-quarters profile.  Her eyes are raised and her mouth may be open slightly.  She raises both arms at roughly 135 degrees to the left, though her right arm is slightly higher than the left, which may also be bent slightly.  Both upraised hands are open.  Her left palm faces up while her right palm faces forward and up.  She appears to be reaching upward to receive the key from Peter.  Her left leg, down to the right, seems to be twisted so that the knee faces forward; her left foot may be on tiptoe.  A crown circles her head, over the long curly hair that extends down her back.  Her long semi-transparent gown ripples down her legs, suggesting her movement, and billows past her feet.</illusobjdesc>

Both arms are by his sides but bent up at the elbow; he holds his forearms just to either side of his body.  His raised hands are open with the vertical palms facing away from his body.  He wears a long transparent gown and has long curly hair.  His right foot, visible through his gown, is on tiptoe.  His gestures and expression suggest surprise or awe.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The hovering figures of St. Peter, St. James, Beatrice, and Dante fill much of this design, which represents a vision of Dante's in Paradise.  Wash around the figures suggests the sky.  Two of the figures, enclosed in large flames, fill much of the top half of this design.  The figure on the left represents St. Peter.  His body is largely horizontal, but he bends backwards slightly at the waist and lifts his head to look forward and right.  He extends his bent right arm horizontally to the right, holding up the first two fingers of his raised right hand as if he bestows a blessing or benediction.  His left hand is visible below his chest, open with the palm up and holding a large key against his torso.  His lower body extends left and away; his right leg is bent up at the knee and the bottom of his right foot is visible.  His similarly raised left foot appears below and to the right of his right foot.  He has a long beard and long curly hair; he wears a long semi-transparent gown that swirls around his legs.  The flame in which he appears extends up towards the upper left corner of the design.  The figure in the flame on the right represents St. James.  His body extends diagonally up towards the upper right corner of the design.  His lower body faces forward, but he twists his upper body down very slightly.  His legs are together and seem to be slightly bent; his right foot hides his left.  His left arm is by his side, bent up with the hand positioned in front of his torso and perhaps resting on his beard.  His right arm is bent upward and slightly raised.  His right hand, extended towards St. Peter on the left, is open with the palm facing forward and up.  St. James' head is tilted back slightly and he looks forward and to the left.  He has long curly hair and a long beard as well, and he wears a long semi-transparent gown.  Spiky beams of light issue from both flames, which also emit a diffuse radiance.  Small tongues of fire are visible between the beams.  Beneath the figures of the saints, Dante flies or hovers near the bottom edge of the design.  His lower body faces down and slightly away, but he twists and bends backward and right at the waist so that his upper body faces away and is seen from behind.  He extends his arms to either side; the right arm is raised horizontally, while the left is raised at 135 degrees.  Both hands are open with the palms facing up and away.  He bends his head back slightly and turns it to the right, so that the right side of his face is partly visible, looking up.  His eyes are raised.  He wears a long semi-transparent gown and has long curly hair falling over his shoulders.  Beatrice likewise flies or hovers just above Dante and to the right, hiding him slightly.  Her body is mostly horizontal, but she twists and bends at the waist so that her torso extends up to the right and faces away.  Her lower body faces down and is extended to the left, with at least her right foot on tiptoe.  She holds her slightly bent arms out horizontally to either side, with her hands open and the palms facing down.  Her head is tilted back to look up, and turned so that her face is visible in profile.  Her long curly hair floats around her shoulders.  She wears a transparent gown.</illusobjdesc>

The flame in which he appears extends up towards the upper right corner of the design.  Spiky beams of light issue from the flame, which also emits a diffuse radiance.  Small tongues of fire may be visible between the beams, especially below St. James.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Three large, glowing spheres dominate the design, which represents a vision of Dante's in Paradise.  A bright arc crosses the design above the two lowermost spheres.  Eight stars appear on the arc, divided evenly to the left and to the right of the uppermost sphere.  Wash fills the spaces around the spheres, suggesting a sky suffused with light.  Four lightly sketched, indistinct figures stand on the arc, with two on either side of the uppermost sphere.  The two figures on the left seem to stand facing forward and to the right, with heads lowered slightly.  The two figures on the right seem to stand facing forward and to the left.  The leftmost of these two figures may lower its head slightly, though this figure is the most indistinct of all.  All four seem to wear long gowns.  Other features are impossible to discern.
                        The leftmost sphere encases St. Peter, who kneels hovering or flying facing right and slightly forward.  His legs are bent backwards at the knee, so that his lower legs extend up to the left and away.  He leans back slightly at the waist, twisting to the right slightly and tilting his head back so that his face is visible in profile looking up to the right.  His right arm is by his side, bent up at the elbow; his open right hand is visible below his chin with the vertical palm facing away.  His lower left arm is down and cradles a large key in front of his body.  He grasps the key with the fingers of his left hand.  He has long curly hair and a long beard, both of which suggest his age.  He wears a long semi-transparent gown.  The rightmost sphere encases St. James.  He kneels hovering or flying facing left and slightly forward.  His legs are bent together and tucked beneath his body.  His left foot is just visible beneath his buttocks, and may be on tiptoe.  His left arm is down by his side, bent up at the elbow.  His raised left hand is open with the vertical palm facing away from the viewer.  His raised right hand is visible to the left of his shoulders, with the vertical palm facing out towards the viewer.  He tilts his head back and raises his eyes to look up.  He has curly long hair and a full beard, both of which suggest his age.  He wears a long semi-transparent gown.  The uppermost sphere encases St. John, who seems younger in appearance than St. James or St. Peter below.  St. John hovers upside down with his torso facing away and slightly left.  His legs are together and bent backwards at the knee, so that the soles of both feet are visible facing out.  He bends his head back sharply, so that his face is visible looking forward and slightly to the right.  His eyes are lowered as though he looks at the figures below him.  His right arm is raised past his head and bent to the right at the elbow, and he holds his open hand out to the right with the palm facing up.  His left arm is also raised; it crosses beneath his right and is bent up with the palm of his open hand facing up.  Thus, both arms are at last partly wrapped around his upper body.  He wears a transparent gown that swirls around his legs.  His long curly hair flies around his head.  All three spheres encasing the saints are radiant with light, and also emit spiky beams of light from segments of their circumferences.
                        Dante and Beatrice kneel beneath the uppermost sphere and between the second and third spheres below.  Dante faces away.  His left leg is bent forward but bent beneath his body at the knee, and his left foot rests on tiptoe with the sole facing partly out.  The sole of his right foot is just visible beneath his buttocks, and his position suggests that his right leg is drawn forward and up.  Both of his arms are down by side but bent up and out at the elbows.  His raised hands are open with the fingers spread and vertical palms facing away from his body.  His left elbow may rest on his left thigh.  He bends his head back sharply.  His face is visible in profile looking up at St. John above.  His long curly hair spills down between his shoulder blades.  He wears a long semi-transparent gown.  Dante hides Beatrice slightly.  Beatrice's head is visible above and to the right of his, looking forward and to the right.  She may tilt her head back slightly.  Her eyes are raised to look up at St. John above.  Her long curly hair floats around her head, while a sliver of light above her hair suggests a halo.  Both of her hands are raised with the vertical palms facing out towards the viewer.  Her right hand and lower right arm are visible to the left of Dante's left shoulder, while her left hand and arm appear above and to the right of Dante's right shoulder.  Part of her lower body, clad in a long gown, may be visible to the right of Dante's right hip.  A segment of the collar of this garment is visible above Dante's right shoulder.</illusobjdesc>

His raised left hand is open with the vertical palm facing away from the viewer.  His raised right hand is visible to the left of his shoulders, with the vertical palm facing out towards the viewer.  He tilts his head back and raises his eyes to look up.  His mouth is slightly open, displaying his teeth.  He has curly long hair and a full beard, both of which suggest his age.  He wears a long semi-transparent gown.</illusobjdesc>

St. John hovers upside down with his torso facing away and slightly left.  His legs are together and bent backwards at the knee, so that the soles of both feet are visible facing out.  He bends his head back sharply, so that his face is visible looking forward and slightly to the right.  His eyes are lowered as though he looks at the figures below him.  His mouth is open slightly.  His right arm is raised past his head and bent to the right at the elbow, and he holds his open hand out to the right with the palm facing up.  His left arm is also raised; it crosses beneath his right and is bent up with the palm of his open hand facing up.  Thus, both arms are at least partly wrapped around his upper body.  He wears a transparent gown that swirls around his legs.  His long curly hair flies around his head.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This design depicts Dante's Paradisal vision of the divine order, which extends from God at the top of the design through the ranks of angels to the earth at the bottom.  Although the Paradiso describes Dante's vision as being of concentric rings, Blake has drawn the rings as curved layers or arcs that cross the design horizontally.  A heavenly body is associated with each arc, and its representation appears at the center of that arc.  A pair of figures, or paired groupings of figures, also appear on each arc.  Clouds surround these figures.  Wash throughout the design suggests the sky.  Flat ground covered with grass runs across the bottom of the design and represents the earth, the material world.  A low hill or knoll, also covered with grass, rises in the center of this flat ground.  The lowest arc is associated with the angels and the moon, which appears as a small sphere at the center of this arc.  Blake depicts the head and shoulders of two of these angels, one at either end of the arc.  Both are male with long curly hair and folded, raised wings.  The arc second to lowest is associated with Mercury and the archangels.  Mercury is depicted as a small sphere, surrounded by a cloud, at the center of this arc.  Blake depicts the head and shoulders of two archangels, one at each end of the arc.  Both are male and turn their heads inward towards Mercury.  A halo surmounts each archangel's curly hair.  Each has one set of large wings bent up behind his back, and a second set of wings drawn up inside the first and visible above his head.  The arc third from lowest is associated with Venus and the Principalities, which appear here as a pair of youthful female angels.  Venus is depicted as a sphere, surrounded by a cloud, at the center of the arc.  The Principalities on this arc turn their heads to look forward and away from Venus.  They have long curly hair and large wings that may fold partly around their bodies.  The arc fourth from the bottom is associated with the Powers, here shown as a pair of middle-aged female angels, and the sun.  The sun is depicted as a glowing sphere emitting beams of light at the center of this arc.  The Powers, with long curly hair floating around their heads, look up and away from the sun.  They have large wings drawn up on either side of their heads.  The arc fifth from the bottom is associated with the Virtues, which appear here as the heads of male soldiers, and with Mars.  Blake depicts Mars as a circle or sphere marked with a cross and surrounded with a cloud.  The soldiers wear helmets and look forward with wings folded. The arc sixth from the bottom is associated with the Dominions, which appear here as bearded men, and with Jupiter.  Blake depicts Jupiter as a sphere surrounded by a cloud at the center of the arc.  Both bearded, long-haired Dominions are visible from the shoulders up; they look forward with wings folded on either side.  The arc third from the top is associated with the Thrones, which appear here as a pair of bearded old men, and with Saturn.  Blake depicts Saturn as a sphere surrounded by a cloud at the center of this arc.  The Thrones tilt their heads forward and turn them inward towards Saturn.  They have beards and long hair, as well as large wings.  The arc second from the top is associated with the Cherubim, which Blake illustrates as a group of female angels at either end of the arc, and with the Fixed Stars.  Blake depicts the Fixed Stars as two angelic figures standing near each other at the center of the arc.  The figures seem to face one another, with the one on the left facing right, and the one on the right facing left.  They bend their heads and wear long gowns; their wings are bent up behind their backs.  At each side of the arc, the heads of three Cherubim are grouped together, looking forward.  The angel nearest the Fixed Stars on both sides raises her inside arm vertically.  The head and shoulders of God appear above the uppermost arc, just below the top edge of the design.  He faces forward and may lower his head, turning it slightly to the right.  His right arm is raised and bent upward at the elbow.  His elbow rests on the arc below.  He holds his raised right hand open with the palm facing forward, and may be bestowing a blessing with this hand.  The fingers of his left hand, which is palm down, rest gently on the arc.  His wings are spread wide on either side of his body, just below the upper edge of the design.  He has a beard and long hair, and wears a gown.  Sketched circles to the left of God's right arm and to the right of his left arm suggest the heads of two crowds of Seraphim, whose other features are impossible to discern.</illusobjdesc>

Clouds mostly hide his body below the neck, although his left shoulder is just suggested.</illusobjdesc>

The Dominion on the right faces forward.  He has a beard and long curly hair, and wears a shirt or gown.  His large folded wings are visible to either side of his head.</illusobjdesc>

Blake illustrates the Fixed Stars as two angelic figures standing near each other at the center of the arc.  The figures seem to face one another, with the one on the left facing right, and the one on the right facing left.  They bend their heads.  They wear long gowns; their wings are bent up behind their backs.  It is impossible to tell if the angels are female or male.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>A river of light pours vertically through the center of this design, which represents the Empyrean.  It streams downward from the sun, which is partially visible as a semi-circle at the top edge of the design.  On either side of the river, beams of light issue from the sun; its radiant light suffuses the sky in the top third of the design.  A wall, perhaps of stone, crosses the design horizontally below the sky.  This wall is visible to either side of the river of light.  The ground below the wall extends to the lower edge of the design; it is flat and may be covered in grass or similar vegetation in places.  Tiny figures cavort in the river's waves of light; some appear to be flying or leaping from its waves.  At least one is descending head first, arms extended.  Most are very indistinct, represented by faintly sketched lines.  A poet sits just before the wall to the left of the river of light.  He faces forward and slightly right with his left leg bent forward.  A scroll rests on his left knee, draping down past his leg to the right.  His right arm is down and bent forward, and his right hand lies on the scroll on his knee.  He may hold a pen in this hand, using it to write on the scroll.  He tilts his head back and raises his eyes to look up; his mouth may be open.  He seems to be seated on a low rock or stone, which is just visible to the right of his legs and the scroll he holds.  A small oak tree or branch grows behind him, in front of the wall.  Below the poet, a group of figures create art of various forms.  At the top of the group, two men(?) stand on either end of what may be an engraver's press.  Below them, a female figure who may be an angel stands to the left of an artist's easel.  A canvas rests on the easel's frame.  Flames surround all of these figures in the group, licking upward from the ground.  A bat-winged devil stands at the left side of the grouping, facing right with his wings raised behind his back.  Below this grouping, Dante kneels just to the left of the river of light, near the bottom of the design.  He faces right and bends forward, hunching his shoulders and lowering his head.  He holds his right arm out from his body and bent up at the elbow.  His raised right hand supports a wide, shallow bowl beneath the stream of the river.  His head is bent to bring his lips to the edge of the bowl to drink its contents.  His eyes are lowered.  A patch of vegetation grows in the lower left corner of the design, to the left of the river of light.  Two taller trees stand side by side near the top of the patch, sending thickly leaved branches upward.  A human form appears amid the leaves of each tree.  A flower bears two blooms and several leaves between the trees.  A third tree, much smaller, grows below and slightly to the left of the two taller trees.  A vine grows along the ground below and to the right of the trees; it bears sparse leaves and large, lush, rose-like buds and blossoms.  A small leafy plant with a single bloom grows to the right of the rightmost tree.  Grass covers much of the ground between the trees and plants in this patch.  An old woman sits to the right of the river of light, just below the wall that crosses the design horizontally.  She faces forward.  Her face is only faintly visible beneath the transparent veil or cloak she wears over her head, which also drapes her shoulders and hides much of her shape.  Her right arm is extended forward at chest level, and she rests her right hand on the top of a large stone tablet.  A young woman sits between the river of light and the right edge of the design.  She faces forward, with her legs bent forward, but turns and tilts her head to the left slightly.  Her left arm is down by her side, and the fingers of her left hand seem to be loosely clasped.  Her right arm is raised at 45 degrees and bent to 135 degrees at the elbow; she holds up a hand mirror in her right hand.  With mouth open and eyes raised she seems to be looking at her reflection in this mirror.  Her long curly hair wafts around her head.  She wears a transparent gown that reveals her figure.  Her feet seem to rest on a cloud.  A group of the same tiny figures that play and leap in the river of light also circle her body; they collect around her head and around her legs.</illusobjdesc>

The same tiny figures that cavort in the river's waves of light also circle around the young woman.  Four of them appear in a vertical row to the left of the woman's right leg.  All four seem to be nude and may be either male or female.  The highest of them flies or hovers in a contracted position, with its torso facing forward and left and its head bent sharply down to the right.  It may also bend right sharply.  Its right arm is raised vertically.  Its left leg is bent forward and drawn up, and its right leg is bent backwards with feet pointed.  Its left arm is drawn across its torso and raised at 45 degrees; this arm may rest on its left thigh.  The figure second from top flies or hovers facing forward with its head turned slightly to the right and its body extended away.  Its arms are not visible but its legs seem to be bent.  The figure third from top seems to fly or hover facing forward.  It may raise its right arm vertically.  Other features are difficult or impossible to discern.  The lowest figure is the faintest and least delineated, but it seems to fly or hover facing forward.  Finally, to the left and just next to the river of light, are some sketchy lines that may be another figure, legs bent and possibly facing left.</illusobjdesc>

                <illustration location="E" type="plate">
                    <illusobjdesc>The Celestial Rose or Rose of Heaven, a giant upward-facing blossom, fills much of this design.  Its petals support multiple figures.  The leaf-like sepals of its calyx are visible near the bottom of the design, below its petals.  Wash in the upper left and right corners of the design indicates the sky.  A series of five celestial objects, including planets, stars, and a crescent moon, extend in a diagonal line across the sky in the upper left corner.  A series of eight celestial objects, including stars, planets, a crescent moon, and perhaps a sun, form a second gentle arch through the sky in the upper right corner.  The Virgin Mary kneels at the center of the Celestial Rose, on one of the highest petals.  Her lower body faces right but she twists her torso forward at the waist.  She holds her arms out horizontally, grasping a large hand mirror in one hand and a large scepter in the other hand.  A halo circles her head.  A ring of tiny cherubs forms a larger ring around her. Faintly sketched female figures recline facing away, one to either side of Mary.  A head to the right of this figure may be an alternative position for this female.  To the left of Mary, near the left edge of the Rose, is a large closed book with a figure seated on its cover.  A chain is wrapped multiple times around the book, holding it shut.  This book represents the Old or New Testament of the Bible; its counterpart appears as a large closed book, also wrapped with a chain, near the right edge of the Rose.  A figure rests on the cover of each book.  These figures, visible from the mid-torso up, may be angels or sphinxes.  A halo of radiant light circles the heads of each, and they may also wear headdresses.  Below and to the right of the tome on the left is a third, smaller book lying open with &quot;Homer&quot; written on one of the pages.  Below and to the left of the tome on the right is a fourth book, lying open with &quot;Aristotle&quot; written on its pages.  
                        Beatrice, nude with visible breasts, sits beneath Mary.  Her lower body faces forward and left but she twists her torso to face forward, raising her right arm nearly vertically.  The figures of several nude female figures in various postures of repose surround Beatrice.  One of these kneels on her knees below Beatrice to the right, facing left and away and leaning to the right.  Another sits or kneels facing forward below and to the left of Beatrice, with bent left knee propped on a flower petal and right leg extended down to the left.  A third reclines to the left of Beatrice, facing away with her legs to the left and her torso leaning against a petal to the right.  A fourth reclines to the right of Beatrice, facing away and leaning against a petal to the left.  Figures also appear in several of the Celestial Rose's petals, particularly those forming the outer two layers. Just to the right of center, in the layer second to outermost, one petal contains a seated female figure facing left and bending her head over a tablet(?) propped in her lap.  Another, smaller figure, perhaps a cherub, hovers or flies above and to the left of her bent knees.  One or two reclining figures are loosely sketched to the right.  An angel is loosely sketched in the petal approximately second from right in the outer ring.  This figure faces forward and perhaps slightly left, wearing a gown, with its wings spread one either side of its body.  A male angel is visible in the petal approximately third from right in the outer ring.  His body faces forward, with his weight resting on his bent left knee and his right leg extended down to the left.  He twists his torso to the left and seems to raise both slightly bent arms horizontally leftward.  He may rest his hands on the frame of a harp or similar instrument that stands behind his right leg, or he may play this instrument.  His large wings are folded behind his back.  A female angel seated to the left and perhaps playing a harp is visible in the foremost petal of the outer ring, approximately fourth from right.  Her lower body faces right, but she twists forward at the waist, leaning backwards, and turns her head to look forward and left.  Her left arm is extended horizontally to the right and she may rest her left hand on a tall object, perhaps part of her instrument.  Another angel, perhaps a nude male, is visible in the petal approximately third from left in the outer ring.  He faces forward and right, and kneels or crouches with his left leg extended out in front of him and his right leg bent backwards and drawn up.  His wings are folded behind his back.  His left arm may be raised at roughly 135 degrees.  An angel, perhaps a nude male, is visible in the petal approximately second from left in the outer ring.  This angel flies, hovers, or runs facing away and slightly left with his right leg down and his left leg extended backward.  His wings are spread to either side of his body and he seems to hold his arms raised outward at 45 degrees.  Lightly sketched lines in the leftmost petal of the outer ring suggest the head and torso of at least one, but perhaps two standing figures.  Similarly, lightly sketched lines in the rightmost visible petal of the ring second to outermost suggest the heads and part of the upper bodies of two figures. Various rounded forms to the left may be more indications of figures.</illusobjdesc>

Six small satellites, perhaps moons, circle the planet.  A star appears to the right of this planet.  The third object from the left is another planet, with four satellite moons.  This planet's beams of light are visible to left and right.  The object second from right is a crescent moon.

The rod of the scepter is propped against the outside of her right elbow.  Her legs are together, and at least her right foot seems to be pointed into tiptoes.  She is dressed in a transparent gown that drapes her body but does not hide it.  Her long curly hair falls over her shoulders and a halo circles her head.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>The Virgin Mary kneels at the center of the Celestial Rose, on one of its highest petals.  A ring of tiny cherubs forms a large halo around her head.  Those at the right side of the ring are the most defined.  The cherub to the right of the hand mirror Mary holds flies or hovers facing forward and bending left, with its nude body extended diagonally down to the left.  Its wings are spread to either side of its head, which seems to be turned to the left slightly.  It may raise its arms at roughly 135 degrees.  The cherub hovering or flying just above this cherub seems to echo the position of the first, although it is less well defined.  At least three more loosely sketched cherubs complete the arch of the halo as it curls up to the left.  A very faint, loose cherub may also appear beneath the well defined cherub to the right of the hand mirror.  The cherubs that form the top of the arch are so loosely sketched as to be indistinguishable from one another.  The cherubs at the left side of the halo fly or hover facing forward with wings spread, bending right.  There may be six or seven cherubs forming this part of the arch, but they are lightly sketched and loosely defined.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>Beatrice, nude with visible breasts, sits near the center of the Celestial Rose, beneath the Virgin Mary.  The figures of several young women surround her.  One of these sits or kneels facing forward below and to the left of Beatrice.  Her bent left knee is propped on a flower petal; her slightly bent right leg is extended down to the right and her right foot seems to rest on tiptoes on a lower petal.  Her torso twists to the left slightly, and her right arm is not visible.  Her left arm is down and drawn back slightly, and her left hand lies palm down on a petal.  A few sketchy lines might indicate possible positions for her right arm.  She tilts her head back and to the right and raises her eyes.  Her mouth may be open.  She seems to be nude, although an article of clothing may drape her left thigh, and to have long hair.</illusobjdesc>

One of these is visible to the left of Beatrice, reclining and facing away.  She lies with her legs to the left and her torso leaning against a petal to the right.  Her right upper arm is raised horizontally and rests along the petal, while her left arm may lie at her side along her hip and leg.  She turns her head to the left, bending it down so that her face is visible in profile looking down and left.  Sketched rather loosely, her other details are difficult to discern, but she may wear a gown and have long hair.  There appears to be an alternative position for her head.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>The open bloom of the Celestial Rose fills much of this design.  Figures appear in several of its petals, particularly those forming the outer two layers.  A female angel seated near and perhaps playing a harp is visible in the foremost petal of the outer ring, approximately fourth from right.  Her lower body faces right, but she twists forward at the waist, leaning backwards.  She turns her head to look forward and left.  Her left arm is extended horizontally to the right and she may rest her left hand on a tall object, perhaps part of her instrument.  Her right arm is raised and bent upward to the left, and this hand may rest on a section of the instrument that crosses behind her back.  Both of her legs are bent; the right may be crossed over the left at the knee.  She seems to wear a long gown with a belted waist.  Her wings may be just visible to the left of her head.</illusobjdesc>

His left arm may be raised at roughly 135 degrees.</illusobjdesc>
