            The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of Blake's illustrations to John Milton's <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi>. This group of twelve water colors was acquired, and probably commissioned, by the Rev. Joseph Thomas in 1807. These designs, not in the Henry E. Huntington Library and Art Gallery, are presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (our image annotation program).<lb/><lb/>
            Here, as usual in his work as an illustrator of other poets' works, Blake paid close attention to the text, but this disciplined approach did not preclude his own interpretations. For example, Blake's choice of subjects places greater emphasis on Christ's role in Milton's epic than most series of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century illustrations of <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi>.<lb/><lb/>
            With this publication, the Archive contains six of Blake's nine series of water colors illustrating Milton's poetry. It is our intention to publish in the near future the remaining three series: the Butts and Linnell sets of illustrations to <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi> and the Butts set of designs for "On the Morning of Christ's Nativity."<lb/><lb/>
            As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the continuing support of the Library of Congress, and the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.

His mouth is open and he is probably speaking to the other 
               fallen angels.  A spear and round shield lean against a stone to the right of Satan.  Eight figures appear to the right of Satan; two of the most prominent figures in this group hover or leap with their 
               arms raised above their heads and look to the left toward Satan.  The figure at the bottom of this group kneels with his back to the viewer and his left hand placed palm down on the ground.  Four figures 
               bound by chains appear below Satan.  The rightmost figure lies supine with his head toward the viewer and his eyes closed.  To the left sits a figure with his legs drawn up to his chest and his arms wrapped 
               around his lower legs.  To the left, a figure kneels and is seen from behind with his left arm behind his back.  The leftmost figure on the bottom row crouches in a cave.  To the left of Satan, a nude figure hovers 
               or leaps upward.  He is seen from behind and has both arms raised above his head.  Along the left edge of the design is a figure with its arms raised vertically.  The head of a second figure appears above him.  
               To the left of Satan, a figure sits on a stone with his body twisted away from the viewer and his right leg extending to the right.  The figures are surrounded by fire, indicating hell.  
               Fire also cascades like a river or waterfall between the rocks to the left of Satan.  Coloring at the bottom of the design may represent the shore of the lake of fire described in Milton's poem.  
               Thick columns of smoke or dark clouds rise left and right of Satan.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>Satan</characteristic><characteristic>angel</characteristic><characteristic>devil</characteristic><characteristic>muscular</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>genitals</characteristic><characteristic>scales</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>arms raised at 135 degrees</characteristic><characteristic>hands raised, palms out</characteristic><characteristic>palms vertical</characteristic><characteristic>fingers spread</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>flame-like hair</characteristic><characteristic>mouth open</characteristic><characteristic>speaking</characteristic><characteristic>melancholy</characteristic><characteristic>despair</characteristic><illusobjdesc>In the center of the design, a nude and muscular Satan (a fallen angel becoming a devil) stands on a large stone.

                  probably speaking to the other figures surrounding him.

               A large bowl filled with leaves and fruit rests on the table beside a goblet or chalice and a pitcher with a looped handle.  The ground below the figures is covered with copious vegetation, including leaves and 
               flowers.  Several oak-like leaves are visible between the vegetative "legs" of the table.  Large leafy laurel plants grow left and right of the scene; rose and lily blossoms spring from these slender branches 
               that arch over the scene.  Small berries also grow among the leaves on both the left and right.  In the lower left corner of the design, a lily plant bends to the right with most of its flowers on the ground.  A rose 
               plant mirrors this in the lower right corner of the design, bending left.  In the upper center of the design in the middle distance is the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.  There are thorns on the trunk and along
