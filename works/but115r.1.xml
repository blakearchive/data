<updatestmt> 
The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of a digital edition of forty-seven monochrome wash drawings created by Blake between c. 1774 and c. 1786.  
<lb/>
<lb/>
The use of monochrome washes to tint a pencil or pen and ink drawing offered eighteenth-century artists several advantages. They could register gradations in tone, from the white of the untouched paper to jet black, without the more time-consuming use of actual colors. No further work was required if the wash drawing was intended as a preliminary for an uncolored engraving. A monochrome wash could also be used to underlie subsequent applications of water colors, thereby darkening selected areas to create the illusion of depth or cast motifs in shadow.  
<lb/>
<lb/>
As the works presented here show, Blake made full use of monochrome washes from his earliest years as an artist. When assigned by his engraving master, James Basire, to record tombs in Westminster Abbey c. 1774-75, Blake applied black and gray washes to tint many of his drawings (Objects 1-5). These carefully executed works could then be used as preliminaries for subsequent engravings by Basire’s workshop.
<lb/>
<lb/>
Blake’s monochrome washes during his first decade as an independent artist and engraver include several interrelated groups. The seven drawings of figures from Michelangelo’s Sistine ceiling (Objects 37-43) demonstrate how copying engravings of works by Renaissance masters helped Blake learn postures and gestures he would later use in his own compositions. Other drawings provide visual evidence of how Blake developed a design from early sketches to highly finished water colors or engravings. The recto/verso drawings, <hi rend="i">Two Sketches for “Joseph Making Himself Known to His Brethren”</hi> (Objects 34 and 35), are preliminaries for the finished water color in the Fitzwilliam Museum, one of three illustrations of the biblical story of Joseph that are among Blake’s finest pictorial works of the 1780s. The three Joseph water colors are in the Archive along with a water color preliminary for <hi rend="i">Joseph Ordering Simeon to be Bound</hi>. The evolution of one of Blake’s earliest original book illustrations, a frontispiece for Thomas Commins’ <hi rend="i">Elegy Set to Music</hi> of 1786, can be traced through three variant wash drawings (Objects 45-47) and a pencil sketch also in the Archive. The four wash versions of <hi rend="i">The Good Farmer</hi> reproduced here (Objects 16-19), in addition to two pen and ink drawings of the subject previously added to the Archive, show the complex ways Blake played variations on a theme as he worked toward a final version. No such finished work is known, and thus these drawings are our only record of Blake’s engagement with this subject. Similarly, for <hi rend="i">War Unchained by an Angel, Fire, Pestilence, and Famine Following</hi>, an untraced work Blake exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1784, we have only a preliminary study (Object 6).
<lb/>
<lb/>
Blake’s illustrations to his poem <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> of c. 1789 are among his most accomplished monochrome wash drawings. These have been published in the Archive as an independent group coordinated with the <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> manuscript.

                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>Alternatively titled "The Resurrection of the Dead," this design portrays the biblical scene of Numbers 16:46-50, where Aaron makes atonement for the people and stops the plague. Here, though, the principle figure is identified as Moses. In the design's center, Moses(?) stands erect with his arms raised above his head at approximately 135 degrees. He wears a floor-length, long-sleeved gown that may have an additional cloth draping across from his right shoulder toward his left foot; his right foot appears below the gown's hem. Moses has dark, curly hair and a beard of similar color and texture. His body faces the viewer, but his head turns to the left as he gazes in that direction. Moses's outstretched arms point toward the upper corners of the design, and his palms face downward. His mouth appears to be open, and he may be speaking. Moses raises a number of recumbent or semi-recumbent figures who gaze upward toward the right where beams of light emerge from behind a cloud in the upper right-hand corner of the design. Seven of the figures are more clearly defined in the design's foreground. All of these figures appear to be male, and are nude with short, curly hair. The six behind Moses are, from left to right: a man who crouches or sits with his arms and eyes raised in a posture of supplication; a man who reclines with his knee(s) bent, his right arm on the ground to support him, and his left arm raised toward the sun; a man who reclines on his right side, facing the viewer but turning his head to face the sun; a dead or dying man who lies supine with his head facing skyward and his eyes closed; a man at right of Moses who leans on his extended right arm and turns to gaze upward and to the left, toward the sun; and a possibly dead or dying man who lies on his left side with his head down. In front and to the right of Moses, facing away from the viewer, is a muscular male figure who leans to the right and supports himself with his extended right arm. His legs extend to the left, and his left arm extends upward toward the sun with his palm turned to face the viewer. In the left part of the design, the outline of a cliff or other landscape feature appears in the design's background. Lines suggest the presence of another land form at right, below the clouds. The ground beneath the figures appears to be bare.</illusobjdesc>

He bends his right knee upward; his left leg may be bent or extended. The man supports himself with his bent right arm and his palm, which is on the ground by his right hip. He extends his left arm toward the sun, and his head and eyes follow as he looks upward.</illusobjdesc>
