                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>Alternatively titled "The Resurrection of the Dead," this design portrays the biblical scene of Numbers 16:46-50, where Aaron makes atonement for the people and stops the plague. Here, though, the principle figure is identified as Moses. In the design's center, Moses(?) stands erect with his arms raised above his head at approximately 135 degrees. He wears a floor-length, long-sleeved gown that may have an additional cloth draping across from his right shoulder toward his left foot; his right foot appears below the gown's hem. Moses has dark, curly hair and a beard of similar color and texture. His body faces the viewer, but his head turns to the left as he gazes in that direction. Moses's outstretched arms point toward the upper corners of the design, and his palms face downward. His mouth appears to be open, and he may be speaking. Moses raises a number of recumbent or semi-recumbent figures who gaze upward toward the right where beams of light emerge from behind a cloud in the upper right-hand corner of the design. Seven of the figures are more clearly defined in the design's foreground. All of these figures appear to be male, and are nude with short, curly hair. The six behind Moses are, from left to right: a man who crouches or sits with his arms and eyes raised in a posture of supplication; a man who reclines with his knee(s) bent, his right arm on the ground to support him, and his left arm raised toward the sun; a man who reclines on his right side, facing the viewer but turning his head to face the sun; a dead or dying man who lies supine with his head facing skyward and his eyes closed; a man at right of Moses who leans on his extended right arm and turns to gaze upward and to the left, toward the sun; and a possibly dead or dying man who lies on his left side with his head down. In front and to the right of Moses, facing away from the viewer, is a muscular male figure who leans to the right and supports himself with his extended right arm. His legs extend to the left, and his left arm extends upward toward the sun with his palm turned to face the viewer. In the left part of the design, the outline of a cliff or other landscape feature appears in the design's background. Lines suggest the presence of another land form at right, below the clouds. The ground beneath the figures appears to be bare.</illusobjdesc>

He bends his right knee upward; his left leg may be bent or extended. The man supports himself with his bent right arm and his palm, which is on the ground by his right hip. He extends his left arm toward the sun, and his head and eyes follow as he looks upward.</illusobjdesc>
