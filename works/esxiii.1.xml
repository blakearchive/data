                The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of fully searchable and scalable electronic editions of the following works related to Blake’s development of his illustrations to Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>: Preliminary Sketches for Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, listed under Drawings and Paintings, Pencil Sketches; Preliminary Drawings for Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, listed under Drawings and Paintings, Monochrome Wash Drawings; and Preliminary Illustrations to Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, listed under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.<lb/><lb/>
                In addition, we are republishing the following works, previously presented in our Preview mode, to make their designs fully searchable: Robert Blair, <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, the 1808 book listed under Commercial Book Illustrations, Designed by Blake and Engraved by Other Engravers; <hi rend="i">Deaths Door</hi>, listed under Separate Plates and Plates in Series, Designed and Engraved by Blake; and Illustrations to Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, the series of twenty finished designs, listed under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.<lb/><lb/>
                Taken together, these works in a variety of media present a comprehensive overview of one of Blake’s major projects as an illustrator and exemplify his working methods as he developed rough sketches into finished water colors.  The evolution of any one design can be traced via links presented under Related Works in the Archive on the pull-down menus, lower left on the main viewing page for each work. <lb/><lb/>
                In October 1805, Blake was commissioned by the engraver and would-be publisher Robert H. Cromek to prepare forty drawings illustrating Robert Blair's <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, a popular "Graveyard" school poem first published in 1743.  Cromek originally planned to select twenty of these designs for a deluxe edition of the poem.  Blake launched into the project with great enthusiasm, rapidly sketching out his illustrations in pencil, developing some into wash drawings, and then producing a group of more finished water colors for presentation to Cromek.  In a first prospectus of November 1805, Cromek names Blake as both the designer and engraver of fifteen designs.  Blake etched one image, <hi rend="i">Deaths Door</hi>, in white-line, but Cromek rejected it.  The dark power of the print appeals to modern tastes, but was far from fashionable in the early nineteenth century.  In a second prospectus, also of November 1805, Cromek announced that Louis Schiavonetti would engrave twelve designs for the new edition.  Blake had lost the potentially lucrative commission to engrave his own designs; his relationship with Cromek descended into anger and argument.  In spite of their disagreement, Cromek included a portrait of Blake as a frontispiece to the volume, published in 1808.  Cromek promoted the book aggressively and the illustrations to <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> became Blake's best known work through much of the nineteenth century. <lb/><lb/>

The doorway is framed by two pillars supporting a lintel and a single step below. There may be a path or road below the tomb, along the lower border of the image. Leafy vegetation appears in the lower right portion of the design, to the right of the right-hand pillar of the door. There is also a plant or vine with spiny leaves and thorns to the left of the left-hand pillar, grass and perhaps leafy plants above the door on the right side of the hill, and grass and perhaps leafy plants above the door on the left side of the hill. The door to the tomb is open. The door has a whorled texture that may indicate wood, and is crossed horizontally and vertically by bands of a different texture (iron?). A dark knocker or handle in the shape of a ring appears in the center of the door, hanging from a securement of a lighter color. The interior of the tomb is dark. A woven mat, possibly made of straw, rests on a bier, bed, or raised platform in the lower right corner of the tomb, but these are far less distinct than in other versions of the image. Vertical and horizontal lines just above the mat may indicate that the back wall of the tomb is made of bricks or stones cut at right angles. An old man with long hair and a beard stands in the lower portion of the design. The figure wears a belted gown and faces right in profile. His right leg is bent with his right heel raised slightly. His left leg is not pictured, but he likely steps up into the doorway. The figure is hunched over and leans on a crutch positioned under his right arm. The figure's right arm is bent at his side and he may hold or touch the crutch with his right hand. The old man's long hair streams out to the right, as though blown by a wind. A nude male with short curly hair sits or kneels above the tomb. The figure faces forward with his head turned up and to the left in profile. His mouth is open and his left eye is raised. Both legs are bent; his right knee is on the ground and his left leg is drawn up. The figure's right arm is at his side and his right hand is not visible. His left arm is bent back; his hand rests on the ground with the palm down and he may be bracing or supporting himself. An aura surrounds the upper half of the figure; beams of light radiate outward. Alternatively, the figure may be positioned in front of the sun at sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc><component type="structure" location="E"><characteristic>tomb</characteristic><characteristic>hill</characteristic><characteristic>stone</characteristic><characteristic>step</characteristic><characteristic>pillar</characteristic><characteristic>lintel</characteristic><characteristic>door</characteristic><characteristic>iron</characteristic><characteristic>wood</characteristic><characteristic>open</characteristic><characteristic>hinge</characteristic><characteristic>circle</characteristic><characteristic>ring</characteristic><characteristic>handle</characteristic><characteristic>dark</characteristic><characteristic>bed</characteristic><characteristic>bier</characteristic><characteristic>mat</characteristic><characteristic>straw</characteristic><characteristic>coil</characteristic><characteristic>coiled</characteristic><characteristic>brick</characteristic><characteristic>road</characteristic><characteristic>path</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A tomb is built into a large stone or hill in the lower portion of the design.
