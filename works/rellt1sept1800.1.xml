                    Baron Coleridge) at an unknown time; acquired from Lord Coleridge by private
                    treaty in December 1997 by Robert Essick, John Windle acting as agent. This
                    letter was brought to the attention of Morton D. Paley by Lord Coleridge in the
                    summer of 1997.</note></provenance><repository><institution>Collection of Robert N.
