      <seriesstmt>The William Blake Archive</seriesstmt>
      <updatestmt>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of 20 of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible. These designs illustrate the Old Testament and are arranged according to the passages illustrated.  They are presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).
            
        <lb/>
        <lb/>
        The Bible had an enormous influence on Blake’s work as both artist and poet.  Among his many and complex responses to that text are water color drawings.  The present group of 20 is selected from a sequence of about 80 biblical water colors of similar size Blake painted for Thomas Butts between c. 1800 and 1805.  These designs emphasize interactions between the human and the divine.  In works such as 
        <hi rend="i">Ezekiel’s Wheels</hi>
        and 
        <hi rend="i">David Delivered Out of Many Waters</hi>
        , the interaction is revelatory or redemptive.  In other designs, including 
        <hi rend="i">Pestilence: The Death of the First-Born</hi>
        , the relationship between God and humankind devolves into punishment and destruction.
            
        <lb/>
        <lb/>
        This group of 20 water colors is the first installment in our publication of a large selection of Blake’s water color drawings illustrating the Bible.  In coming months we will publish a group of New Testament illustrations also from the series executed for Butts.  Later we will add early works, such as 
        <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>
        , datable to c. 1780, and continue through Blake’s final biblical water colors, including 
        <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi>
        of c. 1824.

          <illusobjdesc>This design illustrates Potiphar's wife accusing Joseph of attempted rape, Genesis 39:7-20. In the center of the design stands Potiphar's wife, facing left and slightly forward. Her gown swirls at the hem to indicate rapid movement, striding or walking to the left. She has long hair pulled up in a bun, with a band in her hair. Her legs are bent, with her left leg extended slightly backward and left foot on tiptoe. Her right arm is raised horizontally and she points at Joseph. Her left arm is raised at 135 degrees, and in that hand she holds a cloth or garment. Her mouth is open (she is probably speaking) and she looks upward at her husband. To the left of Potiphar's wife stands a man, facing forward and to the left—presumably Potiphar himself. Potiphar has curly hair and a beard. He wears a gown and possibly a long cloak or robe. He stands with his right arm bent and held to his chest and his left arm at his side. His mouth is slightly open. His facial expression suggests surprise. To the left of Potiphar stands Joseph, facing right and slightly forward. He stands, partly clothed in a toga-like gown. His right arm is at his side, palm down. Joseph has short, curly hair and looks at Potiphar's wife with his mouth slightly open. His facial expression suggests surprise. Three female servants observe this scene. The leftmost female stands to the left of Joseph. She has curly hair and wears a gown. The lower half of her body faces left, but she twists to look forward and to the right. Her left leg is bent and on tiptoe, as though she is in mid-stride. Her arms are bent and she balances on her head a wicker basket full of grapes in bunches, with their leaves still attached. The middle female servant stands between Potiphar and his wife. She has curly hair and wears a gown. She faces forward and slightly left, as though looking at Joseph. Her right leg is extended forward, as though she is in mid-stride. The rightmost female servant stands to the right of Potiphar's wife. She has curly hair and wears a gown. She faces forward and left, as if looking at Joseph. Her right arm is at her side, palm down. This scene takes place in a well-lit room, judging from the shadows visible on the floor. In the background a wall is visible through an open doorway. Two pyramids are visible through the doorway. The sky, as seen through the doorway, has a few clouds.</illusobjdesc>

His facial expression suggests surprise.</illusobjdesc>
