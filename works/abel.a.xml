            The editors of the William Blake Archive http://www.iath.virginia/edu/blake are pleased to announce the publication of four new electronic editions of Blake's illuminated books. They are: <hi rend="i">The Ghost of Abel</hi> Copy A (The Library of Congress), <hi rend="i">On Homers Poetry [and] On Virgil</hi> Copies B (The Fitzwilliam Museum) and F (The Pierpont Morgan Library), <hi rend="i">Laocoön</hi> Copy B (collection of Robert N. Essick).<lb/><lb/>
            These three works are Blake's final illuminated books, their composition dateable between 1822 (<hi rend="i">The Ghost of Abel</hi>, <hi rend="i">On Homers Poetry [and] On Virgil</hi>) and c. 1826-27 (<hi rend="i">Laocoön</hi>). In the words of Sir Geoffrey Keynes, they offer Blake's "Last Testament" on subjects ranging from aesthetic theory to political economy, from forgiveness to apocalyptic judgment. A drama in miniature, <hi rend="i">The Ghost of Abel</hi> addresses "Lord Byron in the Wilderness" (Plate 1) and, more specifically, the issues of vengeance and forgiveness raised by Byron's <hi rend="i">Cain: A Mystery</hi> (1821). The broadsheet <hi rend="i">On Homers Poetry [and] On Virgil</hi> challenges these representative figures of classical learning, with special emphasis on concepts of unity as an artistic ideal, identity, and the destructive consequences of imperialism. There are five copies extant for each of these works, which, like most of Blake's illuminated books, were produced in relief etching; the <hi rend="i">Laocoön</hi> plate, which is an intaglio etching/engraving, is extant in two copies. Through a careful representation and restoration of the famous Hellenistic sculptural group, Blake attempts to return the Laocoön to its supposed Hebraic origins and its allegorical meanings, revealed by the terse yet intellectually expansive texts with which Blake surrounds the central image.<lb/><lb/>
            All of these editions have newly edited SGML-encoded texts and are all fully searchable for both text and images and supported by the unique Inote and ImageSizer applications described in our previous updates. We now have twenty-six copies of sixteen illuminated books in the Archive. Late this year and early in the next, we will add <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> Copy D and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> Copy E. We will also be adding at least six more copies of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi>, two copies of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi>, five copies of <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>, four copies of <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen</hi>, and two copies each of <hi rend="i">America, a Prophecy</hi> and <hi rend="i">Europe, a Prophecy</hi>. In addition, by the end of 1998 we will provide a fully-searchable SGML edition of David V. Erdman's <hi rend="i">Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</hi>.<lb/><lb/>
            In the coming weeks we will also be opening a brand-new wing of the Archive, consisting of an extensive array of supporting materials: an updated and expanded Plan of the Archive, a statement of Editorial Principles and Methodology, a summary of the Archive's technical design and implementation, a list of Frequently Asked Questions, an in-depth illustrated Tour highlighting the Archive's features and some ways to use its resources, and more. Our hope is that these extensive documentary materials will prove valuable both to our own growing user community as well as to scholars interested in the theory and practice of electronic editing more generally. We will make a separate announcement when these materials are available on the site.<lb/><lb/>
            Finally, on our recently opened Contributing Collections page, we plan to begin adding color-coded and linked lists of each institution's entire Blake collection to indicate what is and is not in the Archive and what is forthcoming. In addition to providing a convenient index of the scope and contents of the Archive, these lists should also be useful to scholars in planning research trips.

plate (line 1).  Two gowned adult figures, perhaps a male (on the left) and
a female (right of the male) hover in the top left corner of the
plate.  The male, facing right, seems to have his arms raised
horizontally; the hem of his garment forms a snake-like tail.  The
female, facing right, has her arms raised horizontally and holds,
or reaches for, an infant or child.  This tiny figure probably
faces to the right, with legs spread and at least one arm raised
horizontally.  He or she may be fleeing the adult female.  On the
right side of the plate, several figures surround "Abel" in the
title (line 1).  Slight indications of a figure facing left appear to the
right of, and probably lean against, the first diagonal of "A."  A
figure, facing left, walks on top of the "B."  At least one arm is
extended horizontally and seems to be reaching for a hovering child
or infant, facing right (toward the walking adult) with at least
one arm raised horizontally.  A figure kneels or sits on top of the
"E," facing right and with at least one arm extended at 45 degrees. 
A very small figure, perhaps an infant or putto, hovers between the
"E" and "L."  This figure faces right, with legs spread and perhaps
one arm raised at 135 degrees.  A figure, apparently facing
forward, sits or squats on the foot of the "L" with the left arm
raised vertically.  He or she may be reaching toward the extended
arm of the gowned and standing figure to the right.  This figure
faces left and has both arms raised horizontally.  This group of
two figures on and just following the "L" suggests the raising of
Lazarus by Christ.  A group of three or four figures hovers in the
top right corner of the plate.  These are, from left to right,
slight indications (clearer in other impressions) of a standing
figure facing left with most of his or her body covered by the next
figure described here; a (nude and female?) figure facing forward;
a (nude and male?) figure facing forward but twisting to the right
with arms raised to the right at 135 degrees; and a gowned figure
seen from behind.  The second and third of these figures are close
together; they may be Adam and Eve.  Beneath "A Revelation" (line 2) in the
subtitle, a lion pursues a fleeing and leaping stag; both face
right.  Between them are some vague forms that may be the trunks of
trees.  Under "Jehovah" (line 2), the last word in the subtitle, we see two
running figures, the one on the right pursuing the fleeing figure
to the left.  These human figures, facing left and both apparently
nude, are clearly a parallel to the lion and stag on the left side
of the plate.  The left figure, perhaps Cain, has his legs spread
apart in a dramatic stride to the left.  His left leg is bent at
the knee and the right leg is extended backward.  His left arm is
bent upward; he clutches his lowered head (in despair?) with at
least his left hand.  The right leg of the pursuing figure, perhaps
a vengeful God, is bent dramatically at the knee; the left leg is
extended backward.  His arms are raised horizontally, with the
raised hands palms out.  It has also been suggested that these two
figures are Cain pursuing Abel to murder him; indeed, there may be
an object of some sort (a knife?) in the left hand of the pursuing
figure.  Vines with thorns grows right of "Blake" (line 3); one extends to
the left under "Seen by William Blake."  Four birds fly above the
first three words of line 6 of the text; two or three more appear
after the first word ("Adam") of line 13 and another two after the word "Jehovah" in line 15.  Slight marks above "Eve"
(line 9), "Grave" (line 10), and between "her" and
"Jehovah" (end of line 10) may also be birds in flight.  A vine or
plant with leaves appears in the right margin, right of lines 6-7
of the text.  The first letter of "Scene," the first word in line
9 of the text, grows into vines at both ends.  The vine extending
from this letter toward the left margin of the plate bears two
standing figures, apparently facing each other.  The left-most
figure has at least one arm raised horizontally.  Below "of Abel"
at the start of line 10 of the text is a comet (with tail) or a
shooting star.  Further to the right below the same line are
flames.  Under the same line of text and further to the right are
two figures—probably the dead body of Abel (lying supine on the
left) and Cain (fleeing on the right).  Both appear to be nude. 
Abel's arms are extended horizontally; his right leg is bent at the
knee and perhaps crossed over his extended left leg.  Cain, who we
see from the back, strides energetically to the right, with his
right leg bent sharply at the knee and his left leg extended
backward.  He seems to be looking back at his brother.  Both arms
are raised horizontally; he may be holding a knife in one of his
hands.  A gowned figure hovers, body horizontal, below "Adam" at
the start of line 13 of the text.  The figure's head is on the left
with at least one arm extended horizontally to the left.  A group
of three (gowned?) figures, arms raised horizontally, hovers under
"Is this Death?," in line 14 of the text.  We see a vine or branch with
one (oak?) leaf and several fruit right of line 14.  Beneath the
last four letters of line 13 is a snake, with its coiling tail on
the right and its crested head, mouth open with tongue extended, on
the left.  This may be Satan in his serpent form.</illusobjdesc><component type="object" location="AB"><characteristic>cloud</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Cloud outlines surround the title (line 1) at the top of the

features three vignettes.  Left of lines 17-21 of the text are two
nude figures, almost certainly Eve (seen from behind on the left)
and Adam (facing forward), as the inscriptions above and below the
vignette indicate.  Both have their legs crossed and stand in a
contrapposto posture.  Between them is a tree—probably the Tree of
Life or the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil—with several
branches bearing large fruit.  Lower right in the vignette, a vine
with thorns grows upward and turns to the right below line 19 of
the text.  The vignette left of lines 28-31 of the text shows a
figure lying supine on the ground, with the upper body raised,
facing right, and perhaps leaning against the tree trunk on the
left.  This is probably Eve, who hears the voice of the dead Abel. 
This voice (or ghost) is pictured as the hovering figure above,
just below the word "Abel" (line 28) inscribed above the vignette.  His body
is horizontal, with his head on the left and at least one arm
extended horizontally.  Below him, and right of Eve's feet, is a
plant or small tree with several branches.  The final vignette,
left of lines 37-40 of the text, again pictures a nude Adam (on the
right?) and Eve standing with a tree between them.  Its branches
are now bear.  Eve, facing forward, stands in a contrapposto
posture with legs crossed at the ankles.  Her left arm is raised
horizontally and she may be touching the left arm (bent upwards) of
Adam—or giving him a fruit from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good
and Evil.  He is seen from behind, but he twists to the left.  His
legs are slightly spread, as though he were striding to the right

landscape with dark clouds in the sky.  A figure, probably the dead
Abel, lies supine on the ground.  We see only his head on the left
and the right side of his torso because another figure is lying
over him.  Although muscular, and identified by some scholars as
either Cain or Adam, this prone figure with long, slightly curly
hair is more probably Eve grieving or fainting (see Plate 1, lines
5-6) over her dead son.  Her left arm is extended
horizontally and her legs are crossed at the ankles.  She wears a
skirt over her loins and thighs, perhaps made of an animal (sheep?)
skin with prominent fur or wool.  Above this pair is a male figure,
apparently nude, hovering horizontally in the sky.  As the
inscription on his right leg indicates, this is "The Voice of Abels
Blood" (lines 34-35).  His mouth is open and he may be speaking; his face
suggests a mixture of anger and despair.  His arms are crossed over
his chest and wrapped around his body.  The index finger of his
left hand points to the inscription on his body.  He faces forward,
legs together, with his head twisted to the left; his hair is
slightly curly and seems to be blown to the left by a wind.  Smoke

vignettes.  Left of lines 1-2 is a gowned figure, hunched over at
the waist and apparently walking to the left.  A flock of five
birds surrounds the figure.  She or he holds a large object in at
least the left arm (reaching downward) and hand.  The figure has
been identified as Eve, although he might be Adam (the name
inscribed just below the vignette).  The object he or she carries
has been described as a book, Abel's coffin, and the stone tablets
of the decalogue.  The vignette left of lines 6-10 shows two
figures.  On the far left, a figure sits on a bed or drapery-
covered stool.  He or she is twisted, with the upper body facing
forward but the head and arms facing to the right.  The left arm is
raised horizontally, with the right arm bent and the forearm raised
horizontally.  Both hands may be pushing against the figure to the
right.  This seated figure has been identified as Eve or God
("Jehovah" is inscribed beneath the vignette [line 11]) being rejected by the
figure to the right.  The figure on the right, probably a nude male
seen from behind, has his left (trailing) leg bent and extended
backward.  He has generally been identified as Abel (or his soul). 
His left arm is raised horizontally, with the left hand touching,
perhaps pushing against, the head of the seated figure to the left. 
The running figure's right arm is bent upward over his head.  We
see a hovering, gowned figure, body horizontal, left of line 14. 
He or she faces left and has at least the left arm raised at 45
degrees.  This might be the soul or ghost of Abel.  A flock of
eleven birds surrounds the human figure.  The vignette left of
lines 17-21 pictures two nude (male?) figures.  The right-most
figure in the group, seen from behind, hovers above the other with
legs together and bent at the knees.  His arms are bent upward,
with hands raised palms up.  He leans to the left and may be
looking at the figure below.  He is seated (on a mound of earth or
stone?).  He faces forward, but his head is twisted to the right. 
His arms and hands are in much the same position as his
companion's.  His legs are crossed at the ankles.  These figures
have been identified as God (seated) arguing or contending with
Satan (see "Satan" and "Jehovah" inscribed immediately above and
below this vignette [lines 16, 22]).  The final vignette, left of lines 23-27,
pictures two nude figures standing on either side of a tree with a
large, thick trunk.  A few branches extend from the top of the
tree; one branch, descending on the right side of the vignette,
bears fruit.  This is almost certainly the Tree of the Knowledge of
Good and Evil, with the spiral form encircling it representing the
body of Satan in his serpent form.  The figure on the left, legs
together, is facing forward.  This is probably Adam, perhaps with
his arms drawn back behind his back.  On the right, we see Eve from
behind, perhaps with her legs crossed at the ankles.  A vine
appears to spring from Eve's lower legs; it extends horizontally
above the first three words of line 27 of the text.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="A"><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>Eve</characteristic><characteristic>Adam</characteristic><characteristic>walking</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>hunched over</characteristic><characteristic>bending forward</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>carrying</characteristic><characteristic>arm reaching downward</characteristic><characteristic>book</characteristic><characteristic>coffin</characteristic><characteristic>decalogue</characteristic><characteristic>stone</characteristic><characteristic>tablet</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The vignette left of lines 1-2 of the text shows a
