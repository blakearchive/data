            The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of electronic editions of <hi rend="i">The Song of Los</hi>, Copies A and D. Both have been in the collection of the British Museum since the mid-nineteenth century; they join Copy B from the Library of Congress, previously published in the Archive. Like all six extant copies of <hi rend="i">The Song of Los</hi>, A and D were richly color printed in 1795. With its divisions into sections titled "Africa" and "Asia," <hi rend="i">The Song of Los</hi> follows <hi rend="i">America</hi> (1793) and <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> (1794) as the last of Blake's "Continental Prophecies" that mingle contemporary events with a host of mythological motifs, both borrowed and invented.<lb/><lb/>
            As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible through the continuing support of the Library of Congress, the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia, by a major grant from the Preservation and Access Division of the National Endowment for the Humanities, by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and by the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.

his face.  He faces and looks up, with his legs extended to the

Moses, Adam, and Noah--see "And Noah as white as snow / On the

Adam, a mouldering skeleton / Lay bleach'd on the garden of Eden" 
(Plate 7, lines 20-21).  The background behind and above the figure may be hills 
(covered with indeterminate vegetation) closest to the figure, 
and either more distant hills or waves of the sea in the far 
background.  The spiky forms, colored red, could be flames.  Above, in the sky, are four birds in flight with 
extended wings: a bird (poorly printed in this copy) right of "THE" in the title (line 1), and three

heading ("AFRICA," line 1).  The snake's head points down and its mouth 
is open; its forked tongue hangs down.  The reptilian theme is 
continued by a small lizard, apparently climbing the first 
diagonal of the first "A" in the heading.  Many vines, some with 
loops and spirals (far left), and a few leaves also play about 
and are intertwined with the heading.  Several flying insects, 
perhaps moths or butterflies, are also pictured, particularly 
below the first "A" and the "F" of the heading and just left of, above, and below the final "A."  Below, with five lines of text intervening, is the lower half of 
what is probably a unified composition, particularly given the 
marginal vegetation linking them.  On the left is a nude young 
male, probably a shepherd boy, lying on the ground in a 
contracted posture and probably sleeping.  The downward-directed 
mouth of the serpent above may be threatening him.  The male's 
legs are drawn up and his head, with curly hair, rests face down 
on his left arm.  To the right is at least one sheep, also lying 
on the ground with its face on the left.  Further to the right 
may be more sheep plus some vegetation.  Above this area, and 
just below the final word of line 3, is a flying 
                  insect with bat-like wings.

text areas representing clouds in the sky.  On the earth below 
the text, an embracing couple runs to the right.  These are 
probably Har and Heva, who "fled" from the "War &amp; Lust" of "their 
brethren" (lines 5-6).  They face forward, but may be looking back to 
the left.  Both faces express fear or horror.  The male is nude.  Both figures have their mouths open, as though speaking or uttering a 
cry.  The female wears a skirt but would appear to be undraped 
above the waist.  The female's hair is long, the man's curly.  
They appear to be fleeing from some unrepresented presence on the 
left.  The man's left arm holds the woman's waist; his right arm 
may be behind her back with his right hand visible just below her 
right upper arm.  The woman's left arm is wrapped around the 
man's head.  Her right arm is extended at 135 degrees, with the 
palm facing to the left as though fending off a pursuer.  The 
ground on which they run may be covered with low vegetation.  A 
hill or mound of vegetation rises on the right; behind and above the figures is a dark sky, but with red streaks just above the horizon and a red mountain-like formation on the right.  Just 
above, in the cloud or text panel into which the woman's right 
arm extends, are two birds with wings extended.  The entire scene 
is apocalyptic.  Above, on the upper cloud or text panel, is a 
nude human figure, probably male, hovering in the air.  We see 
him from behind, with one leg drawn up and the other extended.  
He faces to the left, with his arms extended horizontally.  His

The ground from 
which the lily plant grows is not clearly represented, but there 
may be a river behind its stems.  If we assume that this is a 
plant of normal size, then the human figures are diminutive, 
perhaps fairies.  The female, wearing a gown that seemingly does 
not cover her left shoulder and breast, lies on one blossom with eyes 
closed; she may be asleep.  Her head rests on her right arm and 
hand.  Her hair is long.  The male wears a long gown and a 
separate cloak.  He is crowned, and thus probably a king; by 
association, the woman may be a queen.  His eyes are open and he 
faces forward.  He has long hair and a beard.  He is more seated than lying on his blossom, with 
his upper body propped up with his right arm.  He holds a scepter 
in his left hand.  The night sky in the distance contains indications of stars.  The design is based loosely on a 
monochrome wash drawing, now usually attributed to Blake's 
brother Robert, in Blake's Notebook, page 5.  There is also a 
separate water color of the design by William Blake (private 
collection).  The two figures have traditionally been identified 
as Oberon and Titania, although the relevance of Shakespeare's <hi rend="i">A 
Midsummer Night's Dream</hi> to <hi rend="i"> is not immediately 
apparent.  Other critics have identified the figures as Har and 
Heva, as on Plate 4.  Perhaps, given the cosmic scale of Plate 8, this plate represents the microscopic world of the Blakean 
imagination.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="B"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>cloak</characteristic><characteristic>reclining</characteristic><characteristic>sitting</characteristic><characteristic>leg dangling</characteristic><characteristic>leg drawn up</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>arm braced</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>scepter</characteristic><characteristic>crown</characteristic><characteristic>arm at side</characteristic><characteristic>fairy</characteristic><characteristic>king</characteristic><characteristic>Har</characteristic><characteristic>Oberon</characteristic></hi><illusobjdesc>A male figure, wearing a gown and a separate cloak,

would seem to be treated as a single, interrelated pictorial 
image.  Several figures, not very clearly defined, disport among 
the letters of the heading ("ASIA," line 1).  A seated figure, with at least the left leg drawn up, appears just left of the first letter.  His head may be bent back or turned to the right.  Within the upper 
loop of the second letter, a figure clutches his head and falls 
head first.  In the lower part of this same letter, there may be a gowned figure hunched over and with its hands clutching its head.  Two embracing(?) figures, poorly defined but probably a 
male and female, stride to the left just left of the lower part 
of the letter "I."  An ill-defined cluster of lines may be a 
seated figure at the lower parts of the final "A."  The sky 
behind the heading contains clouds; the yellow and pink coloring behind the heading suggests a sunrise or sunset.  Below, we see a great 
tree arching over from left to right.  In a cave-like niche below 
the tree are two figures, a nude male holding a gowned woman.  He 
squats or sits on the ground, apparently with his head lowered 
since we see only the curly hair on the top of his head.  The 
female's head and left arm fall downward; she may be dead. 
The dark green coloring to the left of the man and woman may be vegetation.
Undifferentiated vegetation continues down both margins of the 
text; some vine-like shapes intrude between lines of text and 
fill areas on the right of the text.  A nude figure, probably male, sits or kneels in an extremely 
contracted posture in the lower right corner of the plate.  His 
left leg is drawn up to his left shoulder.  His head is turned to
