    The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of thirty-three of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible.  All take their subjects from the New Testament and have been added to the twenty Old Testament subjects published in March 2010 as “Illustrations to the Bible, c. 1780-1824,” under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.  This new group is presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).
                <lb/><lb/>
                   Blake executed most of these New Testament water colors c. 1800-05 for his patron Thomas Butts.  The exceptions are <hi rend="i">The Whore of Babylon</hi> of 1809 and <hi rend="i">The Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins</hi> in the Yale Center for British Art, datable to c. 1825. The subjects range from the childhood of Jesus to his ascension, the later history of his parents and one of his major followers, St. Paul, and a group of eight designs based on the Book of Revelation.  While the illustrations of the life of Christ are fairly conventional in their subjects, in part because of the long tradition of picturing almost every event in the Gospels, individual motifs recall designs in Blake’s illuminated books and thus offer a window on Blake’s visual interpretation of the Bible. The illustrations of Revelation complement Blake’s intense engagement with apocalyptic events and images in his own poetry.
                    <lb/><lb/>
                        The selection of fifty-three biblical water colors now available in the Archive will be supplemented in the future with early works, such as <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>, datable to c. 1780, and will continue through Blake’s final biblical water colors, such as <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi>. 
                    <lb/><lb/>

At the bottom center of the design lies Jesus, supine, in a shroud that covers all but his face. His beard is visible, and his eyes are closed. His arms are at his side. Jesus lies on a pillow and a mattress or slab of stone. To the left of Jesus's body kneel two figures. The frontmost figure is that of a gowned old man with long hair and a beard. He, or the bearded figure above, may be Joseph of Arimathea (see Luke 23:50-51). He faces right and down, looking at Jesus's body. His legs are bent under him and his arms are raised horizontally and bent slightly. He may be arranging Jesus's body or its coverings. The rear figure also faces right and down, hunching over slightly, and appears to have long hair and be gowned. In the middle ground in the center of the design sit three containers, perhaps a covered bowl in the middle with a vial or glass on either side. On the left side of the middle ground stand three gowned figures. The leftmost figure faces left and down and is only visible as the top of a head. The middle figure is that of a man with long hair and a beard. He, or the bearded figure below, may be Joseph of Arimathea (see Luke 23:50-51). He faces right and down, looking at Jesus's body. His arms are bent with his hands together as though in prayer or supplication. The rightmost figure stands, facing forward and down slightly. Its gender is indeterminable. It is hooded, and covers its face with its upward bent arm. On the right in the middle ground stand at least five figures, facing left and down. The leftmost figure is that of a young woman with long, wavy hair. She is gowned and faces forward slightly, looking at Jesus. We see only the hair of the next figure to the right. The frontmost figure is gowned and hooded, and of indeterminable gender. Its face is not visible and its arms may be crossed. The figure just above may be that of a male with short, curly hair, but is only visible as the top of a head facing slightly forward. The rightmost figure is that of a gowned and mostly bald male, who may have his eyes closed. In the center background, three gowned female figures stand in a doorward, facing forward and looking down. The leftmost woman has long, curly hair over which she wears a veil. She faces left slightly and may cross her arms upward across her chest. The middle figure has long, curly hair and bends her left arm upward, with her hand on her face. This is probably the Virgin Mary. She may be crying. Her right arm is at her side but bent slightly. Her left foot protrudes from beneath the hem of her gown, which may indicate that she is walking. In her right hand she holds a large lit candle. The rightmost figure has a veil over her hair and faces right slightly. Her arms are crossed. The left and right women are probably Mary Magdalene and Mary, the wife of Cleophas. The scene takes place in a shadowy tomb with an open arched doorway, from which two steps lead downward. Through the arch in the background, dark trees and clouds are visible against the night sky.
