    The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of thirty-three of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible.  All take their subjects from the New Testament and have been added to the twenty Old Testament subjects published in March 2010 as “Illustrations to the Bible, c. 1780-1824,” under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.  This new group is presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).
                <lb/><lb/>
                   Blake executed most of these New Testament water colors c. 1800-05 for his patron Thomas Butts.  The exceptions are <hi rend="i">The Whore of Babylon</hi> of 1809 and <hi rend="i">The Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins</hi> in the Yale Center for British Art, datable to c. 1825. The subjects range from the childhood of Jesus to his ascension, the later history of his parents and one of his major followers, St. Paul, and a group of eight designs based on the Book of Revelation.  While the illustrations of the life of Christ are fairly conventional in their subjects, in part because of the long tradition of picturing almost every event in the Gospels, individual motifs recall designs in Blake’s illuminated books and thus offer a window on Blake’s visual interpretation of the Bible. The illustrations of Revelation complement Blake’s intense engagement with apocalyptic events and images in his own poetry.
                    <lb/><lb/>
                        The selection of fifty-three biblical water colors now available in the Archive will be supplemented in the future with early works, such as <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>, datable to c. 1780, and will continue through Blake’s final biblical water colors, such as <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi>. 
                    <lb/><lb/>

His legs are bent underneath him. Death rides on a white horse, which faces right and slightly up. The horse's back legs are extended backward, while its front legs are bent and drawn up. Its head is bent slightly back and its mouth is open. The horse may be jumping or flying. In the background behind Death are dark clouds. Below Death is a male figure with long hair, wearing armor that resembles scales along his legs, arms, and abdomen. He faces right and slightly away. His right arm is raised horizontally and he points with his right hand. His legs are bent underneath him as he rides a dark horse. His mouth is open. The figure below Death rides a dark horse that faces right and up. Its head is bent back with its mouth open and it may breath fire. Its front legs are extended forward. It may be jumping or flying. Flames back the figure below Death and may protrude from the dark horse's mouth. Above Death kneels or hovers a male figure with long, slightly curly hair and a gown. This figure faces forward and left, bending forward. His right leg is bent while his left leg is extended behind him. His arms are raised horizontally and between his hands he holds what appears to be a partly unrolled scroll. Behind this figure at the top of the design is what appears to be the sun, surrounded by feathers.
