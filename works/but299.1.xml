Naomi's hands are prominent, with palms out and finger's spread.  A slight (but originally more prominent?) halo surrounds her head.  Ruth, hunching over and looking down, embraces Naomi.  Subdued radiance surrounds her head.  On the right, Orpah walks away from the two women, bent over with her right hand on or behind her forehead while looking down.

Her posture suggests a cruciform configuration.  With open palms and spread fingers, she receives Ruth's embrace.  Naomi faces forward, and her left leg steps before her right leg, making her left foot prominent.  A few lines below her foot suggest that she may be wearing a sandal.  A veil or scarf covers her hair and falls over her right shoulder; a faint (but originally more prominent?) halo surrounds her head.  She faces the viewer though she looks somewhat to her left with her eyes lowered.  Dark lines, perhaps wrinkles and veins, appear on her face.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="AC"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>young</characteristic><characteristic>Ruth</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>belt</characteristic><characteristic>hem</characteristic><characteristic>left foot</characteristic><characteristic>knee</characteristic><characteristic>hunched over</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>facing down</characteristic><characteristic>fingers</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>embracing</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>bending forward</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent at knee</characteristic><characteristic>halo</characteristic><characteristic>radiance</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Ruth embraces Naomi on the left.  Ruth's right arm is wrapped behind Naomi, making only her right fingers discernible on Naomi’s right hip.  Ruth bends forward, toward Naomi, and looks down.  Ruth's left arm is extended at 45 degrees to embrace Naomi's right thigh.  Ruth is gowned, with a belt at her waist and with her left foot prominent at the hem.  She has long hair that cascades over her back.  Her left leg is bent at her prominent knee.  Golden radiance close to her head suggests a halo.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="BD"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>young</characteristic><characteristic>Orpah</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>belt</characteristic><characteristic>hem</characteristic><characteristic>striding</characteristic><characteristic>walking</characteristic><characteristic>legs spread</characteristic><characteristic>leg extended backward</characteristic><characteristic>feet</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>hunched over</characteristic><characteristic>bending forward</characteristic><characteristic>hand on face</characteristic><characteristic>short hair</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>fleeing</characteristic><characteristic>tiptoe</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>facing down</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent at knee</characteristic><characteristic>mouth open</characteristic><characteristic>eyes down</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Hunched over and facing right and down, Orpah turns away from Naomi and Ruth.
