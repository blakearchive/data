                electronic editions of our first installment of Blake’s letters, the correspondence
                of his last two years, 1825-27, mostly with his friend, benefactor, and fellow
                artist John Linnell, who sponsored such projects as Blake’s engraved <hi rend="i">Illustrations of the Book of Job</hi> (1826) and <hi rend="i">Illustrations to
                    Dante</hi>, on which he was still working when he died. <lb/><lb/> About ninety of Blake’s letters survive—an unknown fraction of the total. The
                surviving correspondence begins rather late in his career, in October 1791, the
                month before he turned 34, and ends, as far as we know, the month before his death
                at age 69 in August 1827—just three sentences to Linnell, to thank him for sending
                ten pounds and to indicate that his “journey to Hampstead on Sunday brought on a
                relapse . . . . however I am upon the mending hand to day &amp; hope soon to look as
                I did for I have been yellow accompanied by all the old Symptoms.” <lb/><lb/> Blake traveled seldom and not very far, and he was little known beyond a small
                circle of British contemporaries, most of them in London. His circle of
                correspondents was narrow and the geographical circuit small. But his modest body of
                correspondence comprises an absorbing, revealing miscellany of reports on work in
                progress alongside friendly and not so friendly exchanges on matters of practical
                and intellectual substance. Occasionally they burst out into visions that
                amalgamate, in a characteristic Blakean vein, homely details, intensely energized
                prose, and inspired poetry. <lb/><lb/> The letters are, in any case, indispensable in preserving facts and contexts
                for his life and work that would be otherwise unknown and in showing him shift
                pragmatically from role to role in a very natural—and human—way, exposing facets of
                character and personality not always so apparent in his art. The letters feel closer
                to the externalities of everyday life than any other work from Blake’s hand, and
                some start out to be one very ordinary thing and end up being another quite
                extraordinary thing. If Blake is not an artist-thinker in correspondence with an
                international circle, he seldom puts pen to paper without interesting consequences
                for readers.<lb/><lb/> In his letter of 12 April 1827 to Linnell, Blake refers to a small card he
                plans to engrave for his friend of many years, George Cumberland. An impression of
                the card is attached to the final page of the letter. We are also publishing another
                impression of Cumberland’s card (see Separate Plates and Prints in Series, Designed
                and Engraved by Blake).<lb/><lb/> The Archive now contains fully searchable and scalable electronic editions of
                important manuscripts and series of engravings, color printed drawings, tempera
                paintings, water color drawings, and 85 copies of Blake's nineteen illuminated
                books--all in the context of full bibliographic information about each work, careful
                diplomatic transcriptions of all texts, detailed descriptions of all images, and
                extensive bibliographies. <lb/><lb/> Due to recent security concerns related to Java browser plugins, the Archive
                has disabled its Java-based ImageSizer and Virtual Lightbox applications. Users can
                still view 100 and 300 dpi JPEG images as well as complete transcriptions for all
                works in the Archive. Text searching is also still available for all works in the
                Archive, and image searching remains available for all works except those in preview
                mode. In the coming months the Archive will implement redesigned pages that restore
                the features of ImageSizer and the Virtual Lightbox without the need for Java.<lb/><lb/> As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access
                restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible by the
                University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with the University of Rochester, the
                continuing support of the Library of Congress, and the cooperation of the
                international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us

                        "M[onday]" (see note to Object 2, line 14); Blake refers to the “D of C”
                        (probably Gerrard Andrewes, Dean of Canterbury, who died 2 June 1825) and to
                        either the death or ill health of “L.<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> L.-”
                        (probably Lord Lilford, who died 4 July 1825). Blake also thanks Linnell for
                        “Two Pounds”, apparently recently received. Since Linnell’s account book
                        records his paying £2 to Blake on 6 June 1825 (Bentley, <hi rend="i">Blake
                            Records</hi> page 588), the most probable date for the letter is the
                        first Tuesday after the dean’s death, 7 June 1825. See also Essick, *The Works of William Blake in the Huntington Collections*
