natural world, which occupies the top one-third.  Near the bottom of the plate, beneath the word
"hell" (line 6), a nude couple, perhaps (though not distinctly) female (left) and male (right) 
respectively, kiss while embracing.  They are probably intended to
represent the "marriage" of "heaven" and "hell" (lines 2, 4, 6).  The figure on the right, facing left with
its body twisted forward, is stretched out horizontally on a cloud; the figure on the left, facing right 
but with the body seen from the behind, hovers above a burst
of flames.  Above them several other figures, including some couples, fly upward between the
flames on the left and the clouds on the right.  Above them in turn, at ground level, in a
landscape of leafless arching trees whose roots are visible below ground, as if seen in cross-section, a
couple strolls on the left and a single figure kneels beside what may be another figure lying on the
ground.

A heraldic vignette announces
"The voice of the Devil" (lines 1-2): three angels blow their trumpets on either side of these two lines.  To the 
                  left of the text, two of the angels—one gowned, the other nude—face up and left;
to the right of the text, the third angel, also gowned, mirrors its companions, facing up and
right.  Beside the angel on the right, a vine, perhaps with one or two leaves and with at least one
loop, rises from the first letter of "been" in line three.  A bird flies to the right of the vine.  Three
leaf-like flags extend from the "d" of "sacred" and the "h" of "have" in line 3.  These flags may
represent the musical notes of the trumpeters.  Below the bird, at the end
of line 4, two figures, a gowned female and a child, reach out to each other, nearly touching
hands. Further down, to the right of line 6, a small figure, its body and arms horizontal, flees from a
recumbent figure on a leaf.  Next to the words "the Soul" in line 9 are eight figures in sundry
                  positions: the first of these—its body horizontal—flies toward two huddled figures.  The figure
facing right crouches or squats, reaching an arm out to its companion.  The other figure sits
facing left with hunched shoulders.  They are followed by two hand-holding figures who hover above
a streamer extending from the "M" of "Man" in line 10.  Next to this pair, three figures huddle
together on some vegetation consisting of leaves and/or vines.  Following the word
"Energies" in line 11 are four figures and two animals: the first animal, perhaps a horse, kicks
up its back heels.  Next to it stand two children holding hands, followed by another hand-holding
pair, a child and an adult.  The latter extends his left arm horizontally, perhaps pointing to the ox
which grazes nearby on a bit of tableland.  An ornamental ribbon, most likely vegetative in nature,
closes the vignette.  Further down the plate, a leaf grows from the "B" of "But" in line 12; this motif
continues in the following line, where a leaf ornament introduces the text, and a leaf-like serif
extends from the "l" of "Soul," closing line 13.  A branch with spiky leaves grows from the "e"
of "age" in line 16.  Following it, an amorphous, horizontal figure hovers above two wispy lines,
suggesting cirrus-like clouds or vines.  The figure raises its arm, seemingly in an effort to make
contact with the adjacent figure, who prepares to leave its vegetative bed.  To the right, a man walks a
small dog on a leash.  An indistinct shape, perhaps a child, is stationed nearby.  Headed in its
direction, a lumbering figure, bearded or blindfolded, walks (runs?) in a contorted position,
viz., bending forward from the waist with one arm outstretched in front of him.  Mimicking his
general posture, a shadow or an anthropomorphic tree arches to the left.  Near the margin between
lines 17 and 18, a small figure is supported by a cane.  Six figures observe a seventh figure one line
down.  With legs slightly apart and arms raised, it appears to address its audience from behind a stump,
staff, or walking stick.  To its back is either a disproportionally large branch with a leaf, or else
the fallen branch of a tree.  Concluding the procession, two horses, the second of which is
indicated merely by some faint profile lines, pull a figure in a cart.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="AB"><characteristic>angel</characteristic><characteristic>trumpeter</characteristic><characteristic>herald</characteristic><characteristic>playing</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>facing up</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>rising</characteristic><characteristic>hovering</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Three angels blow their trumpets on either side of the plate's first two lines:

tendril of a grapevine with a single leaf attached at the end extends to the right margin.  The grapevine motif 
is reproduced elsewhere, and various leaves, buds, serpentine vines and/or flowers adorn the plate passim. 
Dangling from the end of line 4 is a cluster of grapes.  Further down, in the right margin, a flock of birds soars on
extended wings.  A detached vine or branch, possibly with leaves, appears in the general space
occupied by the birds, coinciding with one of their wings.  Line 15 is teeming with small-scale designs: An
eagle, lion, two figures, and some grazing sheep appear in close proximity to one another. 
Below, next to "rod" in line 18, a small figure, perhaps a child, peers up at a vaguely anthropomorphic
tree.  Following "fruits" in line 22 is a fruit- or blossom-bearing branch.  To the right, numerous
birds fly above a picturesque seascape, complete with boats or ships, and a tree grows
from the side of a cliff overlooking the water.  Two lines down, a coiled snake faces a leaping

leaves) to the immediate right of "Hell" (line 1) reappears elsewhere on the plate: below "Truth" in 
line 15, and again above line 17, where it is attached to a looped vine.  Other vegetative motifs
adorn the plate passim: a long, slender branch with leaves or buds follows "contemptible" in line 5,
and some flame-like leaves appear in the right margin above "and" in line 15.  To the left of
"Enough! or Too much" in line 17 is a small sprig of ivy.  Numerous figures populate the plate, all of
which are concentrated in the spaces following the text of lines 7 and 13.  Four figures follow line 7.  
Of these, two face each other as they hover in the air.  A third figure, adjacent
to the other pair, lies supine(?) on a gentle slope, which resembles a cloud.  To the right, the last
figure of this group raises its arms horizontally and extends one leg backward.  The second group
of figures appears after line 13.  The figure on the far left (right of a vine or leaf) holds a rope or
scarf.

stylized vegetative designs appear passim: a leaf- or vine-like swirl curves around "As" in line 4. 
A long, slender branch with buds or leaves, recalling a similar motif on Plate 8, stretches to the
right margin following the word "contemptible" in line 5.  Two lines down, in the left margin, a

five gowned human figures sitting in severely contracted positions, all crowded into a dark stone
chamber, prison, or cavern.  The heads of all except the bearded central figure, who looks out
toward the viewer, are down and turned toward the center.  Though the limbs of the figures are

Swedenborg's self-deceptions: he imagines "himself the single / one on earth that ever broke a
net" (Plate 21, lines 13-14; Plate 22, line 1).  Beyond this shape, a hunched figure (possibly 
holding a book or tablet) sits on the crest of a wave(?) or a vine.  Following "falshoods" in line 
4, a figure clad in a billowing garment hovers amidst some vegetation.  One arm seems to point
downward and to the left.  Below, two elaborate spirals radiate from a common center right of line
8.  To the right of "further" in line 11 are several large leaves.  Next to "number" in line 16, 
three birds soar on extended wings.  To the left of the long-tailed bird and below the small, 
nondescript bird are two swollen vegetable forms.  A loop extending from the "h" of "he" at the
end of line 17 coincides with the wing of the largest bird.  Four figures bound the plate's 
inscription, "A Memorable Fancy," on three sides in line 20.  The first figure reclines beneath 
some leaves and branches to the left of the text.  The vegetation transforms into loops and 
squiggles clinging to the margin of the plate.  Above the inscription, a hovering figure, arm(s)
extended, seems to reach for a serpent.  The four-looped vine growing from the "F" of "Fancy"  
(line 20) and the squiggly "y" of the same word continue the serpentine motif.  To the right of
the text, the third figure of the vignette stands facing up and to the right with arms raised at
135 degrees.  His or her head is bent back, and the figure's posture suggests that he or she has 
just been impaled by the invisible arrow released from the bow of the fourth figure, who leaps 
through the air brandishing the weapon.  Behind him, a vine or snake coils around a tall tuft of 
grass.  Further down, a flower with leaves and/or thorns adorns the space following "words" in 
line 23.  On the other side of the flower, a flying bird or insect appears to carry a snake 
through the air, recalling similar motifs on Plates 5, 15, and 19.  Vegetable forms follow, the
second of which resembles a flaccid, vegetating worm or snake.  A vine-like form, perhaps 
suggesting a serpent of odd shape, hovers below line 25 on the left. Ornamenting the left margin 
are various other small-scale vegetative designs attached to letters.</illusobjdesc><component type="animal" location="B"><characteristic>fish</characteristic><characteristic>serpentine</characteristic><characteristic>net</characteristic><characteristic>vine</characteristic><characteristic>loop</characteristic><illusobjdesc>At the end of line 1, a scrolled, serpentine shape with wavy lines

its head resting on its knees at one end of a serpentine vegetative motif.  Completing the vignette is
another figure striding along the wavy ascender of "the" in line 2.  Its position and gestures are
ambiguous: the figure possibly faces right, a scarf floating behind it.  Alternatively, one might view
the figure as facing left, grasping a disproportionally large scrolled shape; the design would then
perhaps illustrate the angel of lines 2 and 3 "embracing the flame of fire."  Next to "Elijah" at the
end of line 4, a gowned figure hovers, facing left.  A winged figure hovers
below the first two words of line 4.  This nude figure, seen from behind, is colored in red in this
                  copy.  A serried scene of five sundry figures—flanked
                  by books on the right and more books, or possibly vegetation, on the left—appears between the text
of lines 4 and 5.  Each of the figures sits or kneels.  To the left of the first figure is an uncertain
shape, possibly another figure.  A small horse leaps right above "world" in line 8.  Following "well" at
the end of the same line, a figure runs rightward, reaching for a small child.  The top half of the
plate is dense with interlinear loops, vines, banners, and leaves, e.g., the vines and/or roots on
either side of the figures populating the space between lines 4 and 5; the looped vines growing from
the descender of "my" and the ascender of "friend," both in line 6; the elaborate curlicues following
the text of line 10; and the small branch with spiky leaves extending from the "l" of "also" in

connects with the "h" of "shot" at the end of line 9.  Further down, a snake (or simply a line?) stretches from 
"away" in line 12 to the right margin.  A relatively large-scale interlinear branch and leaf combination ornaments 
the space beside "rocks" in line 18.  Right of line 21 is a seated figure.  Its right arm is extended horizontally 
towards two lightly printed vegetative forms.  In other copies these forms appear to be a hovering figure reaching towards 
the seated figure.  A group of five figures, possibly signifying the "gloomy king" and his retinue of lines 15-17, 
appears after "king" in line 23: the first figure stands facing right; the second sits cross-legged(?) on the ground.
They are followed by another pair who stand with arms extended, hailing the fifth figure, perhaps the king.  He walks
toward them with arms outstretched.  Above "his" at the end of line 24 is a large leaf.  Various other vegetative motifs 
adorn the plate, e.g., the looped vines growing from the ascenders of "London" and "thunder" in lines 4 and 24; the leaf
extending from the "h" of "then" in line 21; and the banner waving from the "b" of "born" in line 1.  </illusobjdesc><component type="animal" location="A"><characteristic>stag</characteristic><characteristic>horn</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>leaping</characteristic><characteristic>lunging</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Following "night" in line 2, a stag—its horns discernible—leaps right, a mirror

for the "starry" and "gloomy" king of this "Song of Liberty."  He kneels on one leg and points(?) toward another 
figure with his left arm, raised horizontally.  Running amidst wispy clouds, this second figure may represent the 
"son of fire in his eastern / cloud," who is named in lines 4 and 5 and in whose direction the king of the text 
casts his eyes.  Three lines down, two horses, one of which is mounted, gallop leftward in the direction of another

line 13.  The horse on the left gallops or leaps toward the text.  Its companion rears up on hind legs, arching its 
head up and back.  A small bird soars to the right of and above "Chorus" (line 13), which is circumscribed by 
                  vegetative flourishes, including wavy, serpentine lines.  Above line 21, a flock of six birds—the largest an eagle
