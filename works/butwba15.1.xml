  <updatestmt> 
The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of a digital edition of forty-seven monochrome wash drawings created by Blake between c. 1774 and c. 1786.  
<lb/>
<lb/>
The use of monochrome washes to tint a pencil or pen and ink drawing offered eighteenth-century artists several advantages. They could register gradations in tone, from the white of the untouched paper to jet black, without the more time-consuming use of actual colors. No further work was required if the wash drawing was intended as a preliminary for an uncolored engraving. A monochrome wash could also be used to underlie subsequent applications of water colors, thereby darkening selected areas to create the illusion of depth or cast motifs in shadow.  
<lb/>
<lb/>
As the works presented here show, Blake made full use of monochrome washes from his earliest years as an artist. When assigned by his engraving master, James Basire, to record tombs in Westminster Abbey c. 1774-75, Blake applied black and gray washes to tint many of his drawings (Objects 1-5). These carefully executed works could then be used as preliminaries for subsequent engravings by Basire’s workshop.
<lb/>
<lb/>
Blake’s monochrome washes during his first decade as an independent artist and engraver include several interrelated groups. The seven drawings of figures from Michelangelo’s Sistine ceiling (Objects 37-43) demonstrate how copying engravings of works by Renaissance masters helped Blake learn postures and gestures he would later use in his own compositions. Other drawings provide visual evidence of how Blake developed a design from early sketches to highly finished water colors or engravings. The recto/verso drawings, <hi rend="i">Two Sketches for “Joseph Making Himself Known to His Brethren”</hi> (Objects 34 and 35), are preliminaries for the finished water color in the Fitzwilliam Museum, one of three illustrations of the biblical story of Joseph that are among Blake’s finest pictorial works of the 1780s. The three Joseph water colors are in the Archive along with a water color preliminary for <hi rend="i">Joseph Ordering Simeon to be Bound</hi>. The evolution of one of Blake’s earliest original book illustrations, a frontispiece for Thomas Commins’ <hi rend="i">Elegy Set to Music</hi> of 1786, can be traced through three variant wash drawings (Objects 45-47) and a pencil sketch also in the Archive. The four wash versions of <hi rend="i">The Good Farmer</hi> reproduced here (Objects 16-19), in addition to two pen and ink drawings of the subject previously added to the Archive, show the complex ways Blake played variations on a theme as he worked toward a final version. No such finished work is known, and thus these drawings are our only record of Blake’s engagement with this subject. Similarly, for <hi rend="i">War Unchained by an Angel, Fire, Pestilence, and Famine Following</hi>, an untraced work Blake exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1784, we have only a preliminary study (Object 6).
<lb/>
<lb/>
Blake’s illustrations to his poem <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> of c. 1789 are among his most accomplished monochrome wash drawings. These have been published in the Archive as an independent group coordinated with the <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> manuscript.

                    <p>The attribution of this drawing to Blake is far from certain.  Blake's engraving master, James Basire, was commissioned to provide illustrations for Richard Gough, *Sepulchral Monuments, in Great Britain*, 1786. Blake was assigned the task of drawing pictures of the tomb monuments in Westminster Abbey. In addition to this drawing of the tomb effigy of Edward the Third, Blake executed three other drawings of his tomb, Butlin 41-43.  Unlike those three, this drawing was not engraved and published in Gough's book. The inscription in the lower margin ("KING EDWARD III. | From his Tomb in Westminster Abbey") may not be by Blake even if one accepts the attribution of the drawing to him.  The collection stamp of Westminster Libraries appears top left.  This drawing was unknown until its discovery in 1987; see Martin Butlin, "A New Blake from his Apprentice Years?," *Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly*, 21.4 (spring 1988): 143.</p></objnote>

                    <illusobjdesc>This wash drawing depicts the upper torso and head of a statue, identified as the effigy of King Edward III from his tomb in Westminster Abbey. He has long, wavy hair and a long beard that reaches his chest. His face is depicted prominently in the center of the drawing facing outward, directly toward the viewer. Although his eyes are open, the eye sockets are empty, suggesting that the drawing is of a lifeless statue rather than a living man. His forehead and brow are creased and his lips are pursed. A cloak or cape with a brocade or patterned edge is wrapped around his rounded shoulders. He wears a tunic or shirt decorated with a wide band across his chest.
