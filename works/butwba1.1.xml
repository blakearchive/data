                <objnote><p>This is an alternative preliminary design for the etching/engraving, designed and engraved by Blake, for Thomas Commins, *An Elegy Set to Music* (1786).  The verso of this monochrome wash drawing includes several pencil sketches, some related to Blake's engraving for Commins.  The discovery (or rediscovery) of this wash drawing was announced in Martin Butlin, "Two Newly Identified Sketches for Thomas Commins's *An Elegy*: A Postscript," *Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly*, 27.2 (fall 1993): 42-44.  Curiously, the illustration of this drawing in Butlin's essay shows a complete circle at the top of the design.  The illustration in the 1995 Christie's catalogue (see Provenance, above) shows the drawing in its present condition with the circle cut off by the edge of the leaf.  The pencil inscription lower right on the leaf, "not(?) this Shape," is a later addition not by Blake.</p></objnote>

                    <illusobjdesc>This wash drawing depicts three figures within a circular frame. On the left, a bearded man steps out of a boat. He bends his right leg to step out of the boat, with the lower half of the leg positioned on the edge of the boat. His left leg is outside of the boat, with his left foot stepping in the water near a shore or bank. His body faces right, hunched slightly forward, and he reaches toward the figure opposite him with arms extended horizontally. The right arm is bent slightly at the elbow and his fingers graze the fingers of the figure to his right. His left arm reaches toward the figure’s chest with outstretched fingers. His head is twisted over his shoulder and raised up to look behind him, to the left. He wears a skirt or gown that ends just above his knees. Two male(?) angels with large wings hover to the right. Closest to the viewer, an angel with long curly hair faces left with both arms raised at forty-five degrees. His face appears in profile and he looks toward the man leaving the boat. Both palms are held up and the index finger of the left hand touches the index finger of the facing man. The angel’s legs are extended backward with his right leg bent slightly at the knee and his bare foot visible under the gown. A second angel hovers behind the angel closest to the viewer. Only one arm and one wing of the second angel are visible. He has long curly hair and looks downward to the man leaving the boat. The figures appear on the bank of a river or other body of water. A small, wooden boat appears to be anchored in the water. Large clouds fill the sky behind the figures. Dark wash in the background may represent distant hills or mountains. </illusobjdesc>
