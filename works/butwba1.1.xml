The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of a digital edition of forty-seven monochrome wash drawings created by Blake between c. 1774 and c. 1786.  
<lb/>
<lb/>
The use of monochrome washes to tint a pencil or pen and ink drawing offered eighteenth-century artists several advantages. They could register gradations in tone, from the white of the untouched paper to jet black, without the more time-consuming use of actual colors. No further work was required if the wash drawing was intended as a preliminary for an uncolored engraving. A monochrome wash could also be used to underlie subsequent applications of water colors, thereby darkening selected areas to create the illusion of depth or cast motifs in shadow.  
<lb/>
<lb/>
As the works presented here show, Blake made full use of monochrome washes from his earliest years as an artist. When assigned by his engraving master, James Basire, to record tombs in Westminster Abbey c. 1774-75, Blake applied black and gray washes to tint many of his drawings (Objects 1-5). These carefully executed works could then be used as preliminaries for subsequent engravings by Basire’s workshop.
<lb/>
<lb/>
Blake’s monochrome washes during his first decade as an independent artist and engraver include several interrelated groups. The seven drawings of figures from Michelangelo’s Sistine ceiling (Objects 37-43) demonstrate how copying engravings of works by Renaissance masters helped Blake learn postures and gestures he would later use in his own compositions. Other drawings provide visual evidence of how Blake developed a design from early sketches to highly finished water colors or engravings. The recto/verso drawings, <hi rend="i">Two Sketches for “Joseph Making Himself Known to His Brethren”</hi> (Objects 34 and 35), are preliminaries for the finished water color in the Fitzwilliam Museum, one of three illustrations of the biblical story of Joseph that are among Blake’s finest pictorial works of the 1780s. The three Joseph water colors are in the Archive along with a water color preliminary for <hi rend="i">Joseph Ordering Simeon to be Bound</hi>. The evolution of one of Blake’s earliest original book illustrations, a frontispiece for Thomas Commins’ <hi rend="i">Elegy Set to Music</hi> of 1786, can be traced through three variant wash drawings (Objects 45-47) and a pencil sketch also in the Archive. The four wash versions of <hi rend="i">The Good Farmer</hi> reproduced here (Objects 16-19), in addition to two pen and ink drawings of the subject previously added to the Archive, show the complex ways Blake played variations on a theme as he worked toward a final version. No such finished work is known, and thus these drawings are our only record of Blake’s engagement with this subject. Similarly, for <hi rend="i">War Unchained by an Angel, Fire, Pestilence, and Famine Following</hi>, an untraced work Blake exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1784, we have only a preliminary study (Object 6).
<lb/>
<lb/>
Blake’s illustrations to his poem <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> of c. 1789 are among his most accomplished monochrome wash drawings. These have been published in the Archive as an independent group coordinated with the <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> manuscript.

                <objnote><p>This is an alternative preliminary design for the etching/engraving, designed and engraved by Blake, for Thomas Commins, *An Elegy Set to Music* (1786).  The verso of this monochrome wash drawing includes several pencil sketches, some related to Blake's engraving for Commins.  The discovery (or rediscovery) of this wash drawing was announced in Martin Butlin, "Two Newly Identified Sketches for Thomas Commins's *An Elegy*: A Postscript," *Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly*, 27.2 (fall 1993): 42-44.  Curiously, the illustration of this drawing in Butlin's essay shows a complete circle at the top of the design.  The illustration in the 1995 Christie's catalogue (see Provenance, above) shows the drawing in its present condition with the circle cut off by the edge of the leaf.  The pencil inscription lower right on the leaf, "not(?) this Shape," is a later addition not by Blake.</p></objnote>

                    <illusobjdesc>This wash drawing depicts three figures within a circular frame. On the left, a bearded man steps out of a boat. He bends his right leg to step out of the boat, with the lower half of the leg positioned on the edge of the boat. His left leg is outside of the boat, with his left foot stepping in the water near a shore or bank. His body faces right, hunched slightly forward, and he reaches toward the figure opposite him with arms extended horizontally. The right arm is bent slightly at the elbow and his fingers graze the fingers of the figure to his right. His left arm reaches toward the figure’s chest with outstretched fingers. His head is twisted over his shoulder and raised up to look behind him, to the left. He wears a skirt or gown that ends just above his knees. Two male(?) angels with large wings hover to the right. Closest to the viewer, an angel with long curly hair faces left with both arms raised at forty-five degrees. His face appears in profile and he looks toward the man leaving the boat. Both palms are held up and the index finger of the left hand touches the index finger of the facing man. The angel’s legs are extended backward with his right leg bent slightly at the knee and his bare foot visible under the gown. A second angel hovers behind the angel closest to the viewer. Only one arm and one wing of the second angel are visible. He has long curly hair and looks downward to the man leaving the boat. The figures appear on the bank of a river or other body of water. A small, wooden boat appears to be anchored in the water. Large clouds fill the sky behind the figures. Dark wash in the background may represent distant hills or mountains. </illusobjdesc>
