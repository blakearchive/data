    The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of thirty-three of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible.  All take their subjects from the New Testament and have been added to the twenty Old Testament subjects published in March 2010 as “Illustrations to the Bible, c. 1780-1824,” under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.  This new group is presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).
                <lb/><lb/>
                   Blake executed most of these New Testament water colors c. 1800-05 for his patron Thomas Butts.  The exceptions are <hi rend="i">The Whore of Babylon</hi> of 1809 and <hi rend="i">The Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins</hi> in the Yale Center for British Art, datable to c. 1825. The subjects range from the childhood of Jesus to his ascension, the later history of his parents and one of his major followers, St. Paul, and a group of eight designs based on the Book of Revelation.  While the illustrations of the life of Christ are fairly conventional in their subjects, in part because of the long tradition of picturing almost every event in the Gospels, individual motifs recall designs in Blake’s illuminated books and thus offer a window on Blake’s visual interpretation of the Bible. The illustrations of Revelation complement Blake’s intense engagement with apocalyptic events and images in his own poetry.
                    <lb/><lb/>
                        The selection of fifty-three biblical water colors now available in the Archive will be supplemented in the future with early works, such as <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>, datable to c. 1780, and will continue through Blake’s final biblical water colors, such as <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi>. 
                    <lb/><lb/>

In the center of the design sits an old man with long hair and a beard, facing forward; this is presumably God. He wears a gown and has a halo-like aura. He faces forward and rests His arms, which are raised at 45 degrees and bent upward, on His throne, from which two bolts of lightning emanate downward. God is holding a scroll sealed with seven spots of sealing wax in His right hand.
  On the left of the design stand at least four old men wearing gowns and facing to the right. Each man bends forward and has his right arm raised at 45 degrees and bent slightly. In their right hands, they hold crowns that they are placing before God. To the right of the design stand at least four old male figures wearing gowns, facing left and down. The three frontmost figures reach downward with their left arms and hold crowns in their left hands. This scene presumably takes place in heaven, though the sky is dark except for the beams of light emanating from God. The ground appears to be made out of waves or clouds. At the top of the design, directly above God is part of an arching rainbow. At the bottom center of the design are seven cherubs with short, curly hair and wings. They all appear to be male and facing forward. Each cherub has a flame over his head. A plinth or altar is visible behind the middle three cherubs. On the altar is a supine lamb; above the lamb are at least six spikes that may be flames or part of a crown. An arch comprising various animal and humanoid figures, with at least nine eyes on the left and eight eyes on the right, frames the scene. All eyes appear to be looking at God. The figures that make up the left side of the arch look right and the figures that make up the right side of the arch look left. On the right side of the arch, near God's left hand, the heads of a lion and a male human are visible. The lion has its mouth open and at least one tooth is visible. The male figure has curly hair and a beard and may be gowned. On the left side of the arch, near the top of the scroll that God holds, can be seen a male human head and the head of a large bird. The bird is feathered and has its beak open; this is the eagle of Revelation 4:7. The male may be nude and may have curly hair. In the area between the arch, the rainbow and God, there are at least thirty eyes and four heads visible. The eyes look forward and left. The two leftmost figures in this area both appear to have long hair and face forward and down. The two rightmost figures in this area face forward and down and look left. The upper figure appears to be the head of a cow or ox with horns. The bottom figure may have long hair and a beard and bend its right arm upward, perhaps crossing its arms.
