Jesus and his twelve apostles sit in a darkened, shadowy room on carpets that are rolled to provide cushions. In the center of the group are (left to right) a goblet, a pitcher with a loaf of bread below it, another goblet, a plate with three loaves of bread and an empty plate above it, and a third goblet. Jesus sits at the head of the group, facing forward and leaning on a roll of carpet with his left arm. He wears a gown, and has long hair, a beard, and a halo composed of beams of light. His legs are stretched out to the left. His arms are bent upward, with his palms out and his fingers outspread. To the left of Jesus sit four apostles. The leftmost apostle sits, facing away but with his head turned to the right, perhaps to look at Jesus. He wears a gown like a toga, and has curly hair and a beard. His legs are bent under him so that he sits on them. His arms are bent upward, with his palms out and his fingers spread, as if in imitation of Jesus's gesture. The second apostle from the left in this group sits facing forward, but looking up and to his right. He appears to be an old man with long hair and a beard. He also wears a gown and has his arms raised, with his hands together as if in prayer. The apostle second from the right has long hair and sits, facing forward but looking to the right and down, with his left arm leaning on a carpet roll. His arms are raised, with his hands clasped together, as if in prayer. He wears a gown. The rightmost apostle in this group sits, facing forward, but looking to the right. He wears a gown and has curly hair and a beard. His arms are bent with his hands together, as if in prayer. To the right of Jesus sit four apostles. The leftmost apostle, though presumably a male, is very feminine looking. This may be John, the youngest of the Evangelists. He has long, curly hair, wears a gown, and sits facing forward and looking to the left, presumably at Jesus. Like Jesus, his legs are extended out, though this apostle's are to the right. His arms are crossed with his hands on his chest, finger's slightly spread. The next apostle to the right sits, facing left, and presumably looking at Jesus. His right arm is raised, with his hand at his face, palm vertical, perhaps in a gesture of surprise or an attempt to shield his face. He has curly hair and a beard. The next apostle to the right in this group sits, facing forward but looking to the left. He has curly hair and wears a gown. He leans with his right arm on a carpet roll with his right hand on his breast. His left arm is bent with the palm out and fingers spread. This gesture suggests that the man is indicating that he is not the one who will betray Christ. The rightmost apostle in this group sits, or perhaps kneels, facing left. He has a beard and his shoulders are hunched, as his head faces down. His arms are raised, with his hands together as if in prayer or supplication. In the foreground is a third group of four apostles. The leftmost apostle appears to be lying, facing away and to the right. He wears a gown and his body is slightly twisted. He has slightly curly hair and a beard, and his arms are bent with his hands together, as if in prayer or supplication. The next apostle to the right sits, facing away, with his legs extended to the left. He is partly clothed by a cloth or drapery around his waist. He faces right to look at the apostle to his right, and has his mouth open. He may be speaking. He also leans with his right arm on a carpet roll. The apostle second from the right in this group sits, facing away but looking to the apostle on the left. He has long curly hair and wears a gown like a toga. His left arm is raised, with the palm vertical and fingers spread. His legs are outstretched to the right. His mouth is slightly open; he may be speaking. The rightmost apostle of this group sits, facing forward, with his legs outstretched to the right. He leans with his right arm on a carpet roll. His left arm is bent, with the palm up and fingers spread to hold coins. He seems to point to his left palm with his right index finger to count the coins. There may be a purse dangling from his right wrist.  This is Judas, Christ's betrayer (although in the Bible he will not receive payment until after the betrayal). He has long hair and a beard and is probably looking at the coins.
