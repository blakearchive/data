                <objnote><p>This is one of seven monochrome wash drawings (Objects 37-43) by Blake of figures painted by Michelangelo in the Sistine Chapel.  They were very probably copied from the engravings of Adamo Ghisi, after drawings by Giorgio Ghisi, published in *Pitture dipinte nella Volta della Capella Sistina nel Vaticano* (1773).  The wash drawing, *Solomon*, is on the recto of this drawing.</p></objnote>

                    <illusobjdesc>A gowned woman sits on a large block and hunches forward to hold the infant boy seated in her lap. The two may be the child Abiud and his mother. The woman's body faces left as she sits on the block in a contracted position, but turns her head over her left shoulder to look at something in the distance with an expression of fear or concern. Her legs are bent and knees are spread to support the infant on her lap. A bare foot is visible under her gown. Her left arm bends at the elbow to wrap around the infant's back and her visible right hand rests on his shoulder. A long gown and a veil partially covers her hair and extends behind her back and over her lap. The infant sits on the woman's lap facing right. His legs are bent at the knee to draw up under his body and his bare right foot his visible under his gown. His right arm extends upward around the woman’s neck and his right fist is clenched. A portion of the woman’s veil is draped over his head but his short curly hair is visible beneath. His cheek touches the Virgin woman’s and he looks to the right, apparently in the same direction as the woman and with the same expression of fear or concern. The block on which the woman sits rests on a bare floor. The background is plain, perhaps representing a bare wall behind the figures. </illusobjdesc>
