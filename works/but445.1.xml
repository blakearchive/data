The incident is also described in Exodus 17:5-6. The largest figure in the design, standing in a half-crouching position to the left of center, is Moses. He has short, curly hair and a long beard. He is partly clothed in draping cloth that leaves his arms, lower legs, and chest bare. His body is twisted to face forward and left. Both legs are bent at the knee and his right foot may be on tiptoe. His left arm is at his side but bent, with the fingers of his left hand spread, perhaps to hold onto a rock. His right arm is raised at 135 degrees and he holds a rod in his right hand; his right hand also points to the right and up slightly. Moses seems to look at the group of Israelites in front of him, with his mouth open, perhaps indicating that he is speaking. Moses and his compatriots are in a rocky landscape, with a hill or cliff on the top right of the design. The lower foreground may also be rocky, or it may be sandy. A stream of water or waterfall pours from the top of the boulder or cliff in the right top corner of the design, down to the left bottom corner. The sky backing the scene is cloudy. In the bottom center of the design, four figures are kneeling. The leftmost figure is that of a gowned old man, bending forward. He has long hair and a beard. His left arm is at his side and bent upward, and in his left hand he holds what may be a hat or bowl. Both his feet are visible beneath the hem of his gown. He faces left and down, and appears to be drinking. The figure second from the left is also gowned with long hair, but beyond that its age and gender are indeterminable. It bends forward and faces down and to the left. It may be drinking as well. The figure second from the right in this group is a bare-chested female with long hair and a skirt or cloth wrapped around her waist. Her body is twisted so that her legs face left, her chest faces slightly forward, and she looks up and to the right. Her mouth is partly open, and she may be surprised or speaking. Her arms are raised horizontally, with her left palm up. The rightmost figure of the group is a partly clothed man, wearing breeches. This is probably Aaron, who "gathered the congregation together before the rock" (Numbers 20:10). He has short, curly hair and is seen from behind, though he turns his head to look to the right and up slightly. His feet are both on tiptoe. His left arm is raised horizontally, palm down, while his right arm is raised at 135 degrees, palm vertical. In the bottom right corner of the design stands a group of at least six figures. The leftmost figure is a gowned child, perhaps a girl, with long hair. She faces left and slightly forward and looks down at the water. Her mouth is partly open. Her expression, like that of the woman above her, suggests surprise. The figure second from the left is an old woman wearing a gown and a veil over her hair. She faces forward and left, and looks down at the water. Her mouth is partly open. The figure third from the left is an old man with long hair and a beard. He may be wearing a gown as well. He faces to the left and looks down. The figure third from the right is a young, male child with short, curly hair. He appears to be nude. He is being held off the ground by the woman to the right. He faces to the left and forward slightly, looking down with an open mouth at the water. His arms are raised horizontally and reaching, presumably for the water. His left leg is also visible. The figure second from the right is a gowned woman with long, slightly curly hair. Her face is obscured by the child she is holding. She faces to the left and down. The rightmost figure is visible only as a top of a head, with slightly curly hair. Nonetheless, the figure seems to face left.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>Moses</characteristic><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>partly nude</characteristic><characteristic>cloth</characteristic><characteristic>short hair</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent</characteristic><characteristic>crouching</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>rod</characteristic><characteristic>pointing</characteristic><characteristic>speaking</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>twisted</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>tiptoe</characteristic><characteristic>arm at side</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent</characteristic><characteristic>fingers spread</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised at 135 degrees</characteristic><characteristic>mouth open</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The largest figure in the design, standing in a half-crouching position to the left of center, is Moses.
