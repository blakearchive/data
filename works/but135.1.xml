            <updatestmt> 
The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of a digital edition of forty-seven monochrome wash drawings created by Blake between c. 1774 and c. 1786.  
<lb/>
<lb/>
The use of monochrome washes to tint a pencil or pen and ink drawing offered eighteenth-century artists several advantages. They could register gradations in tone, from the white of the untouched paper to jet black, without the more time-consuming use of actual colors. No further work was required if the wash drawing was intended as a preliminary for an uncolored engraving. A monochrome wash could also be used to underlie subsequent applications of water colors, thereby darkening selected areas to create the illusion of depth or cast motifs in shadow.  
<lb/>
<lb/>
As the works presented here show, Blake made full use of monochrome washes from his earliest years as an artist. When assigned by his engraving master, James Basire, to record tombs in Westminster Abbey c. 1774-75, Blake applied black and gray washes to tint many of his drawings (Objects 1-5). These carefully executed works could then be used as preliminaries for subsequent engravings by Basire’s workshop.
<lb/>
<lb/>
Blake’s monochrome washes during his first decade as an independent artist and engraver include several interrelated groups. The seven drawings of figures from Michelangelo’s Sistine ceiling (Objects 37-43) demonstrate how copying engravings of works by Renaissance masters helped Blake learn postures and gestures he would later use in his own compositions. Other drawings provide visual evidence of how Blake developed a design from early sketches to highly finished water colors or engravings. The recto/verso drawings, <hi rend="i">Two Sketches for “Joseph Making Himself Known to His Brethren”</hi> (Objects 34 and 35), are preliminaries for the finished water color in the Fitzwilliam Museum, one of three illustrations of the biblical story of Joseph that are among Blake’s finest pictorial works of the 1780s. The three Joseph water colors are in the Archive along with a water color preliminary for <hi rend="i">Joseph Ordering Simeon to be Bound</hi>. The evolution of one of Blake’s earliest original book illustrations, a frontispiece for Thomas Commins’ <hi rend="i">Elegy Set to Music</hi> of 1786, can be traced through three variant wash drawings (Objects 45-47) and a pencil sketch also in the Archive. The four wash versions of <hi rend="i">The Good Farmer</hi> reproduced here (Objects 16-19), in addition to two pen and ink drawings of the subject previously added to the Archive, show the complex ways Blake played variations on a theme as he worked toward a final version. No such finished work is known, and thus these drawings are our only record of Blake’s engagement with this subject. Similarly, for <hi rend="i">War Unchained by an Angel, Fire, Pestilence, and Famine Following</hi>, an untraced work Blake exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1784, we have only a preliminary study (Object 6).
<lb/>
<lb/>
Blake’s illustrations to his poem <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> of c. 1789 are among his most accomplished monochrome wash drawings. These have been published in the Archive as an independent group coordinated with the <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> manuscript.

                    <illusobjdesc>This design shows the death scene of an old man, who is surrounded by his family, and whose spirit hovers over the scene and frightens the gathered mourners. The spirit hovers in the left third of the design, his bare feet pointed and lifted off the ground in the lower left-hand corner, and his body held diagonally toward the bed in the design's center. The spirit wears a long-sleeved gown that reaches his ankles and is gathered at the waist by a belt. A long, looping cloth is suspended in a circle around the spirit's body. It extends over his right arm, which is held away from his body and bent upward. He points upward with the index finger of his right hand. The looping cloth terminates near the spirit's left hand, which rises near his waist as his arm bends in a near 90-degree angle. The left hand is nearly flat, with the fingers pointing down and to the left. The spirit has long hair and a long beard. As he leans rightward to hover over the bed, his head appears in profile, and his eyes stare toward the mourners at right. In the center of the design is a simple wooden bed with a dark blanket that covers the body of the deceased man. Only his head appears; his eyes are closed, and he has the same long hair and long beard as the spirit. Behind the bed are three figures who appear to be kneeling and who react with fear to the man's spirit. They are, from left to right, as follows: a young woman with long hair who stares open-mouthed at the spirit; a young man with short, curly hair who faces left and huddles together with the young woman; and an older woman in a long-sleeved gown and headscarf who extends her arm over the bed, toward the spirit, and raises her palm as if attempting to ward him off. In front of the bed is a partly nude man who kneels on his right knee and extends his left leg forward as he leans away from the spirit. The man's left leg nearly straightens, and it extends almost to the foot of the bed. His right knee bends sharply as he leans backward, and his right foot is flexed to support him. His left arm extends downward and to the left, along his left leg, and the fingers of his left hand spread as they point downward. The man's right arm appears to be wrapped around the back of the bed. The man has long, curly hair, and he wears a knee-length skirt. His torso twists away from the viewer, showing his bare back. The man's face appears in profile as he looks leftward, toward the spirit, with wide, raised eyes and an open mouth. Like the figures behind the bed, he wears an expression of fear. The walls and floor of the room appear to be bare, and many shadows further darken the scene. They are most prominent along the left side of the spirit, underneath the kneeling man's outstretched leg and behind his back, and in the upper right-hand corner behind the group of kneeling figures on the other side of the bed.</illusobjdesc>

The man's left leg nearly straightens, and it extends almost to the foot of the bed. His right knee bends sharply as he leans backward, and his right foot is flexed to support him. His left arm extends downward and to the left, along his left leg, and the fingers of his left hand spread as they point downward. The man's right arm appears to be wrapped around the back of the bed. The man has long, curly hair, and he wears a knee-length skirt. His torso twists away from the viewer, showing his bare back. The man's face appears in profile as he looks leftward, toward the spirit, with wide, raised eyes and an open mouth. Like the figures behind the bed, he wears an expression of fear.</illusobjdesc>
