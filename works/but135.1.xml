                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>This design shows the death scene of an old man, who is surrounded by his family, and whose spirit hovers over the scene and frightens the gathered mourners. The spirit hovers in the left third of the design, his bare feet pointed and lifted off the ground in the lower left-hand corner, and his body held diagonally toward the bed in the design's center. The spirit wears a long-sleeved gown that reaches his ankles and is gathered at the waist by a belt. A long, looping cloth is suspended in a circle around the spirit's body. It extends over his right arm, which is held away from his body and bent upward. He points upward with the index finger of his right hand. The looping cloth terminates near the spirit's left hand, which rises near his waist as his arm bends in a near 90-degree angle. The left hand is nearly flat, with the fingers pointing down and to the left. The spirit has long hair and a long beard. As he leans rightward to hover over the bed, his head appears in profile, and his eyes stare toward the mourners at right. In the center of the design is a simple wooden bed with a dark blanket that covers the body of the deceased man. Only his head appears; his eyes are closed, and he has the same long hair and long beard as the spirit. Behind the bed are three figures who appear to be kneeling and who react with fear to the man's spirit. They are, from left to right, as follows: a young woman with long hair who stares open-mouthed at the spirit; a young man with short, curly hair who faces left and huddles together with the young woman; and an older woman in a long-sleeved gown and headscarf who extends her arm over the bed, toward the spirit, and raises her palm as if attempting to ward him off. In front of the bed is a partly nude man who kneels on his right knee and extends his left leg forward as he leans away from the spirit. The man's left leg nearly straightens, and it extends almost to the foot of the bed. His right knee bends sharply as he leans backward, and his right foot is flexed to support him. His left arm extends downward and to the left, along his left leg, and the fingers of his left hand spread as they point downward. The man's right arm appears to be wrapped around the back of the bed. The man has long, curly hair, and he wears a knee-length skirt. His torso twists away from the viewer, showing his bare back. The man's face appears in profile as he looks leftward, toward the spirit, with wide, raised eyes and an open mouth. Like the figures behind the bed, he wears an expression of fear. The walls and floor of the room appear to be bare, and many shadows further darken the scene. They are most prominent along the left side of the spirit, underneath the kneeling man's outstretched leg and behind his back, and in the upper right-hand corner behind the group of kneeling figures on the other side of the bed.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>The spirit hovers in the left third of the design, his bare feet pointed and lifted off the ground in the lower left-hand corner, and his body held diagonally toward the bed in the design's center. The spirit wears a long-sleeved gown that reaches his ankles and is gathered at the waist by a belt. A long, looping cloth is suspended in a circle around the spirit's body. It extends over his right arm, which is held away from his body and bent upward. He points upward with the index finger of his right hand. The looping cloth terminates near the spirit's left hand, which rises near his waist as his arm bends in a near 90-degree angle. The left hand is nearly flat, with the fingers pointing down and to the left. The spirit has long hair and a long beard. As he leans rightward to hover over the bed, his head appears in profile, and his eyes stare toward the mourners at right.</illusobjdesc>

The man's left leg nearly straightens, and it extends almost to the foot of the bed. His right knee bends sharply as he leans backward, and his right foot is flexed to support him. His left arm extends downward and to the left, along his left leg, and the fingers of his left hand spread as they point downward. The man's right arm appears to be wrapped around the back of the bed. The man has long, curly hair, and he wears a knee-length skirt. His torso twists away from the viewer, showing his bare back. The man's face appears in profile as he looks leftward, toward the spirit, with wide, raised eyes and an open mouth. Like the figures behind the bed, he wears an expression of fear.</illusobjdesc>
