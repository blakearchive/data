Christ stands at the center of the composition with his arms outstretched and palms out, exposing the stigmata in his hands; the wound in his left side is also visible.  He strides forward with his left foot, also showing a wound.  His head is bent to the right and his downturned eyes look towards the disciples.  Halo-like radiance surrounds his head and upper body.  Three figures bow to the right of Christ.  In the foreground, a gowned, bearded disciple prostrates himself with his face, lower left arm, and left palm pressed to the ground or floor.  Behind him kneels and bows a figure with short, curly hair, arm bent upward, and palms probably together as if in prayer.  The third figure from the front bends forward with his head down.  His hair is curly and perhaps long.  Four figures kneel to the left of Christ.  The front-most figure, a partly nude male with short, curly hair, kneels and sits upright as he looks upward towards Christ.  His arms are bent upward, and his hands are together as if in prayer.  The next figure from the front bows deeply; his head and bent right arm appear below the hands of the front-most figure.  This figure’s hair may be long.  He bends forward, but lifts his eye and hands with palms together towards Christ in a gesture suggestive of prayer.  The third disciple from the front, who has long (?) curly hair, appears above the second figure.  We see only the back and head of the final bowing disciple on the left.  The scene may take place in a room, with only a back wall and the floor pictured.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>Christ</characteristic><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>partly nude</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>striding</characteristic><characteristic>right foot</characteristic><characteristic>feet</characteristic><characteristic>left foot</characteristic><characteristic>tiptoe</characteristic><characteristic>palms out</characteristic><characteristic>fingers spread</characteristic><characteristic>arms raised at 45 degrees</characteristic><characteristic>eyes down</characteristic><characteristic>halo</characteristic><characteristic>stigmata</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>mouth open</characteristic><characteristic>speaking</characteristic><characteristic>muscular</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The risen Christ stands at the center of the composition surrounded by worshiping disciples.  He strides forward with his prominent left foot; his right foot may be on tiptoe.  The muscles of his left leg are clearly visible through his gown.  Christ's arms are extended outward from his sides at 45 degrees, with palms out and fingers spread, revealing the stigmata on his palms.  His gown is draped over his right shoulder, leaving the left side of his breast uncovered and exposing the wound on his left side.  We can also see the wound in his left foot.  With downturned eyes and head bent to his left, he looks down toward his disciples.  His hair is long and curly, and he is bearded.  A halo-like radiant glow surrounds his head and upper body.  His mouth may be slightly open; he may be speaking.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="D"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>disciple</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>palm down</characteristic><characteristic>kneeling</characteristic><characteristic>bowing</characteristic><characteristic>praying</characteristic><characteristic>bending forward</characteristic><characteristic>hand on ground</characteristic><characteristic>facing down</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>prone</characteristic><characteristic>hunched over</characteristic><characteristic>head down</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Three disciples kneel to the right of Christ.
