                The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of fully searchable and scalable electronic editions of the following works related to Blake’s development of his illustrations to Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>: Preliminary Sketches for Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, listed under Drawings and Paintings, Pencil Sketches; Preliminary Drawings for Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, listed under Drawings and Paintings, Monochrome Wash Drawings; and Preliminary Illustrations to Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, listed under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.<lb/><lb/>
                In addition, we are republishing the following works, previously presented in our Preview mode, to make their designs fully searchable: Robert Blair, <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, the 1808 book listed under Commercial Book Illustrations, Designed by Blake and Engraved by Other Engravers; <hi rend="i">Deaths Door</hi>, listed under Separate Plates and Plates in Series, Designed and Engraved by Blake; and Illustrations to Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, the series of twenty finished designs, listed under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.<lb/><lb/>
                Taken together, these works in a variety of media present a comprehensive overview of one of Blake’s major projects as an illustrator and exemplify his working methods as he developed rough sketches into finished water colors.  The evolution of any one design can be traced via links presented under Related Works in the Archive on the pull-down menus, lower left on the main viewing page for each work. <lb/><lb/>
                In October 1805, Blake was commissioned by the engraver and would-be publisher Robert H. Cromek to prepare forty drawings illustrating Robert Blair's <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, a popular "Graveyard" school poem first published in 1743.  Cromek originally planned to select twenty of these designs for a deluxe edition of the poem.  Blake launched into the project with great enthusiasm, rapidly sketching out his illustrations in pencil, developing some into wash drawings, and then producing a group of more finished water colors for presentation to Cromek.  In a first prospectus of November 1805, Cromek names Blake as both the designer and engraver of fifteen designs.  Blake etched one image, <hi rend="i">Deaths Door</hi>, in white-line, but Cromek rejected it.  The dark power of the print appeals to modern tastes, but was far from fashionable in the early nineteenth century.  In a second prospectus, also of November 1805, Cromek announced that Louis Schiavonetti would engrave twelve designs for the new edition.  Blake had lost the potentially lucrative commission to engrave his own designs; his relationship with Cromek descended into anger and argument.  In spite of their disagreement, Cromek included a portrait of Blake as a frontispiece to the volume, published in 1808.  Cromek promoted the book aggressively and the illustrations to <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> became Blake's best known work through much of the nineteenth century. <lb/><lb/>

The scene is backed with a blue wash suggesting sky. From the top center of the design, beams of light emanate downward, suggesting a sun or heaven. To the left of the octagonal box hovers a nude, muscular male figure seen from behind. His body is bent so that he faces left and up. He has curly hair. His left leg is extended down, while his right leg is bent. His right arm is at his side but bent, but his left arm is bent over his head. He holds a partly unsheathed sword. Beneath the figure to the left of the octagonal box is a group of five nude, hovering children, perhaps cherubs. The leftmost child is male and faces left and up. His head is bent back and his legs are crossed. Both of his arms are raised at 135 degrees, palms up. The second-to-left figure is a female with curly hair. Her left leg is slightly bent and may be on tiptoe. She faces forward but her upper body is bent to the right. Her arms are at her side but bent upward with her palms vertical and facing the viewer. The center figure may be a male, facing away and bending down and to the right. His feet are on tiptoe, with his left leg bent. He may be looking at the figure to the right. His arms are raised vertically, with his palms vertical as well. The second-from-right figure is a male with short, curly hair. He faces forward, and looks down and to the right, perhaps at the  adultfemale figure to the right. His feet may be on tiptoe and his ankles may be crossed. His arms are at his side. The rightmost figure of the group may be a male child with short, curly hair, facing away and bending to the left. He may be looking at the female figure to the left. Both his arms are raised at 135 degrees, with his left arm bent; his left hand may be touching the hair of the adult female figure to the left. His mouth is open and he may be speaking. His legs are extended behind him and bent slightly, perhaps on tiptoe. In the bottom left corner of the design is a group of five hovering figures. The leftmost figure of the group may be a male with long, curly hair. He wears a transparent gown. He faces forward and looks up and to the left, with his head bent back. His mouth may be open. His body is twisted so that his lower half faces left and his left leg is seen in profile. His left foot is visible on tiptoe beneath the hem of his gown. His right arm is raised vertically, with the palm up. The second-to-left figure is that of a young woman with long hair. She wears a transparent gown and her body faces forward and to the left, although she looks up and to the right, perhaps at the figure to the right. Her right arm is at her side and she holds the hand of the figure to the right with her left hand. Her legs may be crossed and her left foot is on tiptoe. The center figure of the group is that of a woman with long, curly hair. She may be partly clothed by a transparent cloth that drapes from her waist. She faces forward and slightly left, looking up slightly as well. Her feet are on tiptoe, and her left leg is bent back. Her arms are at her side and she holds the hand of the figure to either side of her. The second-to-right figure in the group is that of a nude male with short, curly hair. He faces forward and bends slightly right and down. His left leg is bent and may be on tiptoe. His arms are at his sides and he holds the hand of the figure to either side. The rightmost figure of this group is a female with curly hair, dressed in a transparent gown. Her right leg is bent slightly and both feet are visible beneath the hem of her gown, with her left foot on tiptoe. She faces forward and bends her head slightly up and to the left. Her arms are at her side, with her right hand being held by the figure to the left. In the bottom right corner of the design is a group of four figures, sitting on a rocky surface. Four chains, the leftmost three unclasped, are attached to the stony earth. The leftmost figure of the group is a nude male, facing away and looking to the left. He has short, curly hair. He crouches precariously with his left leg bent slightly and on tiptoe, and his right leg bent at a more extreme angle. His left arm is raised at 45 degrees relative to his body and his right arm is raised vertically, palm vertical. The second-to-left figure is a gowned male with short, curly hair who faces forward and slightly left, looking up. His mouth is partly open. He sits on a rock or boulder. His arms are raised vertically and bent above his head, with his hands meeting, perhaps in a gesture of prayer or supplication. The second-to-right figure is a muscular male wearing a loincloth around his waist. He faces forward and looks to the left, with his mouth partly open. He has short, curly hair. He balances himself on the rocky ground by kneeling on his bent left leg, while his right leg is extended to the side and on tiptoe. His arms are raised vertically and bent above his head, with his hands together in what is perhaps a gesture of prayer or supplication. The rightmost figure in the group is a nude male with short, curly hair. He crouches with his left leg bent and drawn up, his left foot on tiptoe, and his right leg in a kneeling position. He faces forward but looks up and to the left. His arms are raised vertically, palms vertical and fingers spread, perhaps in a gesture of supplication. His mouth is partly open. Above the group of figures in the bottom right corner of the design hovers a gowned male, his body facing away and upside down. He looks to the right, and has short, curly hair. His right arm is raised vertically relative to his body and his left arm is at his side. He holds in his left hand a key topped with a decoration hinting at a fleur-de-lis design that he may use to unlock the chains of the group below him. His feet are visible beneath the hem of his gown, and his left leg is bent. An aura emanates from his body. In the top right corner of the design hovers a muscular, nude male figure with short, curly hair. He faces forward and looks slightly to the left, smiling. His right leg is bent backward slightly and on tiptoe. His right arm is raised at 135 degrees and he holds a pair of scales in his right hand. His left arm is at his side and he holds a partly unfurled scroll in his left hand.</illusobjdesc><component type="object" location="AB"><characteristic>box</characteristic> <!-- Should we add this search term?
