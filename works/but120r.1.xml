            <updatestmt>
                The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of seventeen pen and ink drawings by Blake. Ranging chronologically from his apprenticeship as an engraver to the final decade of his life, this group offers a comprehensive overview of his work in the medium. Most were created when Blake was learning his craft as an artist and reveal his exploration of various themes and genres. His apprentice drawings for James Basire (<hi rend="i">The Body of Edward I and Countess Aveline</hi>) show his early engagement with medieval art. Another group (two drawings titled <hi rend="i">Figures from a Greek Vase</hi> and <hi rend="i">Charon</hi>) is clearly based on classical art or mythology, responses to which were central to British art and design in the second half of the eighteenth century. The cluster of related sketches on two leaves, each titled <hi rend="i">Four Composition Sketches</hi>, is the earliest extant example of Blake’s attempt to construct a pictorial narrative through a series of images. In these, he began to develop his own version of the sublime, an aesthetic more fully represented by the texts and designs in the illuminated books of the 1790s. Several works from the 1780s show the influence of neoclassicism and take their subjects from two fields of lasting interest to Blake: British history (<hi rend="i">King Alfred</hi>, <hi rend="i">A Woman Enthroned</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Procession of Monks</hi>) and the Bible (<hi rend="i">Saul and David</hi>, <hi rend="i">Goliath Cursing David</hi>, and two versions of <hi rend="i">The Good Farmer</hi>). The three much later drawings are exceptions to Blake’s customary procedures and subjects: a landscape <hi rend="i">Garden Path</hi>, <hi rend="i">The Prophet Isaiah</hi> drawn on a woodblock for a wood engraving never executed, and <hi rend="i">Lady Torrens</hi>, a copy of a family portrait by his friend and patron John Linnell.<lb/>
                <lb/>
                Blake did not execute a large number of pen and ink drawings. This is a bit surprising, given the compatibility between the linearity of the medium and his insistence on “the distinct, sharp, and wirey ... bounding line” as the “great and golden rule of art” (Blake’s <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi>). He did, however, make extensive use of pen and ink work to outline forms in his water colors, color prints, and hand tinted relief etchings in the illuminated books. For preliminary sketching, Blake favored pencil over pen and ink, probably because of the lower cost of pencil and the ease of erasure and correction it offered. The Archive will publish his pencil sketches decade by decade, beginning with the earliest works, 1779 through 1790.<lb/>
                <lb/>
                This is the first time that works from the Society of Antiquaries, London have been represented in the Archive. Accordingly, we are also publishing the Society's Blake collection list, which includes all of its original works by Blake, not just those published in the Archive, and joins the Collection Lists of over thirty other contributing institutions.<lb/>

                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>The general theme and subject of this composition were probably influenced by several biblical passages, including Ruth 2:1-17, I Samuel 12:16-19, and Matthew 9:38.  Several groups of figures appear to labor in an agricultural (wheat?) field.  Three male figures stand or walk in the center of the composition facing right.  The rightmost of these is visible only from the waist up and raises clasped hands in what may be a gesture of prayer.  The central figure, also only visible from the waist up, bends his right arm and extends his left, with fingers spread.  The leftmost figure of this trio, who is gowned, extends his left leg backward and raises both arms at approximately 45 degrees, palms facing up.  He turns his head to the left to look down at the group of three figures in the lower left corner of the scene.  This may be Christ.  Three(?) small figures are positioned above this group, apparently in the distance.  In the lower right corner of the composition, two gowned female figures walk left.  The rightmost figure may carry something in her arms, possibly a bundle of grain, and her companion extends her left leg backward and points down at the ground with her left hand.  Above these figures in the distance is another figure, possibly with arms raised vertically.  Three figures stand, squatting slightly, lower left.  The figure furthest left in this group raised his(?) arms horizontally, hands together.  The figure on the right in this group extends his bent left arm and hand upward, fingers spread.  Above is the head and upper body of a figure, apparently with his(?) left arm bent over his chest and possibly carrying a large object (a sack of wheat?) on his back.  Multiple structures, perhaps a barn or house at left and a silo at right, stand in the upper left corner of the scene.  Vertical lines in the foreground likely indicate the agricultural crop and background horizontal lines suggest additional fields.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>Several groups of figures appear to labor in an agricultural (wheat?) field.  Three male figures stand or walk in the center of the composition facing right.  The leftmost figure of this trio has short hair and wears a gown.  Walking, he extends his left leg backwards and raises both arms at approximately 45 degrees, palms facing up.  He turns his head to the left to look down at the group of three figures in the lower left corner of the scene.  His mouth may be open perhaps suggesting he is speaking to the group at left.  This may be Christ.</illusobjdesc>
