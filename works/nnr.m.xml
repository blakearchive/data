                The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of electronic editions of <hi rend="i">There is No Natural Religion</hi>, copies A, D, and M, from the British Museum, Houghton Library, and Victoria and Albert Museum respectively. They join copy B, from Yale Center for British Art, copy C, from the Library of Congress, and copies G1-2 and L, from the Morgan Library and Museum. The Archive now has all seven extant copies of this illuminated book, making <hi rend="i">There is No Natural Religion</hi> the sixth illuminated book with its entire publishing history reproduced in the Archive, joining <hi rend="i">The Song of Los</hi>, <hi rend="i">Milton a Poem</hi>, <hi rend="i">All Religions are One</hi>, <hi rend="i">The Book of Ahania</hi>, and <hi rend="i">The Book of Los</hi>. The Archive will add <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> to the list later this year. <hi rend="i">There is No Natural Religion</hi> was composed and executed in 1788, shortly after <hi rend="i">All Religions are One</hi>. These were Blake's first works in illuminated printing, though no copy of either work survives from this date. Blake composed twenty plates for <hi rend="i">There is No Natural Religion</hi> plates in two antithetical sets (a and b series). Only copy L consists exclusively of the ten b series of plates. The other twelve recorded copies of this book share impressions of the same group of either eight or twelve plates, which appeared to be merely incomplete sets of impressions until it was discovered that six of these copies were 19th-century reproductions. Once the inauthentic impressions were weeded out, it became apparent that what remained was Blake's selection of a and b plates for an abridged version of the work printed around 1794.   
                <lb/>
                <lb/>
                With the publication of <hi rend="i">There is No Natural Religion</hi> copies A, D, and M, the Archive now contains fully searchable and scalable electronic editions of 95 copies of Blake's nineteen illuminated books in the context of full bibliographic information about each work, careful diplomatic transcriptions of all texts, detailed descriptions of all images, and extensive bibliographies. New protocols for transcription, which produce improved accuracy and fuller documentation in editors' notes, have been applied to all copies of <hi rend="i">There is No Natural Religion</hi> in the Archive. With the Archive's Compare feature, users can easily juxtapose multiple impressions of any plate across all or selected copies of this or any of the other illuminated books and, with the Virtual Lightbox, users can examine any images in the Archive, as well as crop, zoom, and juxtapose them for close study.
                <lb/>
                <lb/>
                In addition to illuminated books, the Archive contains many important manuscripts and series of engravings, sketches, and water color drawings, including Blake's illustrations to Thomas Gray's <hi rend="i">Poems</hi>, water color and engraved illustrations to Dante's <hi rend="i">Divine Comedy</hi>, the large color printed drawings of 1795 and c. 1805, the Linnell and Butts sets of the <hi rend="i">Book of Job</hi> water colors and the sketchbook containing drawings for the engraved illustrations to the <hi rend="i">Book of Job</hi>, the water color illustrations to Robert Blair's <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, and all nine of Blake's water color series illustrating the poetry of John Milton. 
                <lb/>
                <lb/>
                In December 2014, the Archive launched a new wing, which contains searchable HTML and PDF editions of thirty-nine past issues of <hi rend="i">Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly</hi> published from 2000 through 2009. PDF versions present the journal as originally published, but the HTML versions are re-implemented with many full-color images from the Blake Archive, making it possible for users to link directly to those works that have been published in the Archive.
                <lb/>
                <lb/>

may be holding a book or piece of paper from which she reads.  On
the left is a figure—perhaps a young boy—reclining on the
ground but with his torso propped up on his left elbow.  He looks
down and may be reading or writing in a book.  There are two
trees
near the right margin and one or two near the left margin.  Green coloring on the ground suggests grass and possibly hills in the background.  Dark shadows fall to the right of the trees and figures.  The design would seem to relate to
the theme of "Education" (line 3) in the text.</illusobjdesc>

at a young child she holds around the waist with her extended
right arm and hand (left arm not pictured).  The child, also
kneeling and facing right, is probably male; there are no clear
indications of clothing.  He extends his arms horizontally toward
a small bird near the right margin.  These motifs may relate to
the
theme of "desires" first raised textually on plate 7 (line 2).  The
background, right of the woman and above the child, is filled
with
a clump of trees.  A large, leafless tree grows up the left
margin
and spreads a branch between the heading number ("II," line 1) and the
first line of text.</illusobjdesc>

He is facing to the left and reaching with both arms in the same
direction.  His legs are extended horizontally to the left and he
may be holding his knees.  A winged putto, visible from the waist
up, appears behind the seated man's legs.  This second figure
looks
to the right and reaches toward, and perhaps touches, the seated
man's right shoulder with his left hand.  The putto's right arm
is
raised, with one finger of his right hand pointing heavenward.
This gesture, and simply the winged child himself, may indicate
the
spiritual perceptions not available to the "3 senses" (line 3).
Neither figure shows any clear indications of clothing, though the man may be wearing a gown of some sort.  A
slender
tree or vine, intertwined with a second vine, grows up the right
margin and extends in loops horizontally above and below the
heading number ("III," line 3) and terminates in three
spirals.  There may be some plants left of the putto, lower
left.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>A figure, probably male, reclines on the ground with
his
legs extended to the left and perhaps crossed.  He props up his
upper body with his arms.  He holds his head in his left hand in
a
posture traditionally associated with melancholy.  There are no
clear indications of clothing.  He looks down at what may be a
book
held by his right forearm and hand.  The long, spiky leaves of
two
plants, or exceptionally long grasses, arch over his head from
both
the right and left sides of the plate.  A tree grows up the right
margin; its branches and leaves extend horizontally along the top
of the plate.  A vine is entwined around the tree's trunk.  One
tendril of the vine terminates in a lily-like flower just above
and
slightly to the right of the figure's head.</illusobjdesc>
