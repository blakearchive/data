            The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of Blake's 22 engraved <hi rend="i">Illustrations of the Book of Job</hi>. This work is generally considered Blake's masterpiece in traditional line engraving, as well as the culmination of his long pictorial engagement with the Book of Job. His first series of 19 water colors illustrating Job were commissioned c. 1805-06 by his chief patron, Thomas Butts. These are available in the Archive in Preview (see description below). In 1821, Blake and his new patron John Linnell borrowed this Butts set of designs. Linnell traced the series and Blake colored them. Blake also added two more compositions to this later group and added versions of these same compositions to the earlier series, so that both sets now have 21 designs. The Linnell set led directly to his commissioning of the engravings, as set forth in a contract dated 25 March 1823. Blake began the project by executing a series of 21 reduced pencil sketches of the central designs for transfer to the copperplates. According to John Linnell, the border designs, unique to the engraved series, were a last-minute addition. Blake also added a title page, perhaps late in the production process. Although 21 of the plates bear 1825 imprints (the second plate was mistakenly dated 1828), Linnell's account books show that the engravings were not published until March 1826.<lb/><lb/>
            The copy reproduced in the Archive is from the first printing on laid India paper with the word Proof appearing lower right on all but the title page. Also included, as the first item, is a copy of the original letterpress cover label for the Job engravings. Our complete transcription of all engraved texts on each plate is the first to be published in any form. Both these inscribed texts and the designs are fully searchable.<lb/><lb/>
            At present the Archive contains 48 copies of 18 of Blake's 19 illuminated books, all fully searchable. In addition to the Butts set of Job designs, Blake's illustrations to Milton's "L'Allegro" and "Il Penseroso" are also available in Preview, our mode of presentation that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (our image annotation program). In the near future we expect to release a much-anticipated electronic edition of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> Copy E, and further supplementary materials, including a biography and glossary and more drawings and prints in Preview, including the Job pencil sketches noted above.<lb/><lb/>
            As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible through the continuing support of the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia, by a major grant from the Preservation and Access Division of the National Endowment for the Humanities, by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and by the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.

tablet and gesturing with his right hand.  His wife is to the left, 
holding on open book on her lap.  Six of Job's children sit, lie, and 
stand on the right; one holds a scroll, two others hold opened books.  
The seated figures are supported by an odd bench with gothic tracery and 
niches.  The most prominent niche contains a sleeping dog; to the right 
are books.  Two winged angels hover lower left; both hold scrolls.  
Behind the family group are three trees with vines entwined around their 
trunks.  A flock of sheep grazes in the left middle distance; behind them 
is a mountain peak.  Another complex figure group appears in the heavens 
above, partly contained within cloud bands left and right.  At the top 
sits God with a halo behind his head and upper body and an open book on 
his lap.  He points downward with his right index finger to Satan, who 
hovers, striding vigorously to the left, in flames.  Also in the fire 
are the faces of Job and his wife.  Four angels hover on the left side 
of the group; one deposits a scroll before God's throne-like chair, 
another holds an open book.  These figures are balanced by a group of 
five on the right, including another angel placing a scroll before God 
and another holding a scroll.</illusobjdesc><component type="vegetation" location="CD"><characteristic>grass</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The foreground is grassy.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="CD"><characteristic>family</characteristic><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>Job</characteristic><characteristic>old</characteristic><characteristic>sitting</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>left foot</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>arm extended</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised at 45 degrees</characteristic><characteristic>arm reaching downward</characteristic><characteristic>pointing</characteristic><characteristic>fingers spread</characteristic><characteristic>fingers</characteristic><characteristic>knee</characteristic><characteristic>hem</characteristic><characteristic>head up</characteristic><characteristic>eyes raised</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Job sits with his family lower center.

a single bird, possibly disporting in a birdbath; a column of clouds or

at the hands of Satan.  The background is filled with dark flames and, 
at the top, bolts of lightning.  Below are falling architectural 
elements, including at least two columns, and steps.  On and about these 
steps are, just above the bottom margin, a gowned female lying supine, 
perhaps dead, with a lyre at her left hand and a tambourine at her feet.  
In the near foreground on the right is a nude male in an upside-down 
cruciform posture, with large plates and vessels below him.  Another 
upside-down figure hangs just left of the lower right margin.  The other 
figures in the lower half of the design are, from left to right, a group 
of three females clearly terrified (we see only their heads and 
gesturing arms and hands); two females reaching (for succor?) toward the 
male to the right; a large central nude male (whose posture, reversed, 
suggests that of Laocon in the famous classical sculpture) with a child 
on his left shoulder; and a group of five females below the central 
male, all with upraised arms.  Above, a very dark Satan grins in 
terrible pleasure as he rains fire on his victims from his outstretched 
hands.  He is half-kneeling, legs crossed, on stony blocks; his bat-like 
wings dominate the top of the design.  A parodic and spiky halo frames

to tell them of the destruction of their family at Satan's hands.  He is 
gowned, from the waist down, and strides energetically toward the 
couple.  Job raises his hands as if in prayer; his wife lifts her hands, 
interdigitated, above her head.  A ram grazes far right, below the 
(stony?) seat or chair on which Job (and his wife?) sit.  A tree, 
perhaps an oak, rises along the right margin and extends its branches 
and leaves along the top margin of the design.  Two stone pillars form 
the background for Job and his wife; to the left are two grazing sheep 
and, in the background, a clump of trees.  The sky above and to the left 
is cloudy and stormy, an echo of the emotional condition.  Another 
messenger, perhaps nude but wearing a hat and holding a staff, strides 
energetically to the left in the middle background; another messenger 
runs on the hill in the distant background.  Trees and a Gothic 
building, perhaps a church, are pictured in the middle distance on the 
far left.  The foreground, raised into a mound, appears to be covered 
with grass and perhaps a few flowers below Job and his 
wife.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="CD"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>Job's wife</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>sitting</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>left foot</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>arms bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>arms raised vertically</characteristic><characteristic>hands together</characteristic><characteristic>fingers</characteristic><characteristic>praying</characteristic><characteristic>grief</characteristic><characteristic>despair</characteristic><characteristic>breasts</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Job's wife, gowned, sits next to her husband.

lower portion of the central design.  Her right hand is on her breast as 
she leans toward her husband.  Her left hand holds his right upper arm.  
Job holds a rectangular object, probably half a loaf of bread, in his 
right hand.  With his left hand he gives a similar half-loaf to an old 
man with a crutch and a dog on a leash.  Behind the recipient of Job's 
charity is a winged angel.  Another winged angel hovers on the left.  
The near foreground features grass and the leaves of small plants; in 
the middle distance on the left is a Druid trilithon; the horizon is 
defined by distant mountains with clouds above.  The upper portion of 
the central design portrays several dramatic figures, particularly 
Satan.  He is nude, with a slight suggestions of scales over his 
genitals, descending dramatically to the left.  He hold a vial in his 
right hand from which flames (?), perhaps indicative of pestilence, 
descend on Job.  Flames rise from this vessel and extend upward right 
and left, with clouds on their outer margins.  On the left are six 
hovering figures, probably angels although without wings.  Their six 
symmetrical companions on the right are similarly arranged in the 
ascending flames.  In the center of this oval composition, God sits on a 
stone throne, raised on a plinth.  He leans to the left and holds a book 
in his right hand, a scroll in his left.  A large and radiant halo 
surrounds his head and upper body.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="CD"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>gowned</characteristic><characteristic>Job</characteristic><characteristic>old</characteristic><characteristic>sitting</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>legs crossed</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>lap</characteristic><characteristic>fingers</characteristic><characteristic>right foot</characteristic><characteristic>hem</characteristic><characteristic>arm on lap</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised horizontally</characteristic><characteristic>arms bent</characteristic><characteristic>giving</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent upward</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Job sits at the center of the lower portion of the central

afflict him.  He rests is feet against his wife, kneeling and hunched

She is gowned; Job's loins are covered with a rough (burlap?) cloth.  A 
triumphant Satan stands above Job, his feet resting on Job's right thigh 
and abdomen.  Satan is nude, but we can clearly see scales on his hips, 
upper legs, and over his genital area.  His arms are raised 
horizontally; four arrows descend from just behind his right hand.  He 
holds a vial in his left hand from which spills either a liquid or 
flames.  A (mock?) halo surrounds his head.  The background is dominated 
by billowing clouds (of smoke?) and a sun that is rising or (more 
probably) setting over the ocean on the far left.  Ruined walls or 
buildings, a broken cromlech or portal, and broken columns appear in the 
folds of the hills in the middle distance and background.  A mountain 
rises in the horizon, its peak obscured by Satan's body.  A few spiky

these are (from left to right) Eliphaz (or possibly Zophar), Bildad, and 
Zophar (or possibly Eliphaz).  All are gowned.  A few spikes of grass, a

slightly open and tears running down his cheeks and long beard.  He is 
nude above the waist; a piece of rough (burlap?) cloth covers his loins 
and legs.  His hands are down by his thighs, palms out.  The rough 
texture of his flesh, particularly visible on his lower arms, suggests 
the boils that plague him.  His eyes appear to be turned slightly 
upward, as though he is beseeching his God.  His posture, visage, and 
gestures suggest pain and despair.  Job's wife sits far left, her head 
twisted toward her husband.  Her hair is long; her face now looks a good 
deal older than in earlier scenes.  Two tears drop from her right eye.  
Both feet extend from under the hem of her gown.  Her knees are drawn up 
sharply toward her chest, with both arms wrapped around them.  Her hands 
are open, fingers spread, in a gesture that suggests she is questioning 
Job and his fate.  Job's three friends (probably Eliphaz, Bildad, and 
Zophar, front to back) sit, squat, or stand on the right.  They are 
gowned and point accusatory arms, hands, and fingers at Job.  The middle 
distance is filled with a low hill, perhaps covered with vegetation.  A 
small, flowering (?) plant grows on the hill just below the outstretched 
left hand of the front-most friend/accuser.  A bit of vegetation, 
probably grass, adorns the foreground just above the lower margin of the 
central design.  A large pillar, or section of a wall, anchors the left 
margin; much smaller structures, perhaps broken columns and ruined 
walls, appear near the right margin in the middle distance.  The horizon 
is defined by dark mountains; above, the sky is stormy, with dark 
clouds.  The unengraved area in the sky, upper left just above the 
mountains, suggests a feeble light, perhaps from a rising (but more 
probably setting) sun.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>old</characteristic><characteristic>Job</characteristic><characteristic>partly nude</characteristic><characteristic>drapery</characteristic><characteristic>cloth</characteristic><characteristic>loincloth</characteristic><characteristic>kneeling</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>flesh</characteristic><characteristic>disease</characteristic><characteristic>plague</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>tears</characteristic><characteristic>crying</characteristic><characteristic>mouth open</characteristic><characteristic>eyes raised</characteristic><characteristic>despair</characteristic><characteristic>pain</characteristic><characteristic>arms at side</characteristic><characteristic>arms down</characteristic><characteristic>palms facing viewer</characteristic><characteristic>fingers</characteristic><characteristic>fingers spread</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Job kneels, facing forward, on his bed of straw, center

their arms overlap at 135 degree angles.  In light of the 
inscription below the central design ("When the morning Stars sang 
together . . ."), these figures are probably personifications of the stars.  
The middle section is anchored by the ancient figure of God kneeling in 
the center of the design.  His arms are outstretched horizontally.  
Beneath his right arm is a youthful male riding one or more of the four 
horses beneath him.  The radiant disc behind his head suggests that he 
is a sun god, perhaps Apollo.  Beneath God's left arm is a winged female 
holding the reins of two serpents.  The crescent moon above her head 
identifies her as a moon goddess, probably Diana or Hecate.  Job and his 
wife sit or kneel in the lowest section of the design.  On the right are 
Job's three friends.  Given our identifications of the friends in object

gowned angels in attitudes of prayer frame this upper portion of the

extends below the circle or sphere at the bottom.  Job, his wife, and 
three friends kneel on the ground between God and the beastly sphere and 
look down toward it.  Given our identifications of the friends in object

him, with beams of light and cloud bands further from him right and

contains a vision of Satan falling headlong into bolts of lightning and 
the fires of hell below.  The two figures with him have been variously 
identified as his fellow-devils and as the fallen selves of Job (right)

kneel, beholding the vision in the flame.  The landscape in which they 
appear includes some vegetation (perhaps grass) and the suggestion of a 
background hill and, just to the right of Job's wife, a cliff or the 
side of a cave from which issue the fires of hell.  Job's three friends 
kneel, aghast at the vision, lower right.  Given our identifications of

bearded, and long-haired patriarch sits with three daughters (two at his 
side, one kneeling before him).  His arms are raised horizontally to 
point out the pictures on the room's walls.  A rectangular wall picture 
appears above Job's head, with circular pictures behind his hands right 
and left.  All three would appear to represent scenes in Job's own life.  
Like Blake, Job is telling his story visually.  The upper group of 
pictures shows, from left to right, a group of figures fleeing from 
bearded attackers with poles or spears, with a (Satanic?) figure 
hovering above the group; God appearing to Job, his wife and friends, in 
a whirlwind; and a Satanic figure raining lightning and flames on a 
plowman.  The decorative motifs include a band of serpents beneath the 
pictures, vegetative motifs on the plinth or wall behind Job, and 
geometrical shapes on the floor.  The back walls, lower right and left, 
bear two further pictures, each showing a huddled figure (Job's wife in 
despair?).  Above these panels are bearded figures with lightning bolts 
descending from their outstretched hands.</illusobjdesc><component type="structure" location="E"><characteristic>room</characteristic><characteristic>wall</characteristic><characteristic>picture</characteristic><characteristic>circle</characteristic><characteristic>floor</characteristic><characteristic>stone</characteristic><characteristic>marble</characteristic><characteristic>diagram</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Job and his three daughters sit within a room, the three

and reunited, stand and sing or play musical instruments.  From left to 
right they are a youthful male playing double pipes; two of his brothers 
playing horns; another young son playing a curled horn; a youthful 
daughter holding an open pamphlet (a musical score?) and possibly 
singing; Job's wife, playing a mandolin; a young daughter holding a 
scroll (possibly another musical score) and perhaps singing; Job, 
playing a large rectangular harp; a young female playing a lyre; a son 
playing a curled horn and another playing a large harp; and a final 
youthful male holding a pipe, his mouth open perhaps in song.  The 
instruments hung in the tree in the first scene of the drama are now 
used to praise God.  The great (oak?) tree from the opening scene again 
anchors the middle of the design; a sun appears over a distant mountain 
range on the right, and a crescent moon and two stars (or planets) fill
