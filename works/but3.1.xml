            <updatestmt> 
The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of a digital edition of forty-seven monochrome wash drawings created by Blake between c. 1774 and c. 1786.  
<lb/>
<lb/>
The use of monochrome washes to tint a pencil or pen and ink drawing offered eighteenth-century artists several advantages. They could register gradations in tone, from the white of the untouched paper to jet black, without the more time-consuming use of actual colors. No further work was required if the wash drawing was intended as a preliminary for an uncolored engraving. A monochrome wash could also be used to underlie subsequent applications of water colors, thereby darkening selected areas to create the illusion of depth or cast motifs in shadow.  
<lb/>
<lb/>
As the works presented here show, Blake made full use of monochrome washes from his earliest years as an artist. When assigned by his engraving master, James Basire, to record tombs in Westminster Abbey c. 1774-75, Blake applied black and gray washes to tint many of his drawings (Objects 1-5). These carefully executed works could then be used as preliminaries for subsequent engravings by Basire’s workshop.
<lb/>
<lb/>
Blake’s monochrome washes during his first decade as an independent artist and engraver include several interrelated groups. The seven drawings of figures from Michelangelo’s Sistine ceiling (Objects 37-43) demonstrate how copying engravings of works by Renaissance masters helped Blake learn postures and gestures he would later use in his own compositions. Other drawings provide visual evidence of how Blake developed a design from early sketches to highly finished water colors or engravings. The recto/verso drawings, <hi rend="i">Two Sketches for “Joseph Making Himself Known to His Brethren”</hi> (Objects 34 and 35), are preliminaries for the finished water color in the Fitzwilliam Museum, one of three illustrations of the biblical story of Joseph that are among Blake’s finest pictorial works of the 1780s. The three Joseph water colors are in the Archive along with a water color preliminary for <hi rend="i">Joseph Ordering Simeon to be Bound</hi>. The evolution of one of Blake’s earliest original book illustrations, a frontispiece for Thomas Commins’ <hi rend="i">Elegy Set to Music</hi> of 1786, can be traced through three variant wash drawings (Objects 45-47) and a pencil sketch also in the Archive. The four wash versions of <hi rend="i">The Good Farmer</hi> reproduced here (Objects 16-19), in addition to two pen and ink drawings of the subject previously added to the Archive, show the complex ways Blake played variations on a theme as he worked toward a final version. No such finished work is known, and thus these drawings are our only record of Blake’s engagement with this subject. Similarly, for <hi rend="i">War Unchained by an Angel, Fire, Pestilence, and Famine Following</hi>, an untraced work Blake exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1784, we have only a preliminary study (Object 6).
<lb/>
<lb/>
Blake’s illustrations to his poem <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> of c. 1789 are among his most accomplished monochrome wash drawings. These have been published in the Archive as an independent group coordinated with the <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> manuscript.

                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>The composition depicts a side view of Countess Aveline's tomb in
                        Westminster Abbey. The stone tomb has a rectangular base and a pointed,
                        vaulted canopy supported by four pillars at each corner of the tomb. The
                        funerary sculpture of Countess Aveline lies in the center of the tomb with
                        the figure's head at left, facing up. She is depicted with body horizontal
                        wearing a wimple and a gown. Her arms are bent and resting on her chest,
                        where they are clasped, perhaps in a gesture of prayer. One foot is visible
                        beneath her gown at right. Beneath her head at right, an angel is visible.
                        This figure sits facing right with knees bent and has large wings and short,
                        curly hair. The angel's left foot may be visible beneath its bent right leg.
                        The figure appears to support the head of Countess Aveline. At right, a
                        small dog stands or sits near the feet of the Countess. The animal faces
                        away from the viewer but turns its head to look forward. The dog may wear a
                        large collar. The visible side of the base of the tomb is decorated with a
                        scene of six gowned figures who each stand facing forward beneath a pointed
                        arch that resembles the top of the tomb above. The first, third, fourth, and
                        fifth figures from the left are headless, and several other figures' hands
                        appear to be missing or broken. The pointed arch above each figure includes
                        a central circle and several decorative finials. Seven columns or pillars
                        with multiple pointed spires stand between each of the figures on the base.
                        Two thicker stone pillars with decorations of pointed arches on the front
                        stand on the far left and right sides of the tomb. The arch of the side of
                        the tomb facing the viewer above the Countess forms a trefoil-like opening,
                        and the spandrels on each side are decorated with floral and vegetative
                        motifs. The joint of the interior vault is visible just below the apex of
                        this arch. The uppermost arch of the tomb is pointed, but the top is broken.
                        Finials line both sides of the arch, and a trefoil design occupies the top
                        center of the tomb. A brick wall is visible behind the tomb.</illusobjdesc>

                            of the tomb with the figure's head at left, facing up. Her eyes are
                            closed. She is depicted with body horizontal wearing a wimple and a
                            gown. Her arms are bent and resting on her chest, where they are
                            clasped, perhaps in a gesture of prayer. One foot is visible beneath her
                            gown at right.</illusobjdesc>
