                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>The composition depicts a side view of Countess Aveline's tomb in
                        Westminster Abbey. The stone tomb has a rectangular base and a pointed,
                        vaulted canopy supported by four pillars at each corner of the tomb. The
                        funerary sculpture of Countess Aveline lies in the center of the tomb with
                        the figure's head at left, facing up. She is depicted with body horizontal
                        wearing a wimple and a gown. Her arms are bent and resting on her chest,
                        where they are clasped, perhaps in a gesture of prayer. One foot is visible
                        beneath her gown at right. Beneath her head at right, an angel is visible.
                        This figure sits facing right with knees bent and has large wings and short,
                        curly hair. The angel's left foot may be visible beneath its bent right leg.
                        The figure appears to support the head of Countess Aveline. At right, a
                        small dog stands or sits near the feet of the Countess. The animal faces
                        away from the viewer but turns its head to look forward. The dog may wear a
                        large collar. The visible side of the base of the tomb is decorated with a
                        scene of six gowned figures who each stand facing forward beneath a pointed
                        arch that resembles the top of the tomb above. The first, third, fourth, and
                        fifth figures from the left are headless, and several other figures' hands
                        appear to be missing or broken. The pointed arch above each figure includes
                        a central circle and several decorative finials. Seven columns or pillars
                        with multiple pointed spires stand between each of the figures on the base.
                        Two thicker stone pillars with decorations of pointed arches on the front
                        stand on the far left and right sides of the tomb. The arch of the side of
                        the tomb facing the viewer above the Countess forms a trefoil-like opening,
                        and the spandrels on each side are decorated with floral and vegetative
                        motifs. The joint of the interior vault is visible just below the apex of
                        this arch. The uppermost arch of the tomb is pointed, but the top is broken.
                        Finials line both sides of the arch, and a trefoil design occupies the top
                        center of the tomb. A brick wall is visible behind the tomb.</illusobjdesc>

                            gown. Her arms are bent and resting on her chest, where they are
                            clasped, perhaps in a gesture of prayer. One foot is visible beneath her
