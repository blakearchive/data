                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>The general theme and subject of this composition were probably influenced by several biblical passages, including Ruth 2:1-17, I Samuel 12:16-19, and Matthew 9:38.  Christ stands facing right in the center of the composition with both arms extended, at least the right palm facing out to the right.  His right foot is prominent beneath his cloak and gown.  He turns his head to the left to look down toward a group of three figures&#8212;two adults and one child&#8212;who kneel in the lower left corner of the scene.  The leftmost figure, who is female and nude above the waist, reaches both arms toward the standing figure while a kneeling child leans against her bent legs.  The second adult figure also appears to kneel and rest at least one arm by his(?) side.  This figural group may represent a family.  In the lower right corner another gowned figure, seen from the back, appears to walk or run right with both arms extended.  Many other partial and/or indistinct pencil sketches fill the scene, including the suggestion of another small standing figure (perhaps wearing a gown?) to the left of the rightmost figure in the corner, two figures standing above and behind the kneeling group, and, most prominently, another depiction of the central standing figure immediately to the left of the pen-and-ink version.  These figures lightly drawn in pencil may be alternative positions for the more prominent figures outlined in pen and ink.  Horizontal lines near the midpoint of the right side of the composition may suggest a horizon line or distant fields.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>Christ, with long hair and a beard, stands facing right in the center of the composition with both arms raised at 45 degrees, at least the right palm facing out to the right.  His right foot is prominent beneath his gown and elaborate cloak, held with a button or brooch at his right shoulder.  He turns his head to the left to look down toward a group of three figures who kneel in the lower left corner of the scene.  Pencil lines indicate a slightly different position for the figure's arms.  The figure lightly sketched in pencil to the left may be an alternative position for Christ.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>A group of three figures&#8212;two adults and one child&#8212;kneel in the lower left corner.  Partially obscured by his companions in front of him, the rightmost figure appears to be male and, like the female figure, draped below the waist but nude above.  In a posture of supplication, he kneels facing right and rests his left arm by his side with hand on his knee.  He looks up toward the standing male figure.  If this group represents a family, he may be the father.</illusobjdesc>

This figure has long hair and appears to turn its head to look back and up at the standing male figure.  The small stature of this figure in comparison with the others may suggest it is a child.  The figure outlined to the left may be an alternative position for this figure.</illusobjdesc>
