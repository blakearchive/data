    The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of thirty-three of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible.  All take their subjects from the New Testament and have been added to the twenty Old Testament subjects published in March 2010 as “Illustrations to the Bible, c. 1780-1824,” under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.  This new group is presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).
                <lb/><lb/>
                   Blake executed most of these New Testament water colors c. 1800-05 for his patron Thomas Butts.  The exceptions are <hi rend="i">The Whore of Babylon</hi> of 1809 and <hi rend="i">The Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins</hi> in the Yale Center for British Art, datable to c. 1825. The subjects range from the childhood of Jesus to his ascension, the later history of his parents and one of his major followers, St. Paul, and a group of eight designs based on the Book of Revelation.  While the illustrations of the life of Christ are fairly conventional in their subjects, in part because of the long tradition of picturing almost every event in the Gospels, individual motifs recall designs in Blake’s illuminated books and thus offer a window on Blake’s visual interpretation of the Bible. The illustrations of Revelation complement Blake’s intense engagement with apocalyptic events and images in his own poetry.
                    <lb/><lb/>
                        The selection of fifty-three biblical water colors now available in the Archive will be supplemented in the future with early works, such as <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>, datable to c. 1780, and will continue through Blake’s final biblical water colors, such as <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi>. 
                    <lb/><lb/>

Dominating the center of the design is a figure with long hair, standing facing forward, who has been variously identified as John, Christ, and the spiritual form of the Virgin Mary. There is a halo around his or her head. The figure looks up slightly and has arms bent upward and hands together as though in prayer or supplication. He or she wears a gown and bends the right leg slightly forward. The figure is crying, as evidenced by the tears on the face. Below lies the Virgin Mary, facing up and slightly forward. She wears a gown as well as a veil over her long hair. Her eyes look upward at the standing figure, but they are glazed and she may be dead rather than dying. Her body is horizontal with her right arm at her side and her legs together. She may be old. A halo-like aura and beams of light emanate from her. Mary lies on a mattress or bier covered with a patterned carpet that continues onto the floor. Her head lies on a pillow. To the left of Mary kneel two gowned and winged angels, facing right and down, as they bend forward to look at Mary. The leftmost angel is male with short, curly hair. His right arm is at his side but bent so that he may be touching or holding the bedding beneath the Virgin. The rightmost angel is female with long hair. To the right of the design kneel two gowned and winged female angels with long hair, who face left and down as they bend forward, perhaps bowing. The rightmost angel bends her legs underneath her. Her left arm is at her side but bent and she may hold Mary's gown or leg with her left hand. Ten apparently male cherubs with wings and short, curly hair hover in a rainbow above the figures. They all look down at Mary while facing forward and may be smiling. There may be the wing of an additional cherub emerging from the right margin of the design. This scene appears to take place in a darkened room.
