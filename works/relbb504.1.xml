            <note>The woodblocks were executed for Robert John Thornton and the publisher of his edition of 
               *The Pastorals of Virgil*
               , 1821.  Acquired from Thornton by John Linnell, Sept. 1825 (£2.2s.); sold from the Linnell family collection, Christie's, 2 Dec. 1938, lot 60 (£504 to the National Art Collections Fund acting for the British Museum); accessioned by the British Museum in 1939.  The relief etching of Object 6 was acquired at an unknown time by an anonymous collector who inserted it into a copy of Alexander Gilchrist, 
               *Life of William Blake*
               (1863 or 1880); the book acquired in the 1950s by Hugh Fraser; the father of Kevin Vegas; his son; the relief etching removed from the book and sold Sotheby's New York, 9 May 1991, lot 9 ($15,400 to Robert N. Essick).  The proof impressions of Objects 6 and 7 are probably those acquired, c. 1821-25, by John Linnell; by 1921 in the collection of Herbert Linnell; acquired at an unknown time by Lessing J. Rosenwald; given by Rosenwald to the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D. C., in 1945.</note>

               <illusobjdesc>Two shepherds, Thenot (right) and Colinet (left), stand with a flock of sheep between them. The rightmost figure, Thenot, is an older male with long hair and a beard. He stands, with his right foot peeking out from under the hem of his gown, with his right arm by his side and his left arm bent at the elbow, palm raised vertically. Colinet, the leftmost male, leans against a tree on which is hung a horn and a set of shepherd's pipes. He holds a crook in his left arm, which is by his side, and rests his right elbow on the tree, with his right hand on his head. Colinet has long hair and is wearing what may be a transparent gown. Between the two shepherds are a flock of seven grazing sheep.  The sheep fourth from the right may be a horned ram. Behind the figures is a landscape of hillsides, with the sun rising or setting over the hilltops. The roof and the upper portion of a window or door of a small building, possibly a house or cottage, are set into the hills behind the flock of sheep.

In the top image, Colinet, the younger shepherd on the right, stands with his left arm raised, palm vertical and facing out. He holds a shepherd's crook in his right hand. Thenot, the older shepherd on the left, faces Colinet with his arms raised between 45 degrees and the horizontal in what may be a questioning or conciliatory gesture. A dog lays his head on Thenot's right foot. At least three sheep graze to the left and right of Colinet. The sun sets or rises over the hills in the background and a tree trunk frames the right side of the scene.</illusobjdesc>

               <illusobjdesc>This page contains four distinct images. The second image from the top depicts a shepherd who resembles Colinet in previous images, although the text does not support an identification with him. This shepherd is seen from behind and strides or runs to the left with his arms raised. He is pursuing, or at least attempting to scare away, a fox or wolf (the text names both animals) which flees to the left. The body of a sheep (dead?) lies at the figure's feet.  A fox(?) stands to the left of the sheep. To the right of Colinet is a fold with sheep and a small building built between two trees. Another tree rises between the shepherd and the left margin, arching over the fox. The background is hilly with indeterminate leafy vegetation.</illusobjdesc>

He is pursuing, or at least attempting to scare away, the fox or wolf (the text names both animals) which flees to the left.  The figure's left arm is raised vertically with the palm turned away from the viewer and fingers spread; his right arm is bent upward and he holds a shepherd's crook in his right hand.
