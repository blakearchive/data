He is seen in right profile, with his head facing down.  He uses dividers or compasses, which he holds in his left hand between his thumb and at least two fingers.  His left arm must be bent at the elbow, and his wrist is bent downward to hold the compasses.  His right arm is extended downward, and with his right index finger he points toward a line and/or a shadow on the scroll.  Fingers, hands, feet, and right ear (the last partly covered by Newton's curly hair) are carefully delineated.  His left leg is bent back, and his left foot rests behind his right.  His hair is short and curly.  His one pictured eye, the right, looks downward in an expression of concentration.  Although he is nude, drapery (part of a cloak or robe?) falls from behind his body and covers the edge of the unrolled portion of the scroll.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="object" location="D"><characteristic>compasses</characteristic><characteristic>dividers</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Newton holds dividers or compasses in his left hand, and uses them to measure on a partly unrolled scroll.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="object" location="D"><characteristic>scroll</characteristic><characteristic>coil</characteristic><characteristic>coiled</characteristic><characteristic>spiral</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Newton measures on a partially unrolled scroll.
