   The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of electronic editions of Copies A and B of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi>, both in the British Museum. Copy B is here reproduced in color for the first time, and, like all the illuminated books in the Archive, the texts and images of both copies are fully searchable and are supported by our Inote and ImageSizer applications.<lb/><lb/><hi rend="i">Songs</hi> Copy B is one of the first copies of the combined <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>. Along with Copies C, previously published in the Archive (see the update for 9 March 1999), D, and E (forthcoming), it was formed in 1794 of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> plates printed in raw sienna on both sides of the leaf in 1789 and <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> plates lightly color printed in yellow ochre in the same format in 1794. By this time, Blake had decided to move Plates 34-36 ("The Little Girl Lost" and "The Little Girl Found") from <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> to <hi rend="i">Experience</hi>, but since Plate 34 was printed on the verso of the leaf with Plate 26 ("A Dream"), Plate 26, another <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> poem, is placed in this copy, as well as in Copies C and D, in the <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> section. And, like Copies C and D, Copy B is missing Plate 52 ("To Tirzah") but has the small vignette known as plate a (five cherubs and an adult male), one of Blake's earliest relief etchings used here as a tailpiece.<lb/><lb/>
   Blake printed Copy A in 1795 on large sheets of I. TAYLOR paper along with Copy R, previously published in the Archive (see the update for 14 December 1999). This was the first time that Blake printed the <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> and <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> plates in the same session and printed Plates 34-36 as <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> plates. Nevertheless, he apparently meant for the two sections to form separate works. He did not print the combined title plate, printed <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> in grayish black ink and <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> in an olivish light black ink, and stabbed and numbered the two parts as separate volumes. Copy A was produced as part of a set of illuminated books printed on large paper, approximately 38 x 27 cm, and joins other works from the large-paper set now in the Archive (<hi rend="i">All Religions are One</hi> Copy A, <hi rend="i">There is No Natural Religion</hi> Copy L, <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> Copy F, <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> Copy D, <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> Copy G, <hi rend="i">America, a Prophecy</hi> Copy A, <hi rend="i">Europe, a Prophecy</hi> Copy H, <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> Copy R, <hi rend="i">The First Book of Urizen</hi> Copy B).<lb/><lb/>
   As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees.

down the left margin.  Tendrils extending from both margins help separate the stanzas from one
another.  The vine right of the final stanza on the plate has several loops suggesting a spiral.  The
vine full of leaves and flowers(?) that extends across the top of the plate above the title
and  fills the top right corner and the space right of the first stanza is distinct from the flame-like 
vegetation that dominates the rest of the plate.  Extensions of letters in the title (line 2<!--1-->) contribute to both 
forms of vegetation: the initial "A" and "C" to the vine above, the "S" to both.  In the text of the

the "m" of "Dream" in the title—seems to be an arc of tasseled 
grass or grain that curves back over the title.  Beneath it—opposite stanzas 1 and 2—are three or
four clusters of flame-like leaves or tufts of grass.  Below those are a bit of leafy vine (after

                  margin—opposite stanzas 4

staff—probably the "watchman of the night" (line 18<!--17-->), the glow-worm of the text in human form.  
                  He is one of four small human figures on the plate.  The other three are in the area of 
                  the title: lying, presumably sleeping, on the left stroke of the initial "A"; sitting, 
                  perhaps reading, in the "D" of "Dream"; and floating or flying, with arms raised horizontally, 
                  between bits of vegetation beneath the "e" of "Dream."  The animal life of the poem appears in 
                  similarly tiny forms in the margins: there could
be an ant (the "Emmet" of line 5<!--4-->) to the right of line 5<!--4-->, and perhaps another crawling beneath
                 the "her" of line 10; a worm or caterpillar nestled in the

anything other than interlinear and marginal designs.  Beneath its text, beside a tree with leafless
branches that occupies the right margin, are two figures.  At the base of the tree a gowned female
with long hair reclines, her head apparently supported by her bent left arm.  She may be the pretty
rose tree of the poem.  At her feet, facing right and to the right of a tuft of grass, is a second
figure, wearing tights(?) and sitting (or perhaps kneeling) hunched over in a contracted position. 
This may be the male speaker of the poem who "tend[s]" the rose-tree "by day and by night" (line
8<!--7-->).  He holds his visible hand around his head or on his right shoulder.  In the sky between the
two figures are one large and nine small flying birds.  A vine with several leaves springs from the
lower right corner of the design and rises right of the second stanza.  Blue wash suggests sky
behind the figures.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="AB"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>reclining</characteristic><characteristic>head up</characteristic><characteristic>head on hand</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>rose</characteristic><characteristic>melancholy</characteristic><illusobjdesc>At the base of the tree a gowned female with long hair reclines, her head
