            The William Blake Archive www.blakearchive.org is pleased to announce that it has received a two-year Preservation and Access Grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The editors and staff are most grateful for the support it provides as we begin to expand the Archive over the next few years to include Blake's drawings, paintings, and engravings.<lb/><lb/>
            We are also very pleased to announce the publication of new electronic editions of <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> Copies H and I, both in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, England. Printed in 1790 and 1827 respectively, they join copies of <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> in the Archive from other printings: Copies C (1790), D (1795), and F (c. 1794). Copy G, from a c. 1818 printing, and Copy K (Plates 21-24) and Copies L and M (separate printings of "A Song of Liberty") from a 1790 printing are forthcoming.<lb/><lb/>
            The electronic editions have newly edited SGML-encoded texts and new images scanned and color-corrected from first-generation 4 x 5 inch transparencies; texts and images are fully searchable and supported by the Inote and ImageSizer applications described in our previous updates.<lb/><lb/>
            With the publication of these two titles, the Archive now contains fully searchable and scalable electronic editions of 41 copies of 18 of Blake's 19 illuminated books in the context of full bibliographic information about each work, careful diplomatic transcriptions of all texts, detailed descriptions of all images, and extensive bibliographies. They also join our searchable SGML-encoded electronic edition of David V. Erdman's <hi rend="i">Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</hi>. With the forthcoming publication of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> Copy E, the Archive will contain at least one copy of each of Blake's works in illuminated printing and multiple copies of most.<lb/><lb/><hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> Copy H, perhaps the most illuminated of Blake's illuminated books, appears initially to have relied on colored inks rather than watercolor washes for its coloring. It was produced with Copy B in 1790, with plates printed in various shades of red, olive, and green inks on both sides of the leaves. The impressions forming Copy B (Bodleian Library, Oxford University) are uncolored, and those forming Copy H may also have been left in this state originally. But Copy H was sold to the painter John Linnell, Blake's young patron, in 1821 for two pounds and two shillings (less than half of what he was asking for books of similar size and number of pages), and apparently at that time Blake extensively reworked the pages by coloring the illustrations, adding gold leaf (e.g., title page), streaking the background of the texts in yellows and blues, and, what is most unusual, going over the texts in various colored inks, letter by letter, line by line. The results are pages among the most colorful that Blake ever produced and texts among the most challenging editorially, with many key words and phrases visually highlighted (e.g., "Contraries" and "Human existence" of Plate 3 set off by dark ink in lines rewritten in red ink). Such detailed refinishing also resulted in a book with stylistic features characteristic of productions both early (facing pages and plates printed without borders) and late (elaborate coloring and page numbers).<lb/><lb/>
            One stylistic element characteristic of illuminated books produced c. 1818 and later is the frameline, usually one thin line in red or black ink drawn a few centimeters around the image. Copy H has no framelines, probably because they would prove visually jarring for pages that face one another. But they are used to superb effect in <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> Copy I, where they set off each page as a miniature painting. Copy I, printed and colored in 1827 for Thomas Wainewright, was one of the last illuminated books produced by Blake. It was printed in orangish-red ink on one side of J. Whatman paper dated 1825, numbered 1-27, and finished in gold, watercolors, and pen and ink to match Wainewright's copy of <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> (Copy X). It was produced in the same style Blake used in c. 1818, 1821-22, and 1825-26. Works from these sessions include <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> Copy O and <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> Copies Z and AA, which are in the Archive, and <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> Copy G, <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> Copy E, <hi rend="i">America, a Prophecy</hi> Copy O, <hi rend="i">Europe, a Prophecy</hi> Copy K, and <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters</hi> of Albion Copy P, all of which will enter the Archive within the year. Printing plates in full (i.e., with their plate borders), a feature of this late production style, can make pages appear slightly larger and introduce compositional elements missing in copies printed earlier. For <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> Copy I, as well as Copy G, the inclusion of the plate borders introduced the outer lines forming rocks and cavern shapes on Plates 10, 11, 15, and 20, images named in the text but pictured only in these last two copies.

seen from behind, hovers above a burst of flames.  Above them several other figures, mostly embracing couples, fly upward between the flames on

visible below ground, as if seen in cross-section, a couple strolls on the left and a single figure kneels beside another figure lying on the ground.

A heraldic vignette announces "The voice of the Devil" (lines 2-3): 
                  three angels blow their trumpets on either side of these lines.  To the left of the text, two of the angels—one gowned, the 
                  other nude—face up and left; to the right of the text, the third angel, also gowned, mirrors its companions, facing up and right.  
                  A looped, vine-like extension grows from the ascender of "all" in line 4.  Beside the lone angel on the right, a vine rises from 
                  the first letter of "been" in line 4; alternatively, one might interpret the motif as a bird, flying left, whose tail touches the 
                  ascender of "been."  Its fantastic plume contains a single loop, a feature that continues the vegetative motif of the scene.  To 
                  the right of the vine or bird ascends a smaller winged creature, either a bird or an insect, and to its left, three leaf-like flags 
                  extend from the "d" of "sacred" and the "h" of "have" in line 4.  These flags may represent the musical notes of the trumpeters.  
                  Below the winged bird or insect, at the end of line 5, are further vegetative swirls (these are human figures in some other copies).  
                  Further down, to the right of line 7, a small figure, its body and arms horizontal, flees from a recumbent figure on a leaf.  Next 
                  to the words "the Soul" in line 10 are seven figures in sundry positions.  There may be two huddled figures facing each other.  The 
                  figure on the right in this group crouches or squats, reaching an arm out to its companion.  They are followed by two tiny figures 
                  hovering and facing each other.  They may be holding hands.  The hand-holding figures hover above a vine-like streamer extending 
                  from the "M" of "Man" in line 11.  Next to this pair, three figures huddle together on some vegetation consisting of leaves and/or 
                  tufts of grass.  Following the word "Energies" in line 12 are four figures and two animals: the first animal, perhaps a horse, kicks 
                  up its back heels.  Next to it stand two children holding hands, followed by another hand-holding pair, a child and an adult.  The 
                  latter extends his left arm horizontally, perhaps pointing to the ox which grazes nearby on a bit of tableland.  An ornamental ribbon, 
                  most likely vegetative in nature, closes the vignette.  Further down the plate, three leaves grow from the "B" of "But" in line 13.  
                  A branch with spiky leaves grows from the "e" of "age" in line 17.  Following it, an amorphous, horizontal figure hovers above a wispy 
                  line, suggesting a cirrus-like cloud.  The figure raises its arm, seemingly in an effort to make contact with the adjacent figure, 
                  who hovers, legs spread and one arm reaching to the left, above a line of vegetation.  To the right, a man walks a small dog on a leash.  
                  The forms on each side of the man and dog may be the stumps of trees.  Facing left, a lumbering figure, bearded or blindfolded, walks 
                  (runs?) in a contorted position, viz., bending forward from the waist with one arm outstretched in front of him.  Mimicking his general 
                  posture, an anthropomorphic tree arches to the left.  Near the margin between lines 18 and 19 stands a small figure, possibly holding 
                  a cane.  Six or seven figures observe another figure one line down.  With legs slightly apart and arms raised, it appears to address 
                  its audience.  To its back is either a tree with a disproportionally large branch or leaf.  Concluding the procession, two horses, the 
                  second of which is indicated merely by some faint profile lines, pull a figure in its cart.  Background coloring suggests sky, perhaps 
                  as a continuation of the major design below the text.</illusobjdesc><component type="object" location="E"><characteristic>sky</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Background coloring in the text area suggests sky, perhaps as a continuation of the major design below the text.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="AB"><characteristic>angel</characteristic><characteristic>trumpeter</characteristic><characteristic>playing</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>facing up</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>rising</characteristic><characteristic>hovering</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Three angels blow their trumpets on either side of the plate's second and third lines, "The voice of the Devil."

Vegetative motifs flank the plate's second line, "Proverbs of Hell."  The grape leaf to the
immediate right of "Hell" reappears above line 18, where it is attached to a looped tendril.  
Other vegetative designs adorn the plate passim: a long, slender branch with leaves or buds follows 
"contemptible" in line 6; two leaves follow line 14; some flame-like leaves appear in the right margin above 
"and" in line 16; and a branching vine appears left of line 17.  To the left of "Enough! or Too much" in 
line 18 is a small sprig of ivy.  Numerous figures populate the plate, all of which are concentrated in the spaces 
following the text of lines 8 and 14.  After line 8, four figures appear.  Of these, two face each other; at least 
the lower figure appears to be lying on the ground or on a cloud.  A third figure, adjacent to the other pair, lies 
supine(?) on a gentle slope, which resembles a cloud.  To the right, the last figure of this group raises its arms 
                  horizontally and extends one leg backward.  The second group of figures—after line 14—begins (left) with a hovering 
figure holding a leaf.  Behind it is an infant or small child, who is followed by a man and woman, as well as two birds.</illusobjdesc><component type="vegetation" location="E"><characteristic>grape</characteristic><characteristic>leaf</characteristic><characteristic>vine</characteristic><characteristic>loop</characteristic><characteristic>spiral</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The grape leaf assumes some prominence among the interlinear designs on this plate:

                     "Enough! or Too Much" in line 18 is a branch of ivy(?).  More stylized vegetative designs 
                     appear passim: a leaf- or vine-like swirl curves around "As" in line 5.  A long, slender 
                     branch with buds or leaves, recalling a similar motif on Plate 8, stretches to the right

                     above—also vaguely resembles the tendril rising from the gloriosa superba of the major design.

                  text that continues from the previous plate, which describes Swedenborg's self-deceptions: he imagines 
                  "himself the single / one on earth that ever broke a net" (Plate 21, lines 14-15; Plate 22, line 2).  In 
                  this copy, the shape seems vegetative or worm-like.  Beyond this shape, a hunched figure (possibly holding 
                  a book or tablet) sits on a vine.  Following "falshoods" in line 5, a figure clad in a billowing garment 
                  hovers amidst some vegetation.  Below, two elaborate spirals radiate from a common center right of line 9.  
                  To the right of "further" in line 12 are several large, vivid leaves.  Next to "number" in line 17, three 
                  birds soar on extended wings.  To the left of the long-tailed bird and below the small, nondescript bird are 
                  two swollen vegetable forms.  A loop extending above the "h" of "he" at the end of line 18 coincides with the 
                  wing of the largest bird.  Four figures bound the plate's inscription, "A Memorable Fancy" (line 21), on three 
                  sides.  The first figure reclines beneath some leaves and branches to the left of the text.  The vegetation 
                  transforms into loops and squiggles clinging to the margin of the plate.  Above the inscription (line 21), a 
                  hovering figure, arm(s) extended, seems to reach for a serpent.  The four-looped vine growing from the "F" of 
                  "Fancy" and the squiggly "y" of the same word continue the serpentine motif.  To the right of the text, the 
                  third figure of the vignette stands facing right with arms raised at 135 degrees.  His head is bent back, and 
                  his posture suggests he has just been impaled by the invisible arrow released from the bow of the fourth figure, 
                  who leaps through the air brandishing the weapon.  Behind him, a snake or vine coils around a tall tuft of grass.  
                  Further down, a flower with leaves and/or thorns adorns the space following "words" in line 24.  Right of the 
                  flower, a flying bird or insect appears to carry a snake through the air, recalling similar motifs on Plates 5, 
                  15, and 19.  Vegetable forms follow,  with another large leaf or vine extending horizontally below line 26, lower 
                  left.

                  floating behind it.  Alternatively, one might view the figure as facing left, grasping a disproportionally large scrolled 
                  shape; the design would then perhaps illustrate the angel of lines 3 and 4 "embracing the flame of fire."  Next to "Elijah" 
                  at the end of line 5, a gowned figure hovers, facing left.  A winged figure seen from behind hovers in the left margin between 
                  lines 5 and 6; vine-like forms appear to the right.  A serried scene of five sundry figures—flanked by books on the right and 
                  more books, or possibly vegetation, on the left—also appears between the text of lines 5 and 6.  Each of the figures sits or 
                  kneels.  To the left of the first figure is an uncertain shape: possibly the profile of a horse or another figure.  A small 
                  horse (minimally printed in this copy) leaps right above "world" in line 9.  Following "well" at the end of the same line, a 
                  figure runs rightward, reaching for a vertical object which is more clearly a small child in other copies.  The top half of the 
                  plate is dense with interlinear loops, vines, banners, and leaves, e.g., the vines and/or roots on either side of the figures 
                  populating the space between lines 5 and 6; the looped vines growing from the descender of "my" and the ascender of "friend," 
                  both in line 7; the elaborate curlicues following the text of line 11; and the small branch with spiky leaves extending from the 
                  "l" of "also" in line 10.  Wing-like vegetable objects and/or soaring birds grace the plate—above "have" and "whether" in lines

                  Following "dismay" in line 4, a figure holds a staff—or a scepter if one takes him for the "starry" 
                  (Plate 25, line 19) and "gloomy" (Plate 26, line 24) king of this "Song of Liberty" (Plate 25, line 2).  
                  He kneels on one leg and points(?) toward another figure with his left arm, raised horizontally.  Running 
                  amidst wispy clouds, this second figure may represent the "son of fire in his eastern / cloud," who is named 
                  in lines 5 and 6 and in whose direction the king of the text casts his eyes.  Three lines down, two horses, 
                  one of which is mounted, gallop leftward in the direction of another horse(?)—this one recumbent—and an 
                  indistinct form, both of which rest on some grassy tableland.  The horse motif reappears midway down the 
                  design, where two horses flank the inscription "Chorus" in line 14.  The horse on the left gallops or leaps 
                  toward the text.  Its companion rears up on hind legs, arching its head and back.  A small bird soars to the 
                  right of and above "Chorus" (line 14), which is circumscribed by vegetative flourishes, including wavy, 
                  serpentine lines.  Above line 22, a flock of birds—the largest an eagle with head held high—soars on extended 
                  wings.  Various other vegetative motifs adorn the plate, e.g., the looped vines growing from the "t" of "breast" 
                  and the "d" of "accepted" in lines 7 and 17, respectively; a small leaf- bearing branch below "Spurning" in line 8;
