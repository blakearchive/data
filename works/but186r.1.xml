                <objnote><p>This wash drawing, dated by Butlin 186 to c. 1780 on stylistic grounds, is probably a preliminary for a more finished work exhibited by Blake at the Royal Academy in 1784, *War Unchained by an Angel, Fire, Pestilence, and Famine Following* (Butlin 187, untraced).  The inscription lower right on the wash drawing, "June 1783," may have been added later than the execution of the drawing and may not be by Blake.  The verso contains pencil sketches, titled by Butlin 186 verso as *Studies of a Child, for the Frontispiece to Malkin's "Memoirs of His Child"* and dated to c. 1805.  The relationship to the frontispiece in Thomas Malkin, *A Father's Memoirs of His Child* (1806), is far from certain.</p></objnote>

                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>This wash drawing shows groups of figures in the foreground, mid ground, and background, each of which are engrossed in separate scenes of action. In the foreground, a presumably male figure floats or hovers prominently in the middle of the drawing. He twists his torso up and to the right, looking over his right shoulder. His long, curly hair flows behind him, suggesting that he is moving. Both arms are outstretched and his left hand is slightly raised with palm up and fingers extended. His right hand appears to be holding a sword with least four fingers of his hand extended. His legs extend behind him, nearly reaching the right margin of the plate. His left leg extends backward and is raised slightly at the knee and his right leg extends straight outward. His bare feet are visible and his right toes point to the ground. He wears a long gown that may or may not cover his arms and ends in several loops of fabric between his legs. He floats in front of what appears to be a thick, dark cloud or gust of wind. It follows the slope of his body, reaching from his left arm in the middle of the image to the edge of his feet at the bottom right of the image. He holds a flamberge sword, indicated by its wavy, flame-like blade. It is faintly outlined and is held at a 45-degree angle. A brick building stands to the left of the figure. A circular design, perhaps a window, is drawn into the visible right side of the building, near the floating figure’s head. A man, woman, and dead child – probably a family – huddle in what may be an open foyer or other unenclosed portion of the building. Only the upper body of the bearded male figure in the back of the group is visible. His is bent forward and extends his arms to either side, bending them slightly downward as if bracing for action or protecting the other two figures. The right arm is wrapped around the back of the middle, female figure. She kneels on the ground and bends to the left so that her upper body is nearly horizontal. Her visible left arm bends upward at the elbow and her hand is clenched in a fist near her ear. Her head is up and twisted over her shoulder to look behind her. Her hair may be pulled back and she wears a gown. A smaller nude figure, probably male, lies supine over her knees. It may be the child of the male and female figures and appears to be dead. His left leg extends straight and only the upper portion of his right leg is visible. His torso, supported by the female figure’s knee, twists so that his upper body faces the viewer. His right arm falls behind his back and his left arm dangles down the female figure’s leg and onto the ground. His head drops over his left shoulder, facing downward. The three figures crouch on a bare floor and a curtain appears to be parted behind them. A second building appears to the right of the floating figure. It has three visible pillars or columns and is topped by a frieze decorated with what may represent classical art. Although sparsely detailed, a group of figures is visible between the right-most and middle columns. In front, two figures face right and kneel, with their bodies bent forward, arms extended in front of them, and their heads to the ground. A group of at least three figures appear to be fighting behind them. One may hold what appears to be a shield and spear. A wall or other structure appears in the background, between the two main buildings. There are at least two figures stand on the wall. They both hold what may be swords or spears, held up and to the right at a 45-degree angle. They may be fighting with each other or running toward battle on the right. A third figure may be depicted to the left of this pair, also brandishing a sword or spear. The tops of three buildings appear behind the wall; a castle tower rises behind the two figures fighting on the wall, which is flanked by pointed arches on either side. Dark wash that may represent a dark cloud or smoke appears in the upper right-hand corner.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>A man, woman, and dead child – probably a family – huddle in what may be an open foyer or other unenclosed portion of the building. Only the upper body of the bearded male figure in the back of the group is visible. His is bent forward and extends his arms to either side, bending them slightly downward as if bracing for action or protecting the other two figures. The right arm is wrapped around the back of the middle, female figure. She kneels on the ground and bends to the left so that her upper body is nearly horizontal. Her visible left arm bends upward at the elbow and her hand is clenched in a fist near her ear. Her head is up and twisted over her shoulder to look behind her. Her hair may be pulled back and she wears a gown. A smaller nude figure, probably male, lies supine over her knees. It may be the child of the male and female figures and appears to be dead. His left leg extends straight and only the upper portion of his right leg is visible. His torso, supported by the female figure’s knee, twists so that his upper body faces the viewer. His right arm falls behind his back and his left arm dangles down the female figure’s leg and onto the ground. His head drops over his left shoulder, facing downward.</illusobjdesc></component>
