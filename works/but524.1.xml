      <seriesstmt>The William Blake Archive</seriesstmt>
      <updatestmt>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of thirty-three of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible.  All take their subjects from the New Testament and have been added to the twenty Old Testament subjects published in March 2010 as “Illustrations to the Bible, c. 1780-1824,” under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.  This new group is presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).
                
        <lb/>
        <lb/>
        Blake executed most of these New Testament water colors c. 1800-05 for his patron Thomas Butts.  The exceptions are 
        <hi rend="i">The Whore of Babylon</hi>
        of 1809 and 
        <hi rend="i">The Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins</hi>
        in the Yale Center for British Art, datable to c. 1825. The subjects range from the childhood of Jesus to his ascension, the later history of his parents and one of his major followers, St. Paul, and a group of eight designs based on the Book of Revelation.  While the illustrations of the life of Christ are fairly conventional in their subjects, in part because of the long tradition of picturing almost every event in the Gospels, individual motifs recall designs in Blake’s illuminated books and thus offer a window on Blake’s visual interpretation of the Bible. The illustrations of Revelation complement Blake’s intense engagement with apocalyptic events and images in his own poetry.
                    
        <lb/>
        <lb/>
        The selection of fifty-three biblical water colors now available in the Archive will be supplemented in the future with early works, such as 
        <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>
        , datable to c. 1780, and will continue through Blake’s final biblical water colors, such as 
        <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi>
        .

        <illustration location="E" type="plate">
          <illusobjdesc>This water color illustrates Revelation 20:1-3: &quot;I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.&quot; At the center of the design is a male facing away and twisting to face left and down. This is the angel from the text. He appears to be partly clothed in a transparent cloth secured around his waist. He has short, curly hair and raises his arms at 45 degrees. Both arms are bent. His right leg is extended backward and to the left and is on tiptoe, and both legs are bent. In his right hand he is holding a large metal key. In his left hand he is holding a link of a large chain that wraps around a snake-like figure with a humanoid male head that floats or hovers in the center of the design. This is Satan. Satan has a tail and his body is lined with spiky fins and is covered with scales. His head faces right, up, and forward. He has short, curly hair and an open mouth and looks at the angel above him. In the bottom right corner of the design may be at least two human figures of indeterminable gender. The leftmost figure faces forward, left, and up. Its mouth is open and its arms may be behind its back. It may be lying down. The rightmost figure faces forward and left but may be looking to the right. Its one clearly pictured leg is bent and drawn up and its left arm is wrapped around this leg. In the bottom left corner of the design are at least four figures, pictured as heads with hair and perhaps one extended arm of the figure third from the right. Four birds soar above. In the top left corner of the design are at least three human figures of indeterminable gender, facing left, down, and slightly forward. The left arms of two of these figures are dangling. Above these figures are at least six flying birds, facing forward. The sky in the background is dark, suggesting that the scene may take place at night, but a pink wash toward the top left corner of the design may suggest sunrise or sunset.
