                The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of a fully searchable electronic edition of Blake’s 116 water color illustrations to Thomas Gray’s poems. The Archive first published these designs in April 2005 in our Preview mode. This republication substantially increases the number and range of Blake’s pictorial motifs available for searching on the Archive.   
                <lb/><lb/>
                The designs for Gray’s poems are among Blake’s major achievements as an illustrator. They were commissioned in 1797 by Blake’s friend, the sculptor John Flaxman, as a gift for his wife Ann, to whom Blake addressed the poem that ends the series. The commission may have been inspired by the Flaxmans’ seeing Blake’s water color designs to Edward Young’s <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi>, begun in 1795. The Gray illustrations follow the same basic format. Blake cut windows in large sheets of paper and mounted in these windows the texts of Gray’s poems from a 1790 letterpress edition. Blake then drew and colored his designs surrounding the printed texts. Although listed by William Michael Rossetti in his catalogue of Blake’s drawings and paintings, published in the 1863 and 1880 editions of Alexander Gilchrist’s <hi rend="i">Life of William Blake</hi>, the Gray illustrations were virtually unknown until their rediscovery by Herbert Grierson in 1919. They are now among the Blake treasures at the Yale Center for British Art in New Haven, Connecticut.
                <lb/><lb/>
                Blake’s illustrations respond to Gray’s poems in a variety of ways, but always with respect for the specifics in the text. Many motifs are visualizations of Gray’s metaphoric images. The Gray illustrations share iconographic and stylistic similarities with the <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> designs; both series are indebted to the pictorial imagery Blake developed in his illuminated books of the early- and mid-1790s. For the more comic passages in Gray’s poems, Blake deployed a broad, almost caricature-like style. Many of the designs emphasize the imagination at work in the world through inspired acts of reading, writing, and performing music.

The man is probably a personification of "The Pindaric Genius" (see Blake's text, Object 2).  The swan flies
               to the upper right corner, with its neck extended and its mouth open.  It extends its left wing diagonally
               up and to the left, and holds its right wing, slightly folded, down to the right.  Reins extend from its
               open mouth.  Genius sits on the back of the swan.  Seen from behind, he faces away with both
               outstretched arms raised.  He turns his head to the left and bends it back, so that the left side
               of his face is visible in profile.  He raises his left arm at 135 degrees and holds the bottom of a lyre
               in this open left hand, with his fingers extended.  He holds his right arm in a vertical position and grasps
               reins extending from the swan's mouth with his right hand.  His bent right leg is drawn up to the right, 
               while his left leg, slightly bent, extends along the swan's back.  He has short, curly hair.
               Both soles of his feet are visible.  The text box obscures Genius' left thigh and part of his
               left arm near the elbow; it also hides part of the swan's left wing. Blue wash surrounding the swan

               is crossed over his left, which is bent and drawn back so that his left foot rests on tiptoe beneath his
               seat.  He hunches over with his bent right arm lying along his lap and paper resting on his knee.  He

               are bent and drawn under his body, feet balancing on tiptoe.  His lower body faces up, while his torso twists
               away from the viewer.  He turns his head up, bent back slightly, as if he is looking at the Zephyrs above.  His 
               bent right arm is drawn back and braced to the right, with the palm of his right hand resting flat on the roots
               below him.  His left hand is visible beneath his torso, also resting flat on the roots.  He is nude, with
               thick, short, curly hair.  His mouth is open slightly.  The roots supporting his hands and toes represent 
               "the Roots of Nature" (see Blake's text, Object 2), while the bright circle around his head like a halo is the sun in the distance.
               Two Zephyrs appear on the right side of the design, above the head of "the purple year."  They fly
               or hover upside down with bodies nearly vertical.  Both extend their straight left arms vertically past their
               heads and hold their right arms extended straight down by their sides.  
               Eight "rosy-bosom'd hours" fly or hover around the text panel, cavorting with babes representing the 
               "long-expected flowers," which they have "disclose[d]" according to the letterpress text, or carrying items related to
               celebration.  In the upper left corner, an Hour sits facing right within a loop of vegetation, nursing a babe at her
               visible right breast.  Just below this Hour, another hovers or flies facing forward, her legs spread and
               extended to the left.  She carries a lyre beneath her left arm.  An Hour balancing a tray on her head hovers
               or flies facing forward at the left, below the Hour with a lyre.  She holds both arms out horizontally,
               with forearms bent upward, and grasps the sides of the tray with both hands.
               A fourth Hour hovers facing forward below the Hour with the tray; she is holding a babe who nurses at her
               breast.  This babe is emerging from a cluster of green sepals that would surround a flower, attached to a
               nearby vine.  Below this nursing Hour is another who hovers or flies facing away, arms extended.  
               This Hour's upper body
               bends sharply back and to the left, twisting slightly so that her left shoulder blade appears closer to the
               viewer than her right.  A babe kneels on a large leaf just above this Hour's right arm, bending forward towards
               the Hour.  This babe, who seems to be female, holds her arms out vertically to either side.  Four long petals,
               suggesting both a flower and flying garments, extend up and to the right from beneath the babe's lower body.
               Another Hour hovers or flies just below the text panel.  Her body is horizontal, but she bends backward and
               turns to the left, so that her upper body faces forward.  She holds her arms out horizontally.  The vine that loops
               behind her and up to the right displays two blossoms with multiple petals from which babes emerge: one above her
               feet, and the other above her left hand.  Both babes are visible from the waist up.  The babe on the left bends backward
               and to the right, extending her arms above her head to reach toward the Hour's right hand.  The babe on the right,
               of indeterminate gender, descends from the blossom facing down but bending backwards toward the Hour on the left,
               and extends one arm.  Just to the right of the text panel, an Hour stands on tiptoe and stretches up to hold
               a babe overhead.  Facing right, this Hour bends backward slightly and extends both arms vertically overhead.
               She holds the babe at its waist, and its rather limp upper and lower body hang from her hands, which are mostly
               hidden.  One tendril of vine spirals around the figure of the Hour, wraps once around her upraised left arm,
               and spirals into air behind her.
               Near the lower left corner of the design hovers an Hour seen from above, facing down towards the bottom of the design,
               so that the top of its head and nose are visible.  It reaches both arms down towards a babe below, which it holds
               or touches with one hand on either of the babe's shoulders.  The babe below is resting in or emerging from between
               two green sepals, as if it were a blossom.  These sepals belong to a plant that is rooted in the ground near the 
               lower left corner of the design.  The swaddled babe lies reclined with its head furthest away from the viewer.
               Three Hours stand or kneel facing left, in a row on the ground near the bottom left corner of the design.  The Hour
               furthest right kneels resting on knee and tiptoe.  She hunches over, bending sharply forward so that a babe on her lap
               can nurse from her visible left breast.  The Hour in the middle stands but bends forward sharply.  Her left leg is bent
               and drawn forward, while the shape of her gown suggests that her right leg is extended behind her.  She extends
               both arms together, reaching down toward a blossom near her left foot.  The Hour furthest left kneels, bending
               forward.  She holds her slightly bent left arm down, reaching forward towards a babe nearer the lower left corner
               of the design.  This babe hovers between two leaves of a plant rooted below the nearest Hour's knee.  Alternatively,
               this babe may be resting on the rightmost leaf.  Curly vines appear throughout the design.
               One, rooted beneath the legs of "the purple year," grows to the right near the bottom of the design, forming five
               loops of descending size as it nears the right side of the design.  Another seems to be rooted near the bottom
               left corner of the design, growing up and looping to the right.  It has two blossoms from which babes emerge.
               A third vine appears at the right side of the design, above the head of "the purple year."  It grows left and splits
               into two tendrils: one tendril grows up and spirals around the figure of the Hour at the right side of the text
               panel, while the other grows down and to the left before looping back to the right.  This latter
               tendril also carries the two blossoms from which babes emerge on either side of the Hour below the text
               panel.  A fourth vine appears at the top left corner of the text panel, forming a loop above and to the 
               right in which an Hour sits, nursing a babe.  From there this vine grows rightward across the top and then
               down the right side of the design, creating six loops.
               A six-pointed star is poised just below a vine near the top of the design, just above the text box.  This is "Fair Venus" (see the
               letterpress text).  A miniscule bird, described in the text as an "Attic warbler," perches on the vine just
               above the star.  Its head is bent back and its beak is open as if it is singing.  Its tail extends down to touch the star.  Blue wash surrounding the objects
               on the design suggests the sky.

                  their sides.  Each Zephyr holds the right index finger on both of her hands extended as if pointing.
                  The Zephyr on the right bends backwards and bends her head back to look down towards the 
                  bottom of the design.
                  Her legs are extended straight behind her.  Her long hair flies loose behind her head.  She is nude from the

                    left corner, an Hour sits facing right within a loop of vine, her legs extended along its tendril to the right.
                    Her left leg is crossed over her right at the ankle.  She nurses a babe at her visible right breast.
                    Her bent right arm is down, resting along her lap, and she loosely supports the babe's body with her
                    right hand.  She hunches forward over it and bends her head to look downward.  Her hair is short or
                    swept up, and she wears a skirt or gown that begins at her waist, below her breast, and extends to below her
                    knees, falling to rest in folds on the same vine where it curves rightward below.

                  bent left arm out horizontally to the left; her extended fingers on her left hand touch the hand of a babe
                  to the left.  With the wrist, palm, and
                  fingers of this hand she supports the babe emerging from a flower above.  
                  Her right arm is extended horizontally to the right, her forearm bent up slightly.  
                  She turns her head to look forward and left.
                  Her long, curly hair is loose and hangs down her back, visible on either side of her body.  One tendril may drape
                  over her left shoulder.  She is nude from the waist
                  up, with visible breasts, and wears a skirt or gown that begins just below her breasts and covers her hips, but disappears
                  behind her right leg above her knee.  A split in the skirt at the top of her right thigh reveals more of her upper leg.  
                  A small
                  button, bead, or other ornament adorns the top of this split.  A bracelet made of beads or small links 
                  circles her right arm.  The
                  vine that loops behind her and up to the right displays two blossoms with multiple petals 
                  from which babes emerge: one above
                  her feet, and the other above her left hand.  The babe on the left, above the Hour's feet, is visible from 
                  the waist up; the suggestion
                  of breasts may indicate this is a female.  She bends backward and to the right, extending her arms above her 
                  head to
                  reach toward the Hour's right hand.  She emerges from the blossom facing forward, but turns her head to look 
                  up and to the right.
                  The babe holds her right arm vertically and her left at 135 degrees.  Her mouth
                  seems to be open, and her eyes may be closed, or may be poorly delineated.  She is nude and has short, curly hair.
                  The babe on the right, of indeterminate gender, is also nude and visible from the waist up as it descends from the 
                  blossom, 
                  facing down but bending backwards towards the Hour on the left.  It extends its one visible arm, the left, 
                  past its head, resting
                  it on the Hour's forearm.  Its head is up as if it is looking toward the Hour.  Its curly hair may be short, 
                  or may be drawn
                  up or over its right shoulder.

                     Her visible breasts suggest that she is female.
                  Facing right, this Hour bends backward slightly and 
                  extends both arms vertically over her head.  She turns her upper body slightly so that her torso faces 
                  slightly forward,
                  and she bends her head back to look up, so that her facial
                  features are seen from below.  Her legs are together.  She is nude, and no hair is visible.  
                  She holds the babe at its waist,
                  and its rather limp upper and lower body hang from her hands, which are mostly hidden.  The babe's 
                  lower body may be resting along
                  the Hour's left hand and wrist.  The babe's upside down upper body faces away and its head faces down,

                  towards the Hour, with both hands open, palms down.  
                  It has short, possibly curly hair and is of indeterminate gender.  It seems to 
                  be wearing a gown or to be wrapped in draping cloth.  A vine

Of indeterminate gender but probably female, this Hour
                  faces down towards the bottom of the design, so that the top of its head and its nose are visible.  
                  It reaches both slightly bent arms
                  down towards a babe below, which it holds or touches with one hand on either of the babe's shoulders.  The Hour's
                  right hand rests partly on the right side of the babe's head.
                  The Hour's legs are together, bent and drawn up so that the top of its thighs are shown.
                  Its lower left leg also appears, extending away from the viewer, who can also see the top of this foot.  
                  This Hour is nude, and has short hair or a bun.
                  The babe below, also of indeterminate gender,
                  is resting in or emerging from between two green sepals, as if it were a blossom.  These sepals belong to
                  a plant that is rooted in the ground near the lower left corner of the design.  The plant has one leaf.
                  The babe, which seems to be wrapped in cloth,
                  lies reclined with its head furthest away from the viewer.  It lifts its chin to look up at the Hour above.  
                  Its mouth is open
                  and its eyes are raised.

                     corner of the design.  The Hour
                  furthest right kneels resting on knee and tiptoe.  She hunches over, bending sharply forward so that a babe on the ground at her
                  knee can nurse from her visible left breast.  Her left arm is at her side, bent so that her forearm rests on her upper thigh.
                  She is nude and has curly hair that may be short, or may be drawn into a bun.  Her eyes seem to be down or closed.  The
                  babe lies along her knee and thigh, facing right, with its visible right arm stretched up toward her stomach
                  and resting on her thigh.  It bends
                  its head back to bring its mouth to her breast. Its right leg, slightly bent, extends backward with the lower leg resting
                  along the ground, while its left knee is visible on the ground in front of the right.  It is nude, but of indeterminate
                  gender, and has short curly hair.  Two leaves rise from the ground immediately to the left, while
                  a third lies along the ground just below the babe, and a fourth along the ground towards the bottom
                  of the design.  This babe may be emerging from these leaves.
                  The Hour in the middle stands but bends forward sharply.  Her left leg is bent and drawn forward, while 
                  the shape of her gown suggests that her right leg is
                  extended behind her.  She extends both arms together, reaching down toward a blossom near her left foot.
                  Her head is bent back slightly, so that she can look down.  Her eyes are down or closed.  She wears a long-sleeved
                  gown that may be belted at the waist, and has long hair falling in a braid down her back.  Her left foot is visible beneath
                  the hem of her gown.  Just to the left of her left foot grows a blossom surrounded by long leaves.  It is slightly open,
                  and the Hour's hands are inside; her palms face each other and are just slightly apart.
                  The Hour furthest left kneels, bending forward.  She holds her slightly bent left arm down, reaching forward towards a babe
                  nearer the lower left corner of the design.  Her head is bent slightly back, and her eyes are down or closed.  
                  Her hair is drawn back into a bun, although
                  one tendril has escaped and hangs in front of her forehead.  She is wearing a long-sleeved gown, and possibly a belt.
                  The babe to the left hovers between two leaves of a plant rooted below the nearest Hour's knee.  Alternatively, this babe
                  may be resting on the rightmost leaf.  Nude but of indeterminate gender, the babe faces right and extends its right
                  arm in front of him at 135 degrees, up towards the Hour's face.  It bends its head back; its mouth may be open.  Its visible right
                  leg, slightly bent, extends behind it.  It has short curly hair.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="vegetation" location="E"><characteristic>vine</characteristic><characteristic>leaf</characteristic><characteristic>blossom</characteristic><characteristic>grass</characteristic><characteristic>loop</characteristic><characteristic>spiral</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Curly vines with sparse leaves appear throughout the design.  
                     One, rooted beneath the legs of "the

                     of the design, forming five loops of descending size as it nears the right side

                     to the right.  It has two blossoms from which babes emerge.  A third vine appears at the right
                     side of the design, above the head of "the purple year."  It grows left and splits into two tendrils: one tendril
                     grows up and spirals around the figure of the Hour at the right side of the text panel, while the other
                     grows down and to the left before looping back to the right.  This latter tendril also carries two
                     blossoms from which babes emerge.  A fourth vine appears at the top left corner of the text panel, 
                     forming a loop above and to the right in which an Hour sits, nursing a babe.  From there, this vine grows
                     rightward across the top and then down the right side of the design, creating six loops.  Grass covers
                     the ground at the lower left corner of the design, extending about a third of the way across

               right with his lower body extended out to the right.  He leans backward and rests his weight on his right
               elbow, which is propped on a root to the left.  His right arm is bent and down by his side, with his
               forearm towards the viewer and his hand dangling.  He holds a pen loosely betwen his first and second fingers
               on this hand.  His left arm is extended across his lap, and his visible right leg is stretched along the 
               ground, with his knee and the top of his right foot facing the viewer.  He bends his head down.  He wears
               a long-sleeved gown that extends to his knees.  His short hair is curly and wild.
               The "Muse" (see Blake's text, Object 2) reclines half-sitting, half-lying above and to the right of the Poet, facing forward with her
               head nearer the right side of the design and her lower body extended left.  She is resting on a cloud.  Her bent legs are drawn up together with her knees forward.  She lifts her
               upper body, propping herself on her left elbow, and supporting a lyre with her left arm and hand.
               Her eyes are closed; her long, curly hair is loose and drapes over her shoulders, and she wears a 
               wreath of laurels on her head.  She is dressed in a long-sleeved gown that covers her lower body in folds
               of fabric.
               The trunk of an enormous tree rises from behind the poet, near the lower left corner of the design,
               growing rightward as it reaches toward the top of the design.  Above the text box the trunk splits
               into two large branches, which extend into the top two corners of the design.  One root of the tree
               extends to the left of the poet, supporting his braced right elbow, and then curves downward into the water
               below the poet.  An ivy vine ascends the enormous tree trunk from the left side, bearing leaves in three
               bunches.  Grass covers the ground across the bottom of the design, and thin reeds grow upward from the water
               below the poet.  Additional vegetation is visible in the shadow to the left of the tree trunk; this
               may represent branches with leaves.  This part of the tree has been over-painted with dark wash that indicates either deep shadows or a rocky cliff.  Other dark areas near the upper right side of the design may also be rocks; if so, then the setting is cave-like.  Additional dark areas in the water below the poet's leg may be 
               shadow.  The lighter area near the top of the design, between the branches of the large tree, may represent

               facing right and leaning on or climbing onto a stony ledge.  
               He has short curly hair, a curly beard, and prominent fur-like chest hair.
               His right leg is bent and drawn up.  His left leg is down and extended backward, resting
               on knee and tiptoe.  Leaning forward, he extends his left arm down with his hand resting flat on the
               ground over the compressed figure of a fly in human form.  His right arm is bent and drawn back, braced
               with his right hand resting palm down on the knob of a tree over a struggling human fly.  A third smashed
               fly lies draped limply over the trunk of this tree just above Mischance's right hand. Contemplation
               stands at the right side of the design, on the same stony ledge.  He faces left and hunches 
               over slightly, with his head bent
               down.  He is wrapped in a cloak with the hood drawn up, so that his wrinkled face is visible only
               from forehead to nose.  His eyes are closed and his long white beard emerges from inside the hood
               to hang past his arms.  Four human flies fall from Contemplation's shoulders to the ground,
               while one or perhaps two more huddle on top of his shoulders.
               A large boulder or deep shadow behind Contemplation appears above and to either side of him.  A leafless tree grows
               on the other side of the rocky ledge where Contemplation stands, in the lower left corner of the design.
               From wide visible roots its trunk grows upward, then branches off rather sharply to the left,
               leaving a knot or knob to the right.  Mischance rests his right hand on this knob.  The tree bears several
               leafless branches to the left of the text panel.
               Above the tree flies or hovers a human fly of indeterminate gender, facing away and holding a trumpet
               to its mouth.  This fly has two large wings spread on either side of its upper body.  The trumpet
               it holds to its mouth extends away or up, curling in a spiral loop before ending in a bell facing right.
               Ten human flies dance or fly in a circle near the top of the design.  Each fly has arms outstretched
               horizontally to link hands with the flies on either side.
               Blue and yellow washes around the design suggest the sky, perhaps at sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="CD"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>Mischance</characteristic><characteristic>kneeling</characteristic><characteristic>leaning</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent</characteristic><characteristic>arm braced</characteristic><characteristic>arm down</characteristic><characteristic>arm drawn back</characteristic><characteristic>arm extended</characteristic><characteristic>hand on ground</characteristic><characteristic>hand resting</characteristic><characteristic>palm down</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent forward</characteristic><characteristic>leg drawn up</characteristic><characteristic>leg extended backward</characteristic><characteristic>tiptoe</characteristic><characteristic>knee</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>muscular</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>short hair</characteristic><characteristic>chest</characteristic><characteristic>fur</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The nude, muscular figure of "Mischance" (see Blake's text, Object 2) kneels on one knee near the bottom of the design,

                  more crouch on top of his shoulders.  The human fly closest to the ground falls upside down, facing
                  away.  Its wings are spread on either side of its body, and it holds its arms (perhaps bent) over
                  its head at 135 degrees.  Its legs are bent and drawn up.  The fly just above it also falls head first, 
                  facing away, with
                  its left leg extended and its right leg drawn up, so that only its right foot is visible above its buttock.
                  Its transparent wings are folded behind its back.  Both arms are bent upward, held over its head.
                  It bends backward, as if to look out toward the viewer, but covers its face with both hands.  It seems to be nude.
                  A third fly falls head first just to the right.  It is poorly delineated, but seems to extend one arm straight
                  over its head, and to hold the other down by its side. 
                  Above these parallel flies falls a fourth, also upside down.  Facing away, it holds both bent arms overhead.
                  Its head is bent back as if to look down, so that the top of its head is towards the viewer,
                  and it holds both hands near its head.  Both of its legs are extended, with the right 
                  crossed over the left at the ankle.  Its semi-transparent wings are extended to each side.
                  Above Contemplation's shoulders, a fly sits huddled with legs drawn up and crossed at the ankles.  It
                  faces forward but leans left to rest on Contemplation.  Its wings are just visible above its own shoulder.  It
                  may be supporting its head with its bent left arm, bent double at the elbow and propped on Contemplation's hood.  This
                  fly may be nude or may be wearing tights.  Its eyes are closed.
                  A second fly, difficult to distinguish, may appear just to the left of the first that sits on Contemplation's 
                  shoulders.  All three flies in the air seem to have short hair, while the one clearly pictured sitting on 
                  Contemplation's shoulders may be bald.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="CD"><characteristic>group of figures</characteristic><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>fly</characteristic><characteristic>bending backward</characteristic><characteristic>dying</characteristic><characteristic>dead</characteristic><characteristic>hanging</characteristic><characteristic>lying</characteristic><characteristic>facing away</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing up</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>limp</characteristic><characteristic>supine</characteristic><characteristic>upside down</characteristic><characteristic>seen from behind</characteristic><characteristic>head bent back</characteristic><characteristic>head down</characteristic><characteristic>head toward viewer</characteristic><characteristic>arm at side</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent</characteristic><characteristic>arm dangling</characteristic><characteristic>arms crossed</characteristic><characteristic>arms folded</characteristic><characteristic>arm down</characteristic><characteristic>arm extended</characteristic><characteristic>arm resting</characteristic><characteristic>arm wrapped around body</characteristic><characteristic>leg extended</characteristic><characteristic>fear</characteristic><characteristic>pain</characteristic><characteristic>breasts</characteristic><characteristic>upper body</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>short hair</characteristic><characteristic>mouth open</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>wing</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Mischance has smashed two human flies, and a third struggles beneath his weight.  One
                  compressed fly of uncertain gender sprawls on its back and side under Mischance's left hand, and is
                  presumably dead or dying.  Its head is out
                  toward the viewer, facing up and to the right, and its right arm is outstretched along the ground to the right.
                  Its lower body, not well delineated, lies curved around to the right on the other side of Mischance's fingers.
                  This fly's long hair is loose, and part lies spread on the ground.  It seems to be nude.
                  A second fly lies limply draped over the trunk of the tree just above Mischance's right hand.  It is nude,
                  but its gender is difficult to decipher as it faces down, into the trunk.
                  Its upper body hangs upside down, with head down and both arms dangling down past its head, and its spread
                  wings sagging slightly on either side of its body.  Its long, loose hair hangs between its arms. Its left leg
                  is visible extended along the top line of the trunk, but this foot and the entire right leg are hidden.  It may be 
                  dying or dead.
                  A third fly struggles under Mischance's right hand, which is braced palm-down on the trunk of the tree.  This fly is visible
                  only above mid-chest, facing forward.  The fly seems to be nude, and the suggestion of breasts hints that she is female.  She
                  arches her back, bending backward and tilting her head back to look up.  Both arms are down and bent inward slightly,
                  as if she is crossing her arms or wrapping them around her upper body, right forearm above left.  
                  They may be trapped between her torso and the tree trunk.  Her mouth is open, and her face bears an expression
                  of fear and pain.  She may have
                  short hair.  Both wings are visible above her head and left shoulder.

                  face forward and left, but are otherwise indistinct.  The rightmost fly, rather indistinct as well, faces left 
                  with lower body
                  extended backward slightly.  The leftmost fly is slightly more defined, facing right with legs spread wide,
                  the left leg extended forward
                  and right leg extended backward.  A loop above this fly's right leg may be clothing billowing in the air.
                  The four flies forming the lower part of the ring are the most defined. One,
                  who seems to be female with the slight indication of breasts, faces forward with her lower body extended leftward, 
                  and at least her right leg
                  slightly bent.  She has long hair and wears a long semi-transparent gown, both of which billow behind her.
                  The fly to the left of her, also perhaps a female with one breast visible beneath
                  her right armpit, faces away with both legs extended backwards. Her right leg is straight
                  and her left slightly bent.  Lines on this fly's back and buttocks suggest she may be wearing a gown or some 
                  other form of clothing that flies in the air to the left of her legs. She may have her hair in a bun, or
                  have short, possibly curly hair.
                  To the right of the female facing forward is a male fly, who faces away
                  but turns his lower body to face right, with right leg extended horizontally backwards and left leg extended
                  down on tiptoe.  To the right of this male is another fly that may be male, facing away with legs
                  extended leftward.  His right leg is extended and his left may be bent forward.  Both of these males to the

               the design.  His lower body faces right, with knees drawn up, but at the waist he twists his upper
               body to face away.  He is leaning on his left elbow, which he has propped on the tree's roots, and bends
               his head back to look up and to the right.  A curling paper, possibly a scroll, is visible draped over his left forearm. 
               The twisting trunk of the great tree grows up toward the top left corner, where one branch splits off and
               arches rightward over the text panel, becoming several smaller branches that hang back down toward the lower
               right corner of the design.  These branches bear sparse leaves, mostly near their ends.  Another large branch,
               or perhaps the rest of the trunk, continues up from the original split into the upper left corner.
               A grouping of four figures clusters in the crook of the tree that this split forms.  A human fly sits
               facing left on the branch right where it splits from the trunk.  Her legs are bent with knees raised to support
               a child on her lap, who may be suckling.  She hunches over slightly and bends her head down towards the child's.  
               She has two large butterfly-like wings raised behind her back.  To the right of the mother and child stands a piper,
               facing forward and slightly right with legs together.  It is difficult to discern this figure's gender.  Its arms
               are bent upward and it holds a pipe to its mouth.  It has three large pairs of wings, appearing on either
               side of its body from head to
               mid-calf.  Another fly of indeterminate gender hovers or flies above the mother and child, facing down
               with its head towards the viewer.  It holds its arms out horizontally, and seems to extend its legs behind it.
               It has at least one large pair of wings spread wide, but perhaps more.
               A female human fly sits on the top of the text box, facing forward and turning her head to look slightly
               right.  Her legs are bent and drawn up, and she wraps her arms around the outside of her legs, wrists near
               ankles.  She has long curly hair spilling over her shoulders and arms, and at least one, possibly two pairs
               of wings spread wide.  Two small, probably young faces appear facing forward in the enclosure made by her 
               arms and legs.  Another adult human fly somersaults backward off the upper left corner of the text panel.
               It may be female, with the suggestion of breasts.  It is upside down facing up and to the right, with
               arms extended and hands touching the edge of the text box.  It is bent at the waist, and its slightly bent legs
               extend forward and to the right.  Three wings appear to the left of its body, and two to the right.  The
               faint outline of a pair of wings and a body belonging to a tiny additional fly, flying or hovering to the left
               of the text panel, appear just below and to the left of the somersaulting fly.
               Two human flies hover or fly in parallel to the left of the text box.  Both are female
               and have short, curly hair or wear buns.  Both are upside down with their upper bodies facing right.
               Each holds her right arm out straight, down and to the left towards the poet below them, with index finger pointing.  Each extends
               her left arm straight upward, also with finger(s) pointing.  They turn their heads to look down toward the poet.  The 
               leftmost fly has two clearly visible pairs of wings at her back.  Part of a fifth wing may appear just below her
               waist.  The rightmost fly has at least three pairs of wings appearing on either side of her body from shoulders 
               to thighs.  
               A spider web appears to the right of the text box, attached to the tree branches above and to the right and
               to the box to the left.  In the middle of the web a tiny spider in human form appears, brandishing a sword or dagger in its left
               hand, and holding on to the web with its right hand, raised overhead.  It seems to be wearing armor and
               possibly a helmet.  Alternatively, it may be bald.
               A cluster of sixteen flies appears hovering or flying to the left of the tree branches hanging on the right
               side of the design.  
               Blue and yellow washes around the design suggest the sky, perhaps at sunrise or sunset, and perhaps with clouds,
               especially below the text panel.  Mountains or hills appear in the distance in the lower right corner of 
               the design.  The poet is also sitting on a hill or mound, the edge of which appears below and to the left of the mountains.
               A lower area visible in between, below the mountains, may be a grassy plain or valley, or water.  Grass covers
               the hill or mound upon which the poet sits and also the distant mountains or hills.  It may also cover the area in between,
               visible beneath the mountains, if this is land and not water.

                     It may be nude or wearing tights.  It has short, curly hair, or its hair is drawn up.

               facing right.  They both wear long gowns and have long hair extending horizontally behind them.
               Light wash over the top half of the design suggests the sky, perhaps at sunrise or sunset.
               Darker, blue wash over the lower half of the design suggests the water in which the goldfish swim.

               rides each fish.  The angel form on the leftmost fish sits facing right with her legs outstretched to the right
               along the fish's back.  Her legs are slightly bent and her right foot is crossed over her left at the ankle.
               She leans back to rest against the fish's dorsal fin.

               Her legs seem to be bent up away from the viewer.  Alternatively they
               may be stretched out to the right along the fish's back, and end in stumps at her ankles.  She is wearing

               reflection in the water below.  Semi-reclined and wearing a bonnet and gown, Selima is almost fully human in 
               this design, but has a cat's tail, eyes, and ears.  The faint suggestion of whiskers appears on her 
               cheeks, and her hair suggests a cat's fur.  She lies on her left side facing forward, her legs extending
               along the ground to the left.  The text box partially hides them.  She props her torso up on
               her left elbow and forearm, and bends her head down and to the right to look at her reflection in
               the water.  This reflection appears directly beneath her as a sketchily outlined mirror image of her head,
               torso, and arms.  Her tail curls upward in an "S" shape above the text box.  Her right foot emerges
               from the folds of her gown to the left of the text box.
               Blue wash below the bank and surrounding water-plants growing in the lake indicates water, while
               an area left blank along the design's bottom edge indicates the lake's bottom.
               A pair of nude cupids or putti (although one is female) sits embracing on the bottom of the lake in the lower left corner.  They sit side-by-side
               facing forward but leaning left, with legs bent and knees drawn up, and arms entwined.  One batlike wing or fish-like
               fin appears to the left of the pair, and another to the right.  Flowering plants fill the water
               in the spaces between Selima's reflection and the putti.  These plants seem to be rooted in the floor
               of the lake to the right of the embracing lovers.  Their intertwined vines and branches support six
               pansy-like flowers, and many more lily-like flowers, as well as three round berries.  Additional indeterminate
               vegetation may appear to the left of the putti, just to the right of the left edge of the design.

               is female, with the suggestion of breasts.  She swims facing left with her body positioned diagonally from
               top left to lower right, but twists her torso to face forward slightly.  
               Her arms merge into batlike wings or fins: her left arm disappears
               into her left fin at the wrist, while lines in her right fin merely suggest a right arm.  She holds her arms and fins
               out slightly higher than horizontal.
               Her visible left leg is stretched straight behind her.  While her right fin descends at least as far as her pelvic
               area, the left clearly extends past her left buttock, thigh, and lower leg as far as the ankle.
               She is nude and has long curly hair falling to her left shoulder.
               The lower angel form, also nude, has short curly hair that suggests he may be male.
               He swims with body horizontal, facing left, and bends his head back to look leftward.
               His legs extend together to the right: his right leg is straight and his left is bent backwards slightly.  His batlike
               wings or fins are spread wide horizontally out from his torso.  Both fins extend over his left buttock and thigh;
               the left also clearly extends down his lower left leg to the ankle.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="vegetation" location="AB"><characteristic>grass</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Green wash across the bank on which Selima the cat crouches suggests that it is covered

               forward with her head bent back so that her exposed throat and chin face the viewer.  She holds both
               arms up vertically by her head, with her forearms bent away from the viewer and mostly hidden.  Her left leg
               is bent at the knee so that her lower leg is not visible, while her bent but extended right leg is fully
               shown.  She is wearing a semi-transparent gown that reveals both breasts and swirls upward between her
               legs.  Undulant and spiral lines on either side of her body suggest the violent parting of the water.
               "Malignant Fate" (see Blake's text, Object 8) in the shape of an old woman sits at the top of the design, partially hidden by the text
               panel.  Her lower body faces forward and slightly left; the shape of her gown suggests that she is
               sitting cross-legged.  She leans sharply right and down, twisting her torso to face Selima, who is below
               her to the right.  Both arms are outstretched down towards Selima; both hands are open as if she has just
               pushed Selima into the water.  She is wearing a long gown that completely hides her lower body, and a scarf
               or cloth that covers her head and falls over both shoulders.
               Two fish in human form swim in parallel below and to the left of the text panel.  The leftmost fish is slightly hidden
               behind the rightmost fish.  The bodies of both face left, but both turn their heads to look forward and to the
               right; both are positioned diagonally from top left to lower right.  Both hold their arms up vertically.
               The rightmost fish, who seems to be male, grasps a spear with a fishhook for a head in his left hand, and a
               shield with his right hand.  The leftmost fish, who may be female, holds a spear with a fishhook head in her right
               hand.  A second hook appears to the right of her right elbow.  The top of a third spear with fishhook head is visible
               above the shield.  Both fish wear scaly armor.  The leftmost fish also wears a skirt with a thigh-high slit, terminating in a button,
               on the left side.  Their mouths are open.
               Green wash to the left and right of Fate suggests grass covering the bank on which she sits.
               Blue wash across the top of the design above Fate suggests the sky.  Darker wash below the bank on which Fate
               sits, and surrounding Selima and the fish, represents the water of the stream.  There may be clouds upper left.

               he grasps a spear with a fishhook for a head, while with his right he holds the handle of a shield that

               of him.  He bends backward slightly and bends his head down, eyes lowered, to look at the book.  He
               wears a long gown and a crown, and has curly, rather long hair that extends backwards from his head.  An aura of light surrounds his head.  Two boys or young men, presumably students at Eton, stand below the text

               He holds an open book out in front of his torso.  The student on the left stands or steps facing right, with
               his left leg forward of the right, which is extended backwards.  He turns his head to look away.  His right arm
               is down straight by his side, and with his right hand he holds the spine of a large book or folder tucked
               under his forearm.  Both students wear long-sleeved shirts and breeches, stockings, and shoes, as well as the floor-
               length black robes of Eton with slits below the shoulders for their arms to emerge.  The student on the
               right also wears a mortar board with a tassel.  Wash across the bottom of the design suggests grass.  Bushes
               or low trees, lush with leaves, form a backdrop across the design for the two students and Henry the Sixth.  Several
               trunks are visible to the left of the students and to the left of Henry.  The roof of Eton College Chapel,
               with its characteristic spires, appears above the vegetation behind Henry at the right side of the design.
               Wash across the top third of the design suggests the sky, perhaps streaked with clouds.

                 Facing forward and slightly left, he leans right and rests his left arm on an overturned urn.  The waters of the Thames pour from the urn's open mouth.  Father Thames' lower body seems to face left, although only his left thigh
                 is visible, extending left with knee bent.  His right arm is extended leftward, slightly bent, with his right
                 wrist seeming to rest on his left leg below the knee.  He is nude but has long white hair and a long white beard
                 that merge to cover much of his torso and lower body before finally drifting into the river's currents.  He wears
                 a crown or wreath of oak leaves and two acorns on his head.  The water of the river Thames flows from the urn at the right
                 leftward across the bottom of the design.  The near bank appears in the lower right corner and stretches leftward
                 halfway across the bottom of the design.  The far bank of the river shows between the left side of the design and
                 Father Thames' knee.  A small hill rises above the far bank.  The crenelated battlements and walls of Windsor
                 Castle are visible above this hill.  This edifice is clearly delineated to the left of the text panel.  It
                 seems to continue to the right of the text panel, where it becomes a more generalized, organic shape reminiscent
                 of a mound or hill.
                 Six boys or young men swim in the Thames or relax on its near bank at the bottom of the design.  One sits on the top
                 of the urn, just in front of Father Thames' left arm.  This boy faces forward but turns his head slightly left, 
                 sitting with his bent right leg drawn up and his left leg extending down along the curve of the urn to the right.
                 This boy is wearing tights.  Two nude boys sit side by side on the bank of the river, with the boy on the left
                 slightly in front of the boy on the right.  Both hunch over with heads bent down.  The rightmost boy sits with
                 left leg drawn up; the boy on the left crosses his left leg over his right.
                 To the left of the boys seated on the bank stands or walks a fourth boy who is shedding his clothes overhead.  He faces
                 away and to the left, standing or walking with his straight right leg slightly forward and his bent left leg
                 extended backward, his left foot on tiptoe.  He has raised both arms overhead, and the clothing he is 
                 removing wraps his arms, hiding the left below the elbow and the right just past the shoulder.  This material
                 billows in the air to the left and hangs down past the boy's torso on the right.  He is otherwise nude.
                 Two nude boys play in the water below Father Thames' leg.  The boy on the right is visible from the buttocks up;
                 he faces away and to the left but may be turning his head to the right.  He leans forward and stretches his arms out
                 horizontally.  Only the head and arms of the leftmost boy are visible above the water.  He faces forward with
                 arms outstretched horizontally just above the surface of the water, and turns his head to look up to the right.
                 His hair may be long, while all the other boys have short, curly hair.
                 A sailboat floats on the Thames, just to the left of Father Thames' knee.  The near bank of the river is covered with grass; wash on the far bank suggests it may be grassy as well, as is the
                 hill rising beyond.  Leafy trees and bushy indeterminate vegetation lines the hill and the bank.  Several tree trunks 
                 are visible just to the right of the sailboat.  Wash in the top half of the design suggests the sky, perhaps with
                 clouds.

                  with elbow and lower arm resting on an overturned urn.  The waters of the Thames pour from the urn's open mouth.   Father Thames' left hand dangles, with his extended left index finger visible to the left of the urn.

                  resting on his left leg below the knee, and his right hand dangles.  The loosely cupped fingers of his
                  right hand may touch the water of the river.  He turns his head down to the right.  He is nude, but
                  has long white hair and a long white beard that merge to cover much of his torso

               One sits on the top of the urn, just in front of Father Thames' left arm.  This boy faces forward but turns his
               head slightly left.  He sits with his bent right leg drawn up and resting on the urn in front of him, and his left
               leg extending down along the curve of the urn to the right.  His right arm, more difficult to see,
               seems to be drawn in front of his body, resting
               on his lap and along his lower right leg.  His left arm, slightly bent, lies along the top of his left thigh.
               He may be holding a book, which may be partly open, in his left hand.  He is wearing tights with a wide collar,
               and has short curly hair.
               Two nude boys with short curly hair sit side by side on the bank of the river, facing left. 
               The boy on the left is slightly in front of the
               other.  He sits with his right leg bent and down, foot resting on tiptoe, and his left leg bent and crossed over his right
               knee.  His left foot and most of his lower left leg are hidden.  He hunches over with his head lowered and his left arm
               drawn forward; this limb is hidden behind his legs below the midpoint of his upper arm.  He has prominent, well-defined
               muscles, especially in his back and abdominal area.  The boy to the right also hunches over slightly with lowered
               head.  Unlike the other seated boy, this boy's eyes are lowered.
               His left leg is bent and drawn up, foot flat on the ground near his left buttock.  His left arm is entirely
               hidden behind this leg below the shoulder.
               To the left of the boys seated on the bank stands or walks a fourth boy who is shedding his clothing overhead.
               He faces away and to the left, standing or walking with his straight right leg slightly forward and his bent 
               left leg extended backward, his left foot on tiptoe.  He has raised both arms overhead, with his more visible left
               arm slightly bent.  The clothing he is removing wraps his arms, hiding the left below the elbow and the right 
               just past the shoulder; this material billows in the air to the left and hangs down past the boy's torso to the right.
               The shape of his clothing suggests he has drawn his hands together overhead, grasping the material from the inside.
               He is otherwise nude, and has short, curly hair.
               Two nude boys play in the water below Father Thames' leg.  The boy on the right is visible from the buttocks up; he 
               faces left and away, but may be turning his head to the right.  He leans forward and 
               stretches his arms out horizontally, with his hands
               extended with palms down.  He is nude with well-defined musculature in his back, and he has short curly hair.  Only the
               head and arms of the leftmost boy are visible above the water.  He faces forward with arms outstretched horizontally
               just above the surface of the water, and hands extended with palms down.  He turns his head to look up to the right.
               His hair, which may be long, hangs down over his shoulders as if wet.

               stretches across most of the bottom of the design, except where it is hidden behind the tree on the right.  
               The boy faces and
               runs left, though his torso is turned slightly away towards the hoop.  Leaning forward with head up, he
               puts his weight on his bent right leg; his bent left leg is extended behind him.  His right arm is drawn back
               and he holds the stick with which he rolls the hoop in this hand.  Another boy or young man appears to read a 
                book while walking rightward in the lower right corner of the design.  Facing to the right and slightly
               forward, his straight left leg is slightly forward, while his slightly bent right leg is extended backward.
               With both hands he holds a book open before him.  He bends his head slightly and lowers his eyes as if reading.
               A large tree grows up the right side of the design.  Rooted in the lower right corner, the massive trunk of
               this large tree extends beyond the design's right edge as it grows upward to the top right corner.  Near the
               top of the design, two branches split off from the trunk to grow left across the top of the design.  The
               topmost branch bears leaves and several smaller leafy branches.  The lower branch is bare of leaves, and also
               splits into several smaller branches near the left edge of the design.  Vines climb the trunk of the tree near
               its base, some bearing ivy leaves.  A boy lies along the lower, bare tree branch.  He lies face down, with
               his head near the trunk at the right, and hugs the branch with his legs.  His left leg is extended along the
               far side of the branch, with his left foot hooked over the branch, and his right leg is bent and drawn up
               slightly with his right foot hooked over the branch from the near side.  He holds on to the tree trunk
               with his left arm and leans down, reaching with his
               extended right arm towards a girl at the base of the tree.  He is holding a nest with three fledgling birds in this hand; each
               little bird stretches its neck upward and holds its beak open.
               The girl or young woman who stands at the base of the tree trunk faces away and reaches up to the boy above.
               She stands on her tiptoes, her left leg extended backward.  She is raising both arms vertically overhead toward 
               the birds' nest that the boy above holds.  Both of her hands are open and outstretched, with palms up.
               She tilts her head back so that her head and face are seen from above.
               A  hill appears in the background, rising from the edge of the path or road running across the bottom of the design.
               Two large trees grown on this hill, one appearing on either side of the text panel.  Each has a large trunk and thick 
               leaves.  Bushes or other indeterminate vegetation grows to the left of the tree on the right, and between the leftmost
               tree and the left edge of the design.  Grass covers the hill to the path or road, and appears on the near side
               of the path above the bottom of the design.
               Two small, apparently male figures appear in the background near the leftmost tree, just to the left of the lower
               left corner of the text panel.  The figure on the left faces right and stands or walks to the right.  The
               figure on the right stands leaning against the trunk of the tree to the right, facing left.
               Blue wash in the upper half of the design suggests the sky.
               The boy running with a hoop and his hoop both cast shadows on the path.  Shadows also appear along the lower
               edge of the path and on the path where it is visible between the tree and the right leg
               of the boy walking with a book.  This boy
               casts his own shadow, which falls towards the lower right corner of the design.  A shadow may cover part of
               the hill below the tree on the right as well.

               body.  Despair's face appears facing forward above her left hand, with tears cascading down both cheeks.
               A girl playing with a ball stands or walks facing away and slightly left just to the left of the girl holding

               right arm around the boy.  His body fades into Anger, below, who can be seen through Avarice's 
               right arm.  A boy carrying a cricket bat walks to the right in the lower left corner, facing right but turning
               his head to look forward and to the left.  His left arm is down by his side and he grasps the end of the bat
               with this hand.  The human-like figure kneeling on the ground and facing right at the left edge of the design
               represents Jealousy.  He bends his torso rightward and leans on his extended right arm, with his right hand
               flat on the ground.  A snake coils its body around his lifted left arm.  Gluttony appears as a pig's head
               visible to the right of Jealousy's lower body, facing right.  The head is lowered so that its snout
               touches the ground.  Three vulture-like beasts fly or hover in a row above the children, facing left.
               Together the three form a nightmarish mass of wings and claws out of which three heads clearly emerge.
               The text panel partially hides the body of the foremost vulture (seemingly female), who leans or bends down
               with human-like arms outstretched toward the boy with a bat, below.  One drooping breast hangs near the top 
               of her right arm.  A second vulture's head appears to the left of this female, also looking down.  A third
               head looks left, positioned to the left of the middle head.  Three wings appear above the line of vultures,
               and multiple feet with claws are visible between their heads and the rightmost vulture's arms.  A snake emerges
               from the right side of the text box, curving rightward and down to hang above the heads of the children.
               Five birds or winged animals fly in the sky in the top half of the design.  Two to the left of the vulture-like
               creatures, and one above near the top of the design, are simple schematic outlines suggesting the figure of a bat
               or bird.  The final two, just above the leftmost wing of the vultures, are more clearly delineated as birds with
               open beaks and feathered wings.  The wide mouth of what seems to be a cave yawns near the lower right corner
               of the design.  It is dark with shadow.  If this is a cave, then the hill in which it appears may extend leftward
               across the bottom half of the design.  The coloring of the hill and the ground on which the children play suggests
               that both are covered with grass.  Shadows fall on the ground to the right of the girl tossing a ball, the right
               foot of the boy leaping forward, and the right foot of the boy holding the bat.  Wash in the top third of the design
               suggests the sky, perhaps at sunrise or sunset.

               twisted so that the base of his right hand is forward.  His visible right leg is bent and he rests his weight on knee and
               lower leg.  Scales cover his breast while larger armor-like plates appear on his lower torso.  He seems to be nude.

                  Together the three form a nightmarish mass of wings and claws out of which the three heads clearly emerge.
                  The text panel partially hides the body of the foremost vulture (seemingly female), who leans or bends down with 
                  human-like arms outstretched toward the boy with a bat, below.  Her hands appear, palms facing inward, to either side 
                  of the boy's
               head and shoulders.  She holds the index finger of her right hand separate from the others, pointing.
               Her left arm is visible only below the elbow, but her slightly bent right arm is visible all the way up to
               the shoulder, before which a drooping breast hangs.  Her head is clearly birdlike, with wide round eyes and a beak.
               Curly hair grows from the crown and hangs on either side of her face, merging with straighter locks of hair or feathers
               on the right side of her head.  Bony shoulder blades appear above her head just to the left of the text panel.
               A second vulture-like creature's head looms to the left of this female, also looking down.  It has a similar beak and
               round eyes, but where the first vulture has hair, this vulture has two horn-like growths.  Its upper
               body extends upward to the right, as if it is peering down with outstretched neck.  The large wing drawn forward
               above its head may belong to this vulture.  Another wing above and to the left of the text panel may belong to this
               second vulture, or to the first.
               The head of a third vulture
               appears to the left of the second.  This vulture's head looks left, with mouth open wide and long tongue visible.
               It is less clearly delineated than the first two.  Toes with claws appear to the left of and below the middle 
               vulture's beak and to the left and right of the foremost vulture's right upper arm.  A large, feathered wing that
               may belong to the foremost vulture arches up from the upper right corner of the text box, while additional
               wing or tail feathers appear to the right of the text box. A foot with at least two clawed toes emerges

               atop a rocky cliff or hill that dominates the design.  It rises from the lower left corner into the
               upper right corner.  Facing left, he bends forward over his lap and holds his right arm out in front of him, bent upward.
               He clasps a leafy laurel(?) branch with the fingers of his right hand, extending it with a flourish as if presenting or 
               displaying it to the young man below and to the left, scaling the crag.  Ambition's bent left arm is down and
               drawn back, and he grasps a scepter with this hand.  He is wearing a crown and a cape draped over his
               shoulders, on top of a gown or robe.  A young man crawls up the crag near the left side of the
               design, facing right.  His torso is roughly horizontal, but he tilts his head back to look up to the right.
               His left leg is bent and drawn up beneath him, and his right leg extended behind him; he is braced on his
               bent right arm.  He is wearing tights or breeches and a shirt with a wide collar.  A second young man is falling
               headfirst from the top of the crag on which Ambition sits.  His body faces forward but he bends left at the waist,
               so that his legs and arms both extend diagonally leftward.  He turns his head to the left and tips it back; 
               his mouth is open and his eyes are raised to look down.  His legs are spread and bent, and his arms are
               raised at 135 degrees.  He is wearing transparent tights.  A cloth or other drapery billows upward between
               his legs.  A third young man, who has presumably already fallen from the top of the rocky crag, lies on his
               back in a cruciform posture near the lower right corner of the design at the base of the crag.  He may be dead or dying.  His head
               is toward the viewer, tipped back so that his face is visible upside down.  His eyes are half closed.
               His arms and legs are spread wide, and his right leg and arm rest on a nearby rock or stone outcropping.
               The personified figures of Scorn and Infamy kneel together in the lower left corner.  Infamy, an old woman,
               kneels in front.  She faces forward with her lowered head turned slightly right.  She hunches forward and
               extends her left arm at 45 degrees to the right, pointing with her left index finger at the young man to the
               right.  Her right arm, at her side, is bent and drawn back slightly.  She holds her right hand up and points
               with her right index finger toward the young man ascending the crag near the left side of the design.  Her
               mouth is open in a "grinning" (see the letterpress text) smile.  She is balding but has bedraggled gray hair falling from behind her ear over her shoulder.
               The neckline of the gown she wears falls open to reveal part of her left breast.  Scorn kneels behind and to the left
               of her, his body mostly hidden by hers.  He leans slightly left and tilts his head back to look up and to the
               right.  His eyes are widened and his mouth is open to show his upper teeth.  He has short, curly hair and a 
               mustache.  He holds his left arm out at 45 degrees to the right, pointing with his index finger at the
               young man in the lower right corner.  Heavy shadow appears on the ground and the base of the crag between
               Scorn and Infamy and the left edge of the design.
               The ground along the bottom of the plate seems to be stone as well.  Wash above the rocky crag suggests
               the sky, perhaps at sunrise or sunset.

               her left leg is slightly forward.  She hunches forward and extends her left arm out at 45 degrees to the right,
               pointing with her left
               index finger at the young man to the right.  Her right arm, at her side, is bent and drawn back slightly.  She holds
               her right hand up and points with her right index finger toward the young man ascending the crag near the left side
               of the design.  Her mouth is open in a "grinning" (see the letterpress text) smile.  She is balding but has bedraggled gray hair falling from behind her ear over her
               shoulder.  Her visible right ear is extended upward into a point.  She wears a long-sleeved gown with a high waist
               and a wide neckline, which falls loosely open to reveal part of her left breast.  Her visible fingernails are long
               and pointed like claws.

               head back to look up and to the right.  His eyes are widened, with eyebrows raised,
               and his mouth is open as if in an expression of surprise or alarm.  His upper teeth show. He holds his left arm out at
               45 degrees to the right, pointing with his narrow index finger at the young man in the lower right corner.  He
               seems to have long fingernails as well.  His right leg is bent and his right upper leg and knee appear to the left

               bent, with his right hand perhaps resting on the ground near his right knee.  He has short, curly hair and a wide
               curled mustache.  He may be nude, but a line at his left wrist suggests a sleeve, indicating that he may be wearing

               slightly to the right.  Her wrinkled visage and white hair suggest that she is old, though her body is 
               muscled and strong.  Her muscular right leg is bent and her left leg extends diagonally down to the right.
               Each foot rests on top of what looks like a gigantic starfish but may actually represent a star-shaped flame.  She is nude, and an enormous serpent (or several) wrap
               her body, looping twice around her lower left leg, twice around her left thigh, and once around her waist.
               A tail lies across her upper right thigh, falling to rest on the ground between her legs.  Both arms are down
               by her sides, bent forward, and in each fist she grasps a bundle of sticks.  Her right fist
               rests on her right thigh, while her left rests a little lower, on a loop of the serpent wrapped around her
               left upper leg.  Wearing a spiky crown, she has long hair falling over her shoulders.  The dead in the train of the Queen
               of Death form a grisly crowd to the right of where she sits.  They fill the lower right corner of the design
               and extend up past the bottom of the text panel.  One final figure of the Queen's entourage appears
               in the lower left corner, with head tipped back and mouth open.
               Mourners for the dead grieve in the upper left corner of the design, appearing as huddled lowered heads.  The
               heads of three figures are foremost: two women just to the left of the text panel, one of whom buries her face
               in her hands, and one man, with eyes closed, just above these women.  The other mourners are largely indistinct and
               indistinguishable from one another, giving the impression of a crowd of lowered heads.
               A bearded figure, perhaps another god of death, hovers over the scene at the top of the design.  His face appears at the top of the design, looking forward,
               while his vast wings reach to either side of the design.  He is wearing a spiky crown through which strands of hair emerge
               in spikes; below his long hair blows to either side of his face.  He has a long beard that appears above and to the right
               of the text panel.
               Areas of darkness or shadow appear in two different places within the design: along the
               lower left edge to the left of the Queen of Death, and at the upper right side beneath the hovering figure's left wing.
               Indistinct, faintly sketched lines in the area of shadow on the right suggests that more of the dead
               may lurk there.

                  Her muscular right leg is bent, facing out toward the viewer.  Her right foot
                  rests flat on top of what looks like a gigantic starfish but may actually represent a star-shaped flame.  Her slightly bent left leg, also thick with muscle, extends

               entirely.  Her long hair is drawn over her shoulder.  She may be wearing a gown or shirt.  The woman
               to the left also faces right and hunches forward, but lifts her head slightly to look right.  Her
               eye with its furrowed brow is all that is visible of her face.  Like the first woman, her hair is drawn 
               over her shoulder.  She seems to be wearing a cloak over her right shoulder, above another

               the viewer, but otherwise the other mourners are largely indistinct and indistinguishable from one another, giving
               the impression of a crowd of lowered heads.  The head of one may appear to the right of the bald man, just above the top

                  Immediately to the right of the Queen, one of the dead sits facing forward with knees drawn up to his chest.
               He wraps both bent arms around his knees and hugs them, with his hands clasped in front of him just below
               his chin.  With his mouth open in a grimacing smile that reveals his teeth, he turns his head slightly to the right.  
               His bulbous head is bald and his visible right ear pointed.
               To the right of this bulbous-headed figure appears the head and torso of another one of the dead, seen from behind.  He
               faces away, but turns his head to the left so that his face is visible in profile.  He leans
               slightly to the right; his right upper arm is visible raised and extended to the right. His mouth is open to
               display two rows of teeth and his extended tongue.  The muscles in his back and the bones of his spinal column
               are clearly visible, as is the twisted, writhing, noodle-like mass of his exposed brain.
               In the space between his torso and raised upper arm a large eye and part of a nose
               belonging to another of the dead appears.
               Above and to the right of the figure with the visible brain is another figure whose head and left torso emerge
               from a ring of grimacing faces.  This figure faces and leans forward, but turns his head left.  Both of his arms
               are hidden.  He smiles gruesomely.  He is bald but has two rather globular horns atop his oddly short forehead.
               At least eight heads form a ring surrounding him.  Above him appears a face looking up and slightly left.  This
               face has open eye sockets like a skull, and long hair that extends upward.  Above the face with skull-like features
               appears another face seen in profile
               looking up with eyes raised and mouth open.  This face also seems to have hair that extends
               upward and merges with the hair from the skull-like face.  To the left of the figure with globular horns a
               third face looks forward and slightly down.  This face is also tilted backward slightly.  He has long hair
               and a beard, and holds his mouth open.  To the left of this face, below the text panel, diagonal lines suggest
               the effect of hair or possibly clothing belonging to this bearded face.
               To the right and below the figure with horns, three heads facing down appear in quick succession.  
               The leftmost head is visible only below
               the hairline and above the nose.  Its brow is heavily furrowed and its eye looks down.  The head below and
               to the right has mouth and eyes open as if in surprise.  The third head, below and to the right, also holds
               its mouth open.  Its eyebrows are raised.  The middle and rightmost head may each sprout thin hairs, but are
               otherwise bald.  Below and to the right of the horned figure, near the right side of the design,
               a seventh head is visible looking forward
               and to the left, with mouth open.  Lines below and to the right of this head's chin suggest clothing or muscle.
               He may be bald, or may have long hair that extends upward.
               Finally, a head looking upward above the horned figure's left shoulder completes the ring.  This figure's mouth
               may be open, but it is half-hidden.  This figure may also be either bald, or have long hair that falls down towards
               the head below.
               Above the Queen's left foot the head and part of the shoulders of another dead
               figure are visible, facing forward.  This figure has short, curly hair and oddly distended temples.
               His mouth is open.
               Above and to the right of the Queen's left foot a member of her entourage crouches with body facing forward and slightly
               right, but head turned slightly left.  His right knee is raised and he leans to the right.  His left arm, 
               slightly bent, is down by his side, and his right arm is drawn forward and to the right.
               He is bald.  He is smiling and looks down without lowering his eyelids.
               A head seen in profile and facing up appears in the lower right corner of the design.  This head's eyes are raised with brows
               furrowed, and its mouth is open.  It seems to have long hair.  Just above this head, also at the right
               side of the design, appears another that is facing forward and left.  Its mouth is open and eyes raised as well.
               One final figure from the Queen's train of dead appears separately from the rest of the entourage.  The
               head and neck of this figure appears to the left of the Queen's right leg.  The suggestion of long hair
               may mean this figure is female.  Alternatively, the figure may be wearing a hood.
               Her head faces forward, but is tipped back and turned to the right slightly.
               Her mouth is open.

He is leaning
               forward and his weight rests momentarily on his bent left leg; his straight right leg is
               extended behind him.  He has raised his right arm over his head and holds the brim of his hat in this hand.
               His head is bent sharply back and he looks upward.  He is wearing a shirt with a ruffled collar under a coat
               that flies behind him, as well as shoes, stockings, and pants or long breeches.  He has short curly hair.
               A small, indistinct winged creature flies near the right side of the design, below the tree branch.  The young man
               may be chasing this winged creature.  The trunks of at least two large trees fill much of the design space.
               The foremost tree is rooted near the left edge of the design, curving to the right as it grows upward.  Two
               small branches split from its trunk near the top of the design.
               The personification of Folly sits above the running boy in the crook of this tree, near the top
               of the design.  She sits facing forward with knees drawn up, but bends forward and to the right, reaching both
               arms out to the right.  Her right arm is raised horizontally and her left at 135 degrees.  She may be leaning
               or resting her right arm on or against her left knee.  In each hand she holds a vial upside down, allowing gusts of
               wind to escape and blow toward the winged creature.  She looks down toward this wind and opens her mouth in a smile.
               Her long hair is blown to the right.  She may be wearing tights, or perhaps a gown that is wrapped tightly around
               her left leg so that its shape shows clearly.
               To the right of the tree in which Folly sits grows another tree, farther away and partly hidden behind the text
               box.  This tree's trunk also curves to the right and seems to split into several branches as it nears the
               right edge of the design.  Between these two trees the base of a third trunk may appear below and to the left of the
               text panel.  Alternatively this may be a large stone.  Two leafy branches visible to the right of the rightmost
               tree may belong to yet another tree, whose foliage may also include the green wash to the right and left of the rightmost
               tree.  Alternatively this green wash may be a bush.  A strip of brown wash running along the bottom of the plate
               may be earth or sand, perhaps representing a road or path along which the young man runs.  The trees rise from small hills or mounds
               that begin just to the far side of the path and extend into the middle distance.  These hills seem to be covered with
               grass.  Dark wash to the right of the running boy's torso and to the left of the leftmost tree may be hills in shadow.
               Other shadows appear below and to the right of the leftmost tree, below the running boy, and on the tree trunk
               below Folly.  Wash around the tree trunks in the top two-thirds of the design suggests the sky, perhaps with
               clouds.

               He faces mostly left but his body is turned slightly forward.  His left leg is bent down and he rests on his left
               knee and the toes of his left foot.  His right leg is bent and drawn up and his right foot is on tiptoe. He
               bends over and reaches his right arm down past his right leg.  His right hand, palm up, may be resting on
               the ground; his thumb and forefinger curve around the small tee in the ground, on which a ball sits.  His
               slightly bent left arm is down and drawn back, and his left hand is palm down.  He bends his head down and
               looks toward the ball.  He has short, curly hair and is wearing shoes, stockings, breeches, and a shirt with
               a wide, ruffled collar.  He casts shadows on the ground to the right of his body and beneath his left foot; a
               smaller shadow appears just below his right foot.  Some lines just left of his right foot indicate a slightly different position for it.
               A smaller ball or marble lies on the ground to the left of the one resting on a tee.
               Two boys or young men stand shoulder to shoulder to the left of the text box.  The young man on the right
            stands facing forward, but turns his head down and to the right.  His eyes are lowered.  He stands with his left
            leg straight and his right bent forward slightly.  His left arm is down by his side, while his right is mostly
            hidden behind his companion to the left.  He wears a shirt with a wide, ruffled collar, a tailcoat, and breeches
            over stockings and slim shoes.  He has short, curly hair.  The young man to the left stands facing forward and
            slightly right.  Like his companion, his bent head is turned to the right and his eyes are lowered to look at the
            boy who kneels to the right.  His left leg is crossed over his right leg and his left foot rests on tiptoe.  He holds
            his right arm bent behind his back and raises his left horizontally to embrace the shoulders of the young man to
            the right.  The fingers of the leftmost young man's left hand appear resting on the left shoulder of his fellow.
            He wears a shirt with a ruffled collar under a waistcoat and breeches.  Alternatively he may be wearing knee-length
            tights with a wide neck through which his shirt shows.  He is also wearing a tailcoat, stockings, and shoes.  His hair
            is long and curly, and may be tied loosely behind his head.  Shadows appear on the ground beneath the boy on the right
            and to the left of the boy on the left.
            A large tree, rooted in the lower right corner, grows up the right side of the design.  Near the upper right corner,
            the trunk splits into two.  One branch or section of the trunk grows to the right, out of the design.  The other,
            a large branch, arches to the left across the top and down towards the left edge of the design.  Smaller branches
            fill the spaces between the large branch, the standing boys, and the text panel.  All of the branches are
            bare of leaves. Streaks of blue wash in the upper half of the design suggest the sky, perhaps with clouds.
            The ground on which the young men stand or kneel seems to be bare earth.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="AC"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>young</characteristic><characteristic>embracing</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>touching</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>facing down</characteristic><characteristic>head down</characteristic><characteristic>eyes lowered</characteristic><characteristic>arm at side</characteristic><characteristic>arm behind back</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent</characteristic><characteristic>arm down</characteristic><characteristic>arm extended</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised horizontally</characteristic><characteristic>hand resting</characteristic><characteristic>fingers</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent forward</characteristic><characteristic>legs crossed</characteristic><characteristic>tiptoe</characteristic><characteristic>coat</characteristic><characteristic>collar</characteristic><characteristic>pants</characteristic><characteristic>breeches</characteristic><characteristic>tights</characteristic><characteristic>shirt</characteristic><characteristic>shoe</characteristic><characteristic>stockings</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>short hair</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>shadow</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Two boys or young men stand shoulder to shoulder to the left of the text box.

               in a ring encircling the text panel.  The nude young man or boy appears below the text panel and is
               seen from behind.  His upper body faces away but his head faces left and his lower body is turned to face
               right.  His arms are outstretched horizontally and each hand holds the hand of a figure
               to the right or left.  He has drawn his bent left leg forward, while his straight right leg is extended
               behind him.  A young woman appears to the right of the text panel, seen from behind.  Her lower body
               faces away and slightly to the right; her right leg is extended down and drawn slightly behind her, and her left leg
               is bent at the knee and drawn forward slightly.  She bends sharply left, turning her upper body to face down and
               bending her head down as well.  Her right arm is raised vertically and she holds the hand of another figure above
               her.  Her left arm is extended down, at slightly lower than 45 degrees.  With her left hand she holds the right
               hand of the nude young man beneath the text panel.  She wears a semi-transparent gown, and her hair is drawn
               up into a bun wrapped in a braid.
               A second young woman appears above the top right corner of the text panel.  She is seen from behind on a diagonal,
               her body contorted around the corner of the text panel.  Her lower body faces right.  Her slightly bent right leg
               is extended down, while her left leg is bent up away from the viewer, though her pelvis faces right.  She twists
               sharply away at the waist so that her upper body faces left and down.  She extends her left arm down to hold the
               hand of the female below, and stretches her right arm overhead to the left, reaching her right hand towards the
               hand of a female to the left.  Her upper body is nude, and she wears tights or pants below, as well as slim shoes.
               Her curly hair is short or piled on the top of her head in a bun.
               The third young woman appears above the text panel, upside down and with her body almost horizontal.  She
               faces up, but bends backward slightly so that her upper body faces left and out toward the viewer.  Her head may
               be bent back slightly.  She holds her right arm out horizontally, reaching her open hand toward the figure to the
               right, and raises her left arm vertically over her head, down toward the figure below her.  With her left hand
               she may be holding the hand of the figure below; alternatively, this hand may be merely stretched in this direction.
               Her right leg is extended horizontally across the design, while her left is bent and drawn up, knee to torso.
               She wears a long, semi-transparent gown or skirt that drapes her legs but allows both feet, clad in slim shoes,
               to emerge.  This garment also leaves her breasts bare.  Her hair is curly and short or drawn back into a bun.
               The fourth young woman appears upside down to the left of the text panel.  She faces forward and left, but may
               also bend forward slightly, lowering her head to look up.  Her right leg is extended, while her left is bent
               and drawn up, knee to torso.  She extends her slightly bent right arm to hold the hand of the figure above her,
               and raises her bent left arm over her head to hold the hand of the figure below.  She wears a long, semi-transparent
               gown or skirt that covers her legs but leaves her upper body and breasts bare.  She has short hair or wears it
               in a bun.

The woman, who stands
               near the middle of the panel's top edge, faces forward but turns her head to look left.  She stands
               in a contrapposto position, with her weight resting on her right leg and her left bent forward.  Her arms
               are down by her side and she may be holding hands with the children to either side.  A male child, indistinctly
               drawn, stands to the left of this woman, facing forward and right with legs together.  His right arm is down
               by his side, but he raises his left arm, probably to hold the woman's right hand.  Another child stands
               to the right of the woman, facing left.  This child is even more indistinct, but may be male.  He may raise
               one of his hands to hold the woman's left hand.  To the right of this child, another male child stands or
               dances on tiptoe while playing a fife or flute.  He faces forward and slightly right, bending his head
               down to the mouthpiece of the flute, and raises both bent arms out to the right to support the instrument.
               His right leg is forward, while his left is drawn back to the left.  To the right, near the top right corner
               of the text panel, stands or dances a girl holding a tambourine or drum.  She faces forward and slightly right,
               but turns her head slightly left.  Her extended left arm is raised at 135 degrees, and she holds the tambourine or drum
               up with this hand.  Her right arm is bent across her torso; she grasps the stick with which she plays the tambourine or drum
               in her right hand.  Her left leg may be extended behind her to the left.
               A wasp or bee flies to the left of the text panel, facing right.  A diminutive figure sits astride the wasp, with
               its straight legs extended forward along either side of the wasp's thorax.  The figure leans
               forward slightly and extends its right arm horizontally forward, holding a stinger(?) out toward the text.
               This figure wears tights and a hat with two antennae curling backward from its head.  These antennae mimic the
               antennae of the wasp.  A large butterfly flies or hovers with wings spread beneath the text panel.  A woman,
               probably a fairy (see "Fairies," Blake's text, Object 22), is suspended or carried before the butterfly.  She faces forward with a wide smile and
               extends her arms, slightly bent, at 135 degrees.  Both hands are open with palms up; the fingers of her right
               hand are also parted.  Her legs are spread and slightly bent; the right leg is slightly forward, while the left
               is drawn slightly back.  Long curly hair spills down her back and shows on either side of her torso.  She wears
               a semi-transparent long-sleeved gown with diaphanous skirts floating around her legs.  Her right breast may
               be bare.  Though the fairy woman obscures most of the butterfly's body, its large, hairy antennae appear
               above her head and the bottom of its abdomen is visible below her skirts.
               Wash across the top of the design suggests the sky, perhaps streaked with clouds.

                  right breast may be bare.
                  Though the fairy woman obscures most of the butterfly's body, its large, hairy antennae appear above her head
               and the bottom of its abdomen is visible below her skirts.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="object" location="AB"><characteristic>sky</characteristic><characteristic>cloud</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Wash across the top of the design suggests the sky, perhaps streaked with clouds.</illusobjdesc></component></illustration></illusdesc><phystext><texthead justify="left"><l n="but335.1.wc.24.01" justify="left"><physnumber type="pen-and-ink">2</physnumber></l></texthead></phystext></desc><desc id="but335.1.wc.25" dbi="BUT335.1.25.WC"><objtitle><title type="transcribed">A Long Story; Page 3: Beginning of Poem</title>,

The Gothic and cathedral-like space boasts a large stained glass window
               at the bottom of the design.  Conical or triangular spires rise from its ornate frame.  Two carved leaves
               lie on the left side of the window frame; smaller carved leaves decorate the leftmost spire.  Similar
               ornaments seem to appear on either side of the base of the rightmost spire.
               A pointed arch appears on either side of the window.  The points of these arches and the arch over the window
               have tall decorative ornaments as well. They may incorporate carved leaves similar to those that appear
               above the window.
               Two pilasters or pillars are partly visible in the background, rising from above the
               lower arches nearly to the level of the top of the text box.  A pointed arch supported by both pilasters
               spans the distance between the two; part of a second pointed arch extends beyond the right edge of the
               design.  Ribs rise from the top of the rightmost pilaster to the top of the design to create a fan vault.

                  The central panel pictures the hovering, 
                  robed figure of Christ, facing forward with arms down and hands raised slightly from his
                  sides.  Beams of light surround his body.  His feet appear beneath the hem of his gown.
                  The dove of the Holy Ghost hovers above his head.  The bird has wings
                  spread to either side of its body, and emits beams of light as well.  The panels to either side of Christ's panel
                  each display a figure, possibly an angel.  The figure on the left stands facing left and holds its arms out at 45 degrees in front of its body.
                  The figure on the right stands facing right and likewise extends its arms at 45 degrees in front of its body.  Both figures hold
                  a small object, difficult to distinguish, in their outstretched hands.  They wear robes over long gowns.
                  Two angels hover or fly in the panel above Christ's panel.  They face forward and slightly towards each other, so that
                  one faces slightly right and the other slightly left.  They wear long gowns and emit beams of light from their heads.
                  The figure on the left holds a small round object in its left hand.
                  A serpent with an open mouth winds across the panel to the left of the angels' panel; it faces right
                  and its body forms five curves.
                  A dragon with upraised wings and a curved tail faces left in the panel to the right of the angels.  It opens
                  its mouth wide to display jagged teeth. Its back is crested.
                  The other panels in the window are colored but empty of figures.

              The dancing figures include Sir Christopher Hatton, who was Lord-Keeper to Queen Elizabeth
              at the time, and the personified figures of the Great Seal
              and the Mace.  Hatton dances facing right, his body turned slightly forward.  He holds
              a red rose to his nose with elegant posturing.  Hatton is richly dressed in a spiky ruff, a "doublet" (see
              letterpress text) with fur trim, breeches with a ribbon bow visible 
              at the right knee, tights, and high-heeled
              shoes.  He has short, curly hair and a curly beard,
              and is holding a hat with a large plume.  The personified figure of the Great Seal dances beneath the text panel (see "Seals &amp; Maces," Blake's text, Object 22)  His body is the round seal with arms and legs 
              attached.  Two ribbons billow above and to the right of his head, which is wreathed with laurels.  A third ribbon flies to the right from between his legs, becoming
              a devil's forked tail.  The seal itself displays a shield in the center of a circlet of text (see the Textual Transcription).
              His left hand lies in the much larger hand of the dancing Mace, to the right.  The head
              of this figure represents the ornately decorated royal Mace, with eyes, a scrollwork nose,
              and a smiling, partially open mouth added.  The upper part of his head is in the shape of a crown.  The rest of the Mace's body appears human, with
              a torso, arms, hands, legs and feet.  The Mace dances with his right foot
               drawn up and his weight momentarily resting on his left toes.  With the hand of his upraised left
               arm he grasps an enormous staff or mace.  The head of this staff displays a bishop standing
               in a niche.  The Mace wears a wide, spiky collar, a shirt with large buttons down the
               front, breeches with knee ties, stockings, and shoes with ribbon laces tied into bows.
               The wall visible in the background is decorated with a facade of two pillars supporting
               an arch and part of a second arch.  Above each pillar, a different shield or heraldic
               crest appears in each spandrel.  Decorative tracery, vaguely sketched, fills in wall space between crests and
               arches.  The floor is bare, but baseboards appear along the base of the wall and pillar.
               Together these decorative elements suggest a palatial environment.  Each of the three
               dancing figures casts a shadow on the floor below.  Other, less definite shadows appear
               on the wall behind, especially near the arches.

               his right is bent
               and drawn back.  His right foot rests on tiptoe.  His left arm is bent up in front of

               slightly to bring
               his nose near its petals.  His left pinky finger is raised.
               His right arm is drawn back and bent, and his right hand 
               is propped on his right

               Mace, with eyes, a scrollwork nose, and a smiling, partially opened mouth added.  The upper part of his head is in the shape of a crown.  The rest
               of his body appears human, with a torso, arms, hands, legs, and feet.  The Mace dances 
               with his right leg bent and drawn up beneath him, balancing momentarily on the toes of his
               left foot.  His left leg is slightly bent.  His body with its large belly bends left
               slightly.  He raises his slightly bent left arm vertically and grasps an enormous staff or mace
               with his left hand.  The head of this staff displays a bishop, identified by his hat, standing in a niche.
               The Mace extends his bent right arm at 45 degrees to the left and holds the 
               hand of the Great Seal 
               in his own much larger right hand.  The Mace wears a wide, spiky collar, a shirt with 
               large buttons down the front, breeches with knee ties, stockings, and shoes with ribbon laces
               tied into bows.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="structure" location="E"><characteristic>wall</characteristic><characteristic>arch</characteristic><characteristic>crest</characteristic><characteristic>shield</characteristic><characteristic>room</characteristic><characteristic>floor</characteristic><characteristic>pillar</characteristic><characteristic>pilaster</characteristic><characteristic>tracery</characteristic><characteristic>stone</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The wall visible in the background is decorated with two pillars or

The
               body of the young woman on the left faces forward slightly.  Her bent left arm is forward and
               the fingers of her left hand are visible resting in the crook of her companion's right arm.
               Her right arm is also down by her side and bent up and forward.  She raises her right hand slightly
               and gesticulates with her index finger pointed.  The young woman on the right faces to the right, but turns
               her head down and to the left to look at her companion. Her right arm is down by her side but bent
               upward and held forward.  Like her companion she also lifts her right index finger to point upward.  Her slightly bent
               left arm is vertically raised, and she holds a partially open fan above her head.  Both women have
               long, curly hair and wear hats and short-sleeved gowns.
               A building or high wall fills much of the left side of the design and
               supports a leafy vine.  Three stone steps rise leftward from the ground where
               the young women walk.  A stone pillar runs the length of the side of the design from the top step
               to the upper left corner.  Wash along the ground where the young women walk indicates grass.  A grape(?) vine
               with four leaves (or clusters of leaves) and one loop in its tendrils climbs the wall at the left
               side of the design, above the text panel.  Wash above and around the women suggest a cloudy sky,
               perhaps at sunrise or sunset.

               at the poet, who strides leftward at the left side of the design.  Garbed in a long floral gown
               and holding an open book in one hand, the wild-haired poet walks with head bent and arms crossed.
               To the left of his legs three small pigs flee away leftward.  At his feet, a hen with wings spread and mouth open
               herds her six chicks away to the right.  Three geese run rightward with flapping wings.  In front of
               the geese, and partially obscuring them, are two girls who run arm-in-arm to the right.  The leftmost
               girl faces right but turns her head back to the left.  The rightmost girl also runs to the right, but her 
               body is turned slightly forward.  She extends her slightly bent left arm horizontally leftward; it
               supports the right arm of the leftmost girl.  Both girls wear shoes and long gowns with sleeves that
               come to their elbows.  They have long, curly hair.  A small boy just below the text panel also moves away from
               the poet in fear.  Facing forward and to the right, he steps forward with his right leg.  Both
               arms are bent upward at the elbow, and he holds both hands up and open with fingers spread and palms
               facing toward one another.  His spiky hair stands on end, and he wears an expression of fright with
               eyes opened wide, eyebrows raised, and mouth opened.  He is dressed in a shirt and collar and buttons,
               knee breeches with a buttoned flap, stockings, and shoes.  A small cottage or farmhouse with a thatched
               roof appears in the background at the right side of the design, behind the girls clutching arms.  A patch
               of plaster has worn away to the left of the cottage's double window, exposing the brick and mortar beneath.
               A fence in the lower left quadrant of the design partially encloses the yard in which the children and the
               animals take fright at the poet.  The fence consists of rough wooden beams stood on end.  Between the fence
               and the cottage is a small hill or mound.  The poets and children stand or run on a dirt path before the cottage,
               which begins in the lower left corner of the design and leads through a gap between the fence and the cottage
               in the background. Leafy branches of a large tree, its trunk partially visible above the roof of the cottage,
               arch over the top of the design.  Grass covers the ground to the left and right of the path in the lower
               portion of the design.  Wash above the fence and cottage and surrounding the tree's branches suggests the sky,
               perhaps with clouds.  The color of the wash between the fence and cottage hints at a sunrise or sunset.

The poet's "Mother" and "Aunt" (see
               letterpress text), two older women, huddle meekly and fearfully together at the lower left corner of
               the design.  The leftmost of these older ladies sits facing right and slightly forward, her head bowed and
               her eyes lowered or closed.  Her hands are folded together before her face and her mouth is slightly open; she
               may be praying.  Her sister sits next to her, to the right, facing right but turning her torso forward and to 
               the left.  She hides her face and much of her head behind her sister's back, and may be resting her bent head on
               her sister's shoulders.  She embraces her sister with her left arm, which is extended to encircle the other woman's 
               body, hand resting on waist.  Both older women are dressed in long-sleeved gowns and cloaks that drape their shoulders;
               their heads are covered in simple hoods or caps.  The pair of marauding younger sisters strides towards the staircase
               at the right side of the design, caught in the doorway to the stairs
               just as they begin to "rattle" upstairs "in a whirlwind" (see the letterpress text).  They are
               positioned side by side, facing away and slightly right, but each woman turns her head to look leftward over her
               shoulder at the older women.  Each extends her slightly bent right leg behind her, with high-heeled right foot
               on tiptoe.  The rightmost sister brandishes a closed fan in her vertically raised, slightly bent right arm.  The arms
               of the sister on the left are down by her side; her left arm may be bent.  Both women wear long gowns that billow around
               their legs with their brisk motion.  The tails of sashes tied beltlike around their waists flutter like regimental
               standards in their wake.  Both sisters wear large plumed hats and semi-transparent shawls or scarfs that cover their hair beneath.
               The scene takes place inside a lower story room of a cottage or small house, with floors and walls made of wide
               wooden beams.  A mullioned window with muntin bars appears at the left side of the design.  Its frame seems to be
               made of wood, with large round nails in the corners and below the single mullion.  A small round work table sits before
               the older women; on it rest a pair of spectacles, a spool of thread, a piece of cloth, and a pincushion spiky with pins.
               Shadows partly cover the skirts
               of the older women and fall on the floor behind their chairs, beneath the work table, and below the younger sisters.
               A lighter shadow appears on the stairs to the right of the younger women and below and to the right of their feet.
               A small birdcage hangs on a wire, string, or thin chain from the ceiling in the upper left corner of the design.  The bird
               inside sits on a perch and leans its head back, mouth open as if in song.

                  Her head is
                  bowed and her eyes lowered or closed.  Her arms are by her side, bent upward before her torso, and her hands
                  are folded together before her face.  Her mouth is parted slightly, and she may be praying.
                  She is wearing a long-sleeved gown that falls to the floor, hiding
                  her feet.  A cloth or cloak drapes over her shoulders and her head is partly covered with a simple hood
                  or cap that ties under her chin.  The gray hair surrounding her face is pulled back beneath this head
                  covering, and may be short, or long and drawn back.
                  Her sister sits next to her, to the right, facing right but turning her torso forward and to the left.
                  Her legs are bent as well.
                  She hides her face and much of her head behind her sister's back, and may be resting her bent head on her
                  sister's shoulders.  She embraces her sister with her left arm, which is extended to encircle
                  the other woman's body, hand resting on waist.
                   Like her sister, she is dressed in a long-sleeved gown and wears a shawl over her visible
                  shoulder.
                   Her head is similarly covered, with a bit of gray hair peeking from beneath.

               to the right, behind
               them; each wears a slight smile.  Both sisters wear large hats with plumes,
               long gowns with sleeves that reach the elbow, and skirts that sweep behind them.
               Their beltlike sashes billow in the wind they create.  The rightmost sister holds her bent arms before her, 
               below her head, and 
               grasps
               a partially open fan in her left hand.  With her right index finger she makes a pointing gesture.  
               Her sister, partially hidden
               behind her, extends her left arm up and to the right roughly horizontally and bends her right arm up in front of her torso.
               She makes a pointing gesture with both index fingers.  Jagged lightning appears above, below, and behind the sisters.
               Wash around the leftmost sister's hat and to the right of the rightmost sister's hat suggests that the women also may emit light.
               The corner of a table is visible through the open window.  On the table rests a letter of invitation for the poet; this is 
               the "spell upon the table" (see the letterpress text) which the young women leave.  The space inside the window, around the lightning
               and the table, is filled with shadow.  A portion of a second window appears in the lower left corner of the design.
               The wall of the house or cottage in which the windows appear is made of brick and mortar.
               A leafy grape(?) vine climbs the brick wall from the lower right corner to the upper left corner of the design.  The leaves of the plant
               cast shadows on the wall, especially to the left of the text panel and in the bottom right corner of the design.

                  this scarf her hair is long and curly.  Her mouth may be slightly open.
                  Her sister, behind her, extends her left arm up and to the right, roughly horizontally; it
                  is visible below the elbow.  This sister's right arm is bent up in front of her torso.  She makes a pointing
                  gesture with both index fingers.  She wears a small-brimmed hat with two enormous feathered plumes, and a

               the elbows; he holds his forearms up and out in front of him with his hands up, palms out.  He wears a shirt and ruffled ascot or scarf under a long coat with a large collar.  His lower body is clad in breeches
               with buttons at the knee, stockings, and buckled shoes.  His long, curly hair is tied back with a ribbon.  He casts
               a shadow on the floor extending from his feet to the right.  Lady Cobham, the "Peeress" (see the letterpress text), sits facing right and
               slightly forward in a chair on a stone dais or plinth in the upper left corner of the design.  She leans forward and to the right, 
               with her bent legs beneath her skirt drawn
               away from the viewer and 
               her elbows propped on the arms of her chair.  She wears a long gown with voluminous
               skirts that cover her feet, a wide belt, and a large hat with a band and two plumes.  A scarf falls from under her
               hat, drapes her shoulders, and forms a v-shaped neckline over her gown.  Strands of long curly hair escape from
               beneath her hat and scarf.  Her chair has thick, rounded arms; no back is visible.  A footrest draped in fabric
               with a scalloped hem appears beneath her skirts.  Shadows fall across much of the right arm of the chair and part
               of her skirts.  An audience of ten ladies sits shoulder to shoulder, facing right and slightly forward, beneath
               Lady Cobham's dais.  The line they form begins in the lower left corner of the design and slants gently upward to the 
               right, away from the viewer.  All wear long gowns with a variety of necklines; all boast diverse headdresses except
               the three rightmost women, whose heads are hidden by the text box.  Together they form a tribunal headed by Lady Cobham and convened to judge the poet.
               A large stone column or pilaster with Ionic scrolls fills much of the background
               at the right side of the design.  The walls and floor of the room seem to be stone.  Drapery or a curtain descends from the top left corner.  
               Shadows fall between Lady Cobham's skirts and the text box, in the upper right corner
               of the design, and in the lower left corner of the design.

               begins in the lower left corner of the design and slants gently upward to the right, away from the viewer.  With
               Lady Cobham as their head, these women form a tribunal convened to judge the poet.
               The leftmost lady
               sits with her right arm bent, forearm resting along her lap, and her right hand up, palm out.  She looks left
               and wears a long gown with elbow-length sleeves and a wide ruffled collar.  Curls of long hair emerge
               at forehead and neck beneath her large hat.  A long earring dangles from her visible right ear.  Wrinkles on
               her forehead suggest she is older.  Second from left sits a woman wearing a long gown and an architectural bonnet over a headpiece, possibly jeweled, that
               drapes down towards her forehead.  Several curls appear on either side of her bonnet.  The wide triangular
               lapels of her collar are closed at the neck with small buttons or a clasp.  Her arms are not visible.  She turns
               her head slightly forward, so that her face is seen in three-quarters profile, and seems to be smiling.
               
               The woman third from left looks to the right and wears a feathered headdress and
               an Elizabethan ruff in addition to her gown.  A flower pendant with stem and leaves hangs from her v-shaped neckline
               (alternatively, this may be a necklace).  Her arms are not visible.  Her forehead is wrinkled, suggesting age.  
               
               The woman fourth from left sits looking right with lowered eyes; her face is visible in three-quarters profile.
               She wears a long cloak with a pointed hood drawn over her head and clasped at the neck with a knot.  A tighter collar
               appears at her neck inside this hood.  Her hair is short or drawn up under a scarf or other headpiece just visible
               beneath her hood; a jewel or other ornament hangs from this scarf over her hair.  Her arms do not appear.
               
               The woman fifth from left sits with her arms bent at the elbows and her forearms held out in front of her; her hands
               are up with vertical palms facing out.  She turns her head to look left at her neighbor and her face is visible in three-quarters profile.
               Her mouth is open.
               She wears a long gown with long cuffed sleeves and a wide, tall collar.  Her hair is either short, or long and swept up
               into her pointed hat.  An earring adorns her visible left ear.
               
               The woman sixth from left sits looking right, with her head bent down and lips curved in a slight smile.  
               Her left forearm rests along her lap and
               she holds her left hand up, palm out.  She wears a short-sleeved gown with a wide belt and a high bonnet with a ruffled
               brim.  Two curly strands of hair, or perhaps ribbon, appear over her left shoulder.  
               
               The woman seventh from left turns her
               upper body forward and to the left to look at the woman in a bonnet.  Her left arm rests along her lap and she lifts
               her left fingers slightly.  A wide, decorated collar surmounts her long gown and she wears a bonnet or other 
               headdress on her head.  Her gown is the only one with a decorative hem. 
               Wrinkles on her forehead suggest that she is an older woman.  
               Three other women complete the row, but their heads are hidden behind the text box and their arms do not appear.
               A ruff adorns the costume of the leftmost of these women; a circular collar appears on the gown of the middle woman, and
               a v-shaped collar tops the gown of the woman at the right.
               Their long gowns hide all the women's feet.
               One chair is partially visible, the support of the leftmost woman.  Its back and rear right leg appear beneath and 
               to the left of her skirts.
               Shadow covers much of the chair and also falls across this woman's skirts.

               His upper body is turned slightly left.  With his weight on his right foot, he bends his left leg and
               extends it backwards, his left foot on tiptoe.  His arms are by his side and bent at the elbow, with
               forearms horizontal and hands raised with palms out and fingers spread.  He wears a long coat with a large
               collar, knee breeches, stockings, and shoes.  His long curly hair is tied back.  The Peeress, Lady Cobham,
               appears facing right just to the right of the text panel as she descends the stairs from her dais.  The
               toes of her daintily-heeled left foot just touch the floor, while the shape of her skirts suggests that
               her right leg is bent, though her right foot is hidden.  Smiling gently, she bends her head graciously and
               turns it slightly forward, towards the poet.  Her arms are by her side but bent at the elbow, and she holds
               her lower arms raised at about 45 degrees before her.  Her hands fall from her wrists with palms facing out.
               She wears a large, wide-brimmed hat with two plumes; a transparent scarf falls from beneath this hat and drapes
               over her shoulders.  Her long curly hair appears beneath this scarf, and strands escape from it to frame her
               face.  She wears a long gown, or shirt and skirt, with a wide belt at the waist.  The sleeves of her top end
               at her elbows and may be decorated with a button or other ornament at the cuffs.  Four of the ladies who
               form the tribunal convened under Lady Cobham to judge the poet are visible sitting side by side near the lower
               left corner of the design.
               All four women sit facing right and slightly forward.
               Lady Cobham's chair sits on a stone dais or plinth in the upper left corner of the design.  Only one of its curved
               arms is visible.  Several steps leading down from the dais in the upper left corner appear beneath the text
               panel.  The steps, the walls, and the floor of the room seem made of stone.  A stone column or pilaster is visible above the text panel.  Shadows fall on the chair and the wall in the upper left corner of
               the design, on the floor and on the skirts of the leftmost lady in the lower left corner of the design, and
               on the wall to the left and right of Lady Cobham.  Lighter shadows mark the wall in the upper right corner.

               turns her head to the left to look at her neighbor.  Her mouth is open and her eyebrow creased in an expression
               of surprise or concern.  This rightmost woman wears a long gown that hides her feet and a large
               bonnet over a wimple.  Her bent left arm is down by her side; her lower arm may rest partially on her lap.  
               Her wrinkled visage suggests her age.  A few curly strands of hair may be visible over her forehead; alternatively
               this may be a fringe on her wimple.
               
               The face of the younger woman second to right is visible in three-quarters profile.  
               She tilts her head back and lifts her eyes, her mouth open
               as if in prayer. She holds her folded hands before her, palms together; her arms are bent.  She wears
               a long-sleeved gown, shoes with pointed toes, and a large headpiece that boasts draped fabric and two
               cross ornaments.
               
               The woman second from left turns her head to the right, her mouth open and her eyebrows raised.
               Her arms are bent and she clasps her hands in front of her torso.
               She wears a large bonnet or mob cap and a long-sleeved gown with a large collar that is fastened
               at the neck with a button or other ornament.  Her pointed shoes are visible beneath the hem of her gown.
               Her wrinkled neck and face suggests that she is older.
               
               The leftmost woman is only partially visible; her face, turned to the left, and the right side of her body extend outside the

               holds her clasped hands in front of her torso.  She wears a gown with long sleeves and
               cuffs and a large collar, and a pointed hat.  A strand of curly hair or ribbon may appear over her left shoulder.

His dress
               seems Grecian or Roman, including a crown of laurels over his short curly hair and a long gown.  One bare foot, his left,
               appears beneath the hem of this gown.  His left arm is by his side, bent at the elbow with forearm horizontal;
               he holds a manuscript in the form of an open book or stack of papers in his left hand.  He extends his right arm forward,
               bent slightly up, and holds his right hand up with vertical palm facing out.  Shadows fall down the back
               of his gown.  His audience consists of three representatives of upper class society, seated at a card table near
               the lower left corner of the design; their reactions range from surprise to boredom.  One of these, a well-dressed man,
               sits facing forward and to the right behind the table, to the left of the text panel.  He looks at the poet with 
               surprise, his eyebrows raised and his mouth open. His right arm is bent and his right elbow may rest on the table;
               both forearms are raised and his hands are lifted with palms facing out.  The man wears an enormous neck scarf, ruffled
               ascot, possibly a vest, and coat with a large collar.  His hair is short and curly.  His lower body is hidden behind the table.
               To the left of this man sits a woman positioned at the end of the table farthest from the poet, near the left
               edge of the design.  She faces right but may be looking at the man seated at the table rather than at the poet.  
               Her right forearm is visible,
               raised horizontally above the table, with cards held in her right hand.  Under her hat, her hair is curly and short,
               or drawn back.  Shadows fall below her right arm.  Her lower body is hidden.  
               The third figure at the table, a woman, sits in front of the table and faces away and to the right.  She leans back in 
               her chair and bends her head down slightly.  Her head is turned to the right so that her face is visible in profile, and
               her mouth shape suggests she may be smiling slightly as she looks toward the table.  Her bent right arm is raised and
               extended roughly horizontally; she rests her forearm on the table and holds six cards in her upraised right hand.  She
               wears a long gown with voluminous skirts that hides her feet, though its shape reveals that her right leg is bent.
               A scarf drapes her shoulders.  Her long hair is gathered into a snood behind her head, while shorter curls frame her face.
               She seems to be ignoring the poet completely.  The backrest of her chair faces the viewer, and only its rear legs are
               visible under her skirts.  The chair casts shadows on the back of her dress.
               Shadows fall diagonally across the top of the design from top right to lower left edge, and fill the space under
               the table and to the right of the poet.

               forward.  His arms are down but bent upward at the elbows and crossed over his chest.  His left hand seems
               to be hidden inside his clothing, but his right hand makes a loose fist.  He tilts his head back slightly
               and raises his eyes to look upward.  His mouth is open slightly.  He has short curly hair and a similar
               beard.  He wears a long gown or robe that falls past his feet and puddles slightly on the ground; it seems
               to be semi-transparent as his left knee and foot are visible through it, positioned slightly forward.
               Two children huddle close on either side of the man, who may be their father.  The child on the left faces
               right and slightly forward.  Long hair suggests that this child may be a girl.  She wears a long cloak that
               covers her upraised arms and hands as she buries her face in its folds.  This garment hides the rest of her body,
               including her feet.  The child on the right, who seems to be a boy, faces left and slightly away; he is seen
               partially from behind.  He lowers his head and wraps his slightly bent left arm, raised at 45 degrees, around
               his father's knee.  His left leg is bent and his bare left foot is on tiptoe; his right arm and leg are not
               visible.  He is wearing tights with a belt or well-defined waist and a wide collar seen from behind.  His hair
               is short and curly.  The man's clothing partially drapes over the back of the boy at his side.
               A tombstone juts out of the ground at an angle in the lower left corner of the design.  Scrolling lines
               at the top of the tombstone suggest decorations or perhaps inscriptions.  The stone is otherwise blank of writing, though a shadow
               cuts across it diagonally.  The ground on which the tombstone and the grieving family stands is covered
               with grass.  Its hilly little mounds suggest a graveyard.  Wash at the top of the design and to the left
               of the text box suggests the sky, perhaps with clouds interspersed near the top of the design and gathered
               more thickly to the left of the text box.  Shadow fills the design to the left of the tombstone, between the
               stone and the grieving family, and between the family and the right edge of the design.

               spreading roots of the largest stump below ground.  The largest stump, belonging to what was once an enormous
               tree, appears to the right of the text panel.  Its roots fan out below: one large root branch stretches
               to the left and sends two large tendrils downward before it curves down itself and ends near the left edge
               of the design; another large root branch extends down below the stump and splits into several smaller offshoots.
               Two more stumps appear to the left of the text box, on the same level as the largest stump.  The larger of these
               two stumps, on the right, sends out roots that seem to extend above ground to the left and right, above the
               roots of the largest tree. 
               The personified figure of Grief (see the Textual Transcription) appears as a gowned, seated woman curled within the
               underground embrace of several additional roots near, but not clearly connected to the roots of the largest
               tree stump.  Grief sits facing forward and to the right, with her legs bent away from the viewer.  Twisting
               her torso forward and lowering her left shoulder, she cradles an infant in the crook of her left arm with
               her left elbow and forearm resting along her lap.  Her right arm is by her side and bent, forearm horizontal,
               and she holds her left breast between her right index and middle fingers as if guiding it towards the child
               in her other arm.  The tiny nude infant, which seems to have sparse, short, curly hair, lies face up with 
               its head back and its left arm dangling over Grief's arm.  This limp posture and its facial expression, with
               eyes closed and mouth open, suggests that it is dead.  But Grief bends over it carefully, lowering her head
               to gaze fixedly at the child's face.  Her long wild hair falls over her shoulders and merges with the roots that
               encircle woman and child.  Shadows below Grief and to the right suggest the darkness of an underground cave-like
               hollow.  Wash surrounding the roots below ground suggest dirt.  Above ground, the handle of an ax is
               propped against the stump of the largest tree.  Its blade rests facing downward to the left of
               the text box, against the roots of the first and second largest stumps.  The text box hides a large section of the
               ax's handle. Wash in the upper half of the design suggests the sky, perhaps streaked with clouds.

Adversity
               sits facing forward on a low bench, positioned below and to the left of the text box.  Her knees are bent and her
               legs are crossed, right leg behind left leg.  She holds her arms extended out before her, slightly bent; her
               right forearm rests on her right knee, while her left inner elbow is propped over her left knee.  In her right 
               hand she holds a compass or dividers.
               Her right index finger extends in a pointing gesture along one side of this instrument, the ends of which
               may rest on the ground.  A large tome representing the Book of the Law stands on its end near her foot; she
               holds the other end with her left hand.  Adversity wears a turban, or a scarf wrapped turban-like around her head, and a
               long-sleeved gown with voluminous folds that drape her knees, cover her legs, and fall to the floor below her.
               Her bare left foot, on tiptoe, emerges from beneath these folds.  Her long white hair falls from beneath her
               turban and cascades over her right shoulder; her left shoulder is hidden behind the text box.  Her wrinkled
               face and neck indicate her age, while her drawn expression, creased eyebrows, and straightforward gaze suggest
               an attitude of austere pity.
               The personification of Virtue appears as a nude young female (see the letterpress text) sitting on Adversity's shadowed lap.  Virtue sits
               with her legs bent and drawn up together underneath her, resting a large closed book on her lap.  Her legs
               face right and slightly forward, and she twists her torso further forward.  The book she supports may be meant
               to represent the Book of Experience.  Virtue's left arm is bent and lies extended along her lap, underneath
               the book; the fingers of her left hand hold the far end of the tome.  Her right arm is by her side and bent,
               with forearm raised horizontally and right hand lying on the book.  She holds a pen or similar instrument in
               this hand and seems to be writing on the cover of the book: she may be inscribing its title.  She lowers her
               head and looks intently at her work.  Her hair is drawn up into a bun behind her head.  Her breasts are
               visible, but not prominent.  A wall, perhaps made of stone, extends the length of the right side of the
               design.  The ground on which Adversity's bench rests also seems to be made of stone.  Wash filling the area
               above and to the left of Adversity suggests the sky, perhaps with clouds.  Light shadow falls on the wall in the
               lower right corner of the design.

Facing forward she
               crouches with both her hands raised.  She leans slightly to the right.  Her bent left arm is raised over
               her head; her right arm is raised at 135 degrees.  Both hands grasp a scarf or long cloth with flame-like ends that extends
               over her head and falls in folds on either side of the design.  Or is this object dark and smoky fire?  Adversity's left leg is bent and drawn up
               in front of her body; her right leg, mostly hidden behind other figures in the foreground,
               extends left.  Her mouth is open and her eyes are wide and staring beneath unkempt white eyebrows.  These and
               the wrinkles visible on her face and neck suggest her age.  Instead of hair, snakes writhe in twists and coils
               in all directions from the top of her head.  Adversity wears a garment, perhaps a gown, with long sleeves and
               a wide neckline open to reveal her bony ribcage.  Folds of her clothing cover much of her body and form a whirlwind
               shape surrounding the personified figure of Despair in the lower left corner of the design.  Despair (see the letterpress text) appears as a 
               dark-skinned demon below and to the left of the text box, facing forward.  The figure seems to be male.  He raises
               both arms vertically overhead, and grasps a short, sharp, deadly-looking dagger in each fist.  Notably, these daggers
               point inward, as if poised for self-harm.  His teeth are bared in a grimace and he draws his eyebrows together
               menacingly.  His nude upper torso, which is all that is visible of his body below the shoulders, emerges from
               the whirlpool-like spiral of cloth from Adversity's garments.  The personified figure of Disease (see the letterpress text)
               as an old woman hovers or flies in the foreground, near the bottom of the design.  Her body seems to extend away
               from the viewer but she bends her head back to look forward.  She wears a long-sleeved gown that hides her lower
               body completely and stretches to the left beyond the border of the design.  Both arms are extended straight down
               and to the left from her shoulders.  She supports the body of an upside-down pitcher with her left hand and
               holds its neck loosely with the fingers of her right hand.  Her right wrist may rest on the pitcher.  Yellowish
               liquid pours from the pitcher's open mouth and streams leftward.  A wimple covers her head and drapes down over her
               shoulders before joining the streaming folds of her other garments.  Her face, with its wrinkles, drooping eyelids, and
               down-turned mouth, suggests her age.
               A thin old man personifies Poverty (see the letterpress text), visible in the lower right corner of the design.  He faces forward, with his
               body extended away from the viewer and slightly down.  His slightly bent arms are raised vertically overhead.  He
               grasps a scourge in each upraised fist.  His right leg stretches down and to the left, while his bent left leg seems
               to be drawn up slightly behind and beneath him.  The top of his left foot is visible on tiptoe; this foot may rest on the
               ground or hover in the air.  Poverty himself may hover or fly, or may be crouching on the ground.  He is bald and nude
               from the torso up; his waist and lower limbs are wrapped pant-like in cloth.  His mouth is open.  His wrinkled face
               indicates that he old.  Dark shadows fill the design around Adversity and her band.

               figures in the foreground, extends left; her bare right foot is visible on tiptoe near the lower left corner of the design.
               Her mouth is open, showing upper and lower teeth and her tongue.  
               Her eyes are wide and staring beneath unkempt white eyebrows.  These and the wrinkles visible on her face and neck
               suggest her age.  Instead of hair,
               snakes writhe in twists and coils in all directions from the top of her head.  In particular, one snake tail forms
               a spiral to the right of Adversity's chin.
               Six of them have visible heads; five of these hold their mouths
               open, with extended tongues.  
               Adversity wears a garment, perhaps a gown, with long sleeves and a wide neckline open to reveal her bony ribcage.  Folds

                  dagger in each fist.  Notably, these daggers point inward, as if poised for self-harm.
                  His teeth are bared in a grimace and he draws his eyebrows together menacingly.

               lowered, with visible left brow creased.  A cloak, blanket, or other cloth covers his head and drapes over his shoulders.
               He is wrapped in a sheet reminiscent of a shroud that covers his body completely, even his arms and feet.  Shapes
               beneath this sheet suggest that his straight legs are extended together, and at least his left arm is by his side,
               bent upward at the elbow, with his left hand held before his chest.  His short, curly hair emerges from beneath
               his hood.  The bed on which the man reclines extends from one side of the design to the other.  This bed may
               be covered with a sheet.  A pillow or headboard appears at the right side of the design.
               Adversity here appears in "form benign" (see the letterpress text).  Her upper body hovers near the middle of
               the design, just to the left of the text box; her lower body is not visible.  Her head is bent down slightly and

               right and down slightly and she rests the tips of the fingers of her left hand behind the man's head.  She holds her
               right arm out to the left, bent upward at the elbow, with her hand raised and her right index finger pointing upward.
               She wears a wimple under a cloak or cloth that covers her head and drapes over her right arm.  The folds of this
               cloak join the folds of her wimple and the habit or gown she wears.  A sleeve covers her left arm to the wrist.
               Darkness fills much of the design, surrounding the figures.  Dark clouds help to buoy Adversity, appearing between
               her upper body and the reclining body of the man below.  Wash suggests additional clouds to the upper right of the

He faces right
               but turns his torso slightly forward.  He sits with his shoulders hunched and his head bent down; he props his
               left elbow forward on his lap or the left arm of his chair with his left forearm bent upward and his left hand
               raised.  His extended left index finger lies along his forehead, while the other fingers of his left hand curl inward.
               A large book lies open on his lap.  He is wrapped in a cloak or cloth that drapes his shoulders and envelops his
               body.  His right foot, clad in a shoe, emerges from beneath its fabric.  His eyes are lowered to look at the book
               as though reading.  His hair, through short, curls in an unruly fashion over his forehead, the tip of his visible
               right ear, and the nape of his neck.  A Corinthian pillar rises on the left side of the text box, behind the poet.
               Its capital appears just to the left of the upper left corner of the text box.  Ribs rise from the
               capital and arch towards the top and upper left corner of the design to create a fan vault.  The rightmost of these ribs forms an arch
               over the top of the room's large Gothic window.  The wall that fills the rest of the design seems to be made
               of stone, as is the floor.  Shadows fall on the wall or floor behind the poet's chair, and on the wall beneath
               the window and near the left side of the design.  A stained glass window fills much of the design around
               and to the right of the text box. Two muntin bars separate the window into three visible panes, each with Gothic
               tracery at the top.  The design of the middle pane displays an angel or cherub, which may be male, hovering near the top 
               of the window with its vertical body facing forward.  
               It has at least
               three pairs of wings spread on either side of its body.  
               The cherub's left arm is down by its side.  Its right arm is bent at the elbow, with forearm across
               its torso; in this hand it supports a butterfly, or perhaps a double flame.  Its legs are difficult to distinguish,
               but may extend downward together.  Beams of flame-like light surround the cherub in the design and extend downward towards
               the figure of a Muse who is created to look as if she sits on the sill, facing forward with her legs folded beneath
               her.  She tilts her head up and back as if she is looking at the cherub above.  Her bent right arm is held forward
               before her torso, and she holds a quill pen in this raised hand as if poised to write.  A scroll lies unfolded
               across her lap.  She has short, curly hair and wears a long-sleeved gown with skirts that spread over her lower
               body and fall to the ground on the right.  A separate cloak seems to drape her shoulders and fall in folds
               past her waist; it reaches the ground on the left.

               right of the text box.  Two muntin bars separate the window into three visible panes, each
               with Gothic tracery at the top.  The design of the middle pane displays an angel or cherub, which may be male,
               hovering near the top of the window with its vertical body facing forward.  
               It has at least three pairs of wings spread on either side of its body.
               The cherub's left arm is down by its side.  
               Its right arm is bent at the elbow, with forearm across its torso; in this hand it supports a butterfly, or 
               perhaps a double flame.  Its legs are difficult to distinguish, but may extend downward together.  Beams of light
               surround the cherub in the design and extend downward towards the figure of a Muse who is created to look as if she
               sits on the sill, facing forward with her legs folded beneath her.  She tilts her head up and back as if
               she is looking at the cherub above.  Her bent right arm is held forward before her torso, and she holds a
               quill pen in this raised hand as if poised to write.  A scroll lies unfolded across her lap.  She has short, curly
               hair and wears a long-sleeved gown with skirts that spread over her lower body and fall to the ground to the right.
               A separate cloak seems to drape her shoulders and fall in folds past her waist; it reaches the ground on the left.

               A Grecian woman, who represents the "rich stream of music" in the form of both poetry and also the Helicon (see the letterpress text),

Fairies
               appear in many of the blooms, representing the spirits of "The laughing flowers" that "Drink life and fragrance"
               from the Helicon (see the letterpress text).  The rightmost plant on the cliff is a lily with many curving leaves and
               a large forward-facing blossom near
               the ground.  A
               fairy sits within its petals, facing forward but turning her head to look to the left and stretching her right arm
               horizontally to the left.  She wears a hat and a gown with skirts that hide her legs.  To the right, another fairy
               stands facing right and bending forward, head bent back.  This fairy, perhaps female, wears a gown
               that merges with the lily's graceful leaves.  She holds her right arm down but bent up at the elbow, and may rest
               her right hand on her neck or chest.  She bends over another fairy seated to the right, who bends her head up to
               look at her companion above.  This fairy may have long hair.
               To the left of the forward-facing blossom, another fairy stands facing forward and to the left within a 
               blossom that faces up; its petals and her skirts
               are one.  She raises both arms vertically overhead in a gesture that suggests stamen.  A vial, urn, vase,or hat on her head suggests petals.  Her hands seem to rest on either side of the objct.
               A third lily blossom depends leftward from a stem that curves over the standing fairy.  A fairy emerges from
               the blossom like stamen, facing down and to the left with head bent back and arms stretched vertically down.
               She wears a gown that merges with the flower, though at least her left leg is visibly bent back to rest
               on the lily's highest petal.  She may be wearing a hat, or may have her hair in a bun.
               Far to the left is another flowering plant.  Two flowers appear above the cliff; a third flower, hangs from a stem that curves to left and down past the top of the cliff.  The upper body of
               a fairy emerges upside down from between the petals
               of this third blossom, bending to the right to look down to the right.  She seems to be female with her hair
               drawn back into a bun or similar coiffure behind her head.  Her right arm is down and bent.
               Leaves grow above the text panel between the leftmost flower and the lily on the right.
               A third flower grows from the side of the stream near the upper left corner of the text panel.  Its leaves grow
               up and to the left.  A long stem with several more leaves depends from the left side of the plant before curling
               up again in a spiral that forms one loop.  A flower, perhaps honeysuckle, blooms facing up to the right.  
               A fairy emerges from between its petals, facing
               forward and to the right.  She bends gracefully backwards and twists her head partly to the left; she may be
               looking up to the upside down fairy in the blossom above.  Her left arm is extended out to the right and she holds
               an object, perhaps a vase, bowl, or pot, in her left hand.  Her right arm is down and bent across her torso; her right hand
               holds a corner of the scroll.  She wears a long gown and her hair seems to be drawn back into a bun.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="vegetation" location="CD"><characteristic>blossom</characteristic><characteristic>flower</characteristic><characteristic>leaf</characteristic><characteristic>lily</characteristic><characteristic>petal</characteristic><characteristic>plant</characteristic><characteristic>stamen</characteristic><characteristic>arching</characteristic><characteristic>loop</characteristic><characteristic>spiral</characteristic><characteristic>fairy</characteristic><characteristic>spirit</characteristic><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>chalice</characteristic><characteristic>goblet</characteristic><characteristic>pitcher</characteristic><characteristic>vase</characteristic><characteristic>bowl</characteristic><characteristic>bending forward</characteristic><characteristic>bending right</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>leaning</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>reaching</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>facing away</characteristic><characteristic>seen from behind</characteristic><characteristic>facing down</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing up</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>twisted</characteristic><characteristic>upside down</characteristic><characteristic>vegetating</characteristic><characteristic>stretched</characteristic><characteristic>head bent back</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>arm down</characteristic><characteristic>arm extended</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised at 135 degrees</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised horizontally</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised vertically</characteristic><characteristic>hand raised</characteristic><characteristic>hand resting</characteristic><characteristic>palm up</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent</characteristic><characteristic>leg extended</characteristic><characteristic>leg extended backward</characteristic><characteristic>tiptoe</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>belt</characteristic><characteristic>hat</characteristic><characteristic>wreath</characteristic><characteristic>jewelry</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>upper body</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>group of figures</characteristic><illusobjdesc>More vegetation grows on either side of the banks of the Helicon on the flat ground at the bottom
               of the design.  Fairies appear within these blooms as well.  On the far bank, at the left side of the design, two
               blooms appear next to the water.  The head and shoulders of a fairy emerge from each bloom.  The shoulders of 
               the fairy on the right face forward and to the right, though she turns her head slightly left.  Only part of her upper
               right arm is visible above the petals.  Her left arm is raised at 135 degrees and she lifts a bowl or cup up with her
               left hand.  She has long hair.  The fairy on the left faces forward and to the right, with long hair falling over
               her shoulders.  Her slightly bent right arm is down, resting on the petals of her flower.  She extends her slightly
               bent left arm to the right and dips a bowl or cup into the waters of the stream with her left hand.  Above
               these two fairies a cluster of leaves grows upward.  The upper body of a fairy emerges from the leaves, facing away and 
               slightly right, leaning away and reaching his or her right arm horizontally to the right.  He or she, who may
               be nude, holds a pitcher out towards or into the waterfall to the right.  This fairy may be male, and/or may
               wear a hat.
               On the near side of the bank, just below the waterfall, two fairies face left and 
               bend forward over the water.  The leftmost fairy
               stands within the petals of a flower on the bank, bending forward and stretching her left arm down to the left.  She holds a pitcher
               over the water with her left hand.  She turns her head forward.  She wears a gown with a belt or a gathered waistline.
               She wears a hat of petals.  Above her and slightly to the right, the second fairy faces left and bends forward, her
               head bent back.  The rest of her body is hidden behind the first fairy.  Her hair is drawn back into a bun.
               To the right of them a fairy emerges from a cluster of petals and leaves, as if she is another petal.
               Her lower body faces left but at the waist she twists away and to the right.  Her left leg is extended backwards, her
               left foot on tiptoe.  Her slightly bent right arm is raised at 135 degrees and she holds a goblet up with her
               right hand.  Her head is bent back and her long hair streams leftward over her shoulder.  She wears a long gown
               with a belt or a well-defined waist.  To the left another fairy faces forward and to the left, supported by several
               leaves.  She raises her right arm nearly vertically.  With her right hand she holds a goblet next to the upraised
               goblet of the fairy to the left.  This pair may be toasting each other.  Her long, curly hair streams past her left shoulder and along her left arm, raised
               horizontally with palm up.  She wears a gown and a wreath of flowers or jewels on her head.  Her slightly bent legs curve
               behind her to the right, along the leaves.
               Just to the left of the Grecian woman's gown, two stems with three leaves grow up and curl down to the left.  A
               blossom appears at the end of each stem.  The upper body of a fairy appears
               within the blossom on the left, stretching down to the right and reaching her right arm vertically overhead to the right.
               She is
               seen from behind, but bends her head back so that her face is seen from above.  She may be wearing a gown and
               a hat, perhaps with petals.
               Another fairy's upper body emerges from the blossom on the right, upside down with her torso facing away and her head bent back
               to look down.  She seems to be wearing a gown and has her hair drawn back in a bun.  Her arms are stretched down
               past her head.  Her right arm is bent around a vase or similar vessel and her right hand supports its base.
               Her left arm is also bent and she rests her left hand on the side of the vase.
               Below this fairy, another fairy's upper body faces away and raises her slightly bent arms vertically overhead.  Her hands rest
               on the vase above as well.  She bends her
               head back sharply to look at the fairy above.  Her hair is short or drawn back, and she wears a garment that merges
               with the petals of a flower below.  two lilies rise on curving stems near the lower right margin of the design.

               his seat and his lower left leg crossed in front of the right.  He leans right and props his left elbow on
               a short pillar.  A curling ram's horn decorates the capital of this pillar, which also boasts a decorative
               border of scrolling vegetation, including vines and leaves.
               Jove's lower left arm is bent up and his left hand is raised.  He holds his head turned slightly

               knuckles of this hand.  His mouth is open.  His right forearm appears extended vertically to the left and he
               grasps the enormous head of a large scepter with his right hand.  Carved oak leaves and acorns adorn the head
               of this scepter.
               Jove has a curly beard and long curly hair.
               He wears a long gown or robe; the robe's thick folds of rich fabric drape his shoulders and fall past his right
               knee.  An ornate border of small figures hems the bottom of his robe.  His left foot, clad in a sandal, emerges from beneath this border.  Light surrounds or perhaps
               emanates from Jove's head in the upper right corner of the design.  The effect suggests a halo.
               A large eagle hunches with claws resting on Jove's extended
               right arm.  The bird perches facing forward and slightly right, with wings half-folded and powerful head
               and beak lowered.
               The floor below Jove and the wall behind him seem to be made of stone.  Jove casts a shadow on the floor
               to the right of his foot.  Shadow fills the space to the left of Jove's scepter and to the right of his left
               elbow, and darkens the wall above
               the eagle.

               A winged boy or cherub hovers beneath the text box, facing forward but twisting to the right
               in a slightly contrapposto pose.  His left leg may be slightly bent, but is extended downward with his foot on
               tiptoe.  His right leg is bent and crossed behind his left; his right foot is also on tiptoe and is visible just to
               the right of the left leg.  A violin is propped beneath the boy's chin.  The fingers of his left hand rest on the
               neck of the violin as he plays.  His right arm is by his side and bent up across his torso; he holds a bow across the violin's strings
               with his right hand.  His head is bent and turned to the right, so that his cheek helps to hold the violin in place.
               His wings are spread on either side of his body.  He is nude with visible genitals, and he has short, curly hair.
               Five female figures appear in a line, facing away, hovering above the ground to the right of
               the text box.  
               The nearest figure, which is also the leftmost
               figure, dances with her right leg forward and her left leg bent backwards.  Her legs are crossed below the knees
               and her feet are on tiptoe.  Her slightly bent right arm is raised nearly vertically; she holds a tambourine
               in her upraised right hand.  Her body is twisted into a slight, graceful contrapposto.  She wears a semi-transparent
               gown that leaves her right arm and shoulder bare and swirls around her ankles.  Her hair is drawn back into a bun.
               The text panel hides her left arm and shoulder.
               The next four figures are staggered to the right, so that only the right half of each dancer's body is visible.
               The position of each echoes the first, with right arm raised and upraised hand holding a tambourine.  Each
               wears a gown.  None has visible feet.
               Four more dancing figures, the mirror opposite of those facing away, hover and proceed forward in a line at the left of the
               text box.  The nearest figure is also the rightmost figure.  Her right leg is forward and her left leg is bent.  Her
               legs are crossed below the knees and her feet are on tiptoe.  She bends to the right slightly, her body in a gentle
               contrapposto position.  Her slightly bent right arm is raised vertically overhead, and she holds a tambourine aloft.
               Her head is turned slightly to the left and bent back, and she smiles with a slightly open mouth that reveals her teeth.
               Her eyes are raised.  Her hair is short and curly.  Her long, transparent gown swirls
               around her legs. It is cut to leave her right arm and breast bare.  A high slit over her thigh exposes her bare right
               leg.  A button or similar ornament appears above the slit.  The three dancers behind her are staggered so that only
               their right sides are visible.  Their positions mimic the leaders': each raises her right arm and holds a tambourine
               over her head. Their heads and lower bodies are mostly hidden, though the swirling skirts of the leftmost dancer appear
               just to the right of the left edge of the design.
               A young woman stands or walks at the left side of the design, facing forward and to the left.
               She steps forward with her left leg; her right foot is visible extended behind her on tiptoe.  Her
               right arm is held out from her body slightly and bent at the elbow.  Her left arm is down but bent up at the elbow.
               Both hands support a flute.  She bends her head slightly to bring her lips near the flute.  Her curly hair is drawn up
               into a bun and a braid wraps her head.  She wears a long gown with a belt or well-defined waistline.
               A similar young woman stands at the right side of the design, facing forward and to the right.  In a mirror of the
               woman at the other side, she steps forward with her right leg; her left foot appears on tiptoe extended behind her.
               Her arms are by her side and bent up at the elbow.  Her hands support a flute in front of her torso.  Her head
               is bent.  Her short curly hair is drawn into a bun; a ribbon or band wraps her hair.  Her long, semi-transparent dress
               swirls around her legs.
               The ground at the bottom of the design is covered with grass.  A tree grows up the right side
               of the design.  Near the top right corner of the design, this tree sends a limb arching leftward towards the
               middle.  It breaks into smaller branches that support sparse leaves.  Several more limbs arch from the left
               side of the design into the middle, bearing similar sparse leaves.
               A six pointed star glimmers between the branches at the top of the design.  Wash around the
               figures below hints at a nighttime sky.

                  of the text panel and below his outstretched right arm.  The cloak may pass over his right shin, though
                  it is transparent here.  A button, brooch, or similar ornament appears in the folds of the cloak just to the right
                  of the text panel.  Hyperion has short golden curls.  He and his chariot are superimposed over, or may be one with, 
                  a blazing sun; sharp beams of light burst in all directions from Hyperion himself and along the
                  edges of the sun's globe.  These rays are also spears, the "shafts
                  of war" mentioned in the text.

                  bottom of the design, fleeing from Hyperion's sunburst above.  They are mostly disembodied heads.
               The one nearest the lower left corner faces up and to the right, though it is tilted slightly forward so
               as to be visible in three-quarters profile.  This head, with eyes raised and mouth open, is wrapped in
               a cloak or similar cloth that extends up to the right.  Its tongue is visible.  Above this head a second head with open mouth
               and raised eyes looks forward and to the right, tilted back to face up slightly.  Its teeth and tongue
               are visible in its open mouth.  Hair or folds of fabric
               are indistinctly visible to the left and right of this head.  A third head, in between and to the right
               of the first two, appears in profile facing down and slightly left.  Its mouth is open.  The hair of its
               long beard streams past its cheeks and up to the right.  This head may also have hair on the top of
               its head.  Below this third head, fainter lines suggest the staring eyes and open nasal socket of an upside down skull,
               facing forward and up.  To the right of the third head, another clearly outlined head appears upside down
               and facing up and to the right.  This head has wide eyes and open mouth under a mop of wavy hair.
               A cloak or similar cloth circles its neck and surrounds its hair.  Its shoulders may be just visible beneath
               the nearest rays of the sun.
               Below and to the right of this upside down head appears another upside down head, facing away so that its long hair
               faces the viewer.  In the lower right corner, two more upside down heads appear side by side.  The leftmost
               of these two seems to have wavy hair, and 
               faces forward and slightly right.  Its bald partner is seen in profile, facing up.  Both have
               open mouths.  Just below them, as if partly hidden behind them,
               the eyes and nose of yet another upside down face look forward.
               Finally, above this grouping of three,
               one eye and a curved line suggesting the bald pate of another upside down head appear between
               beams of light.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="object" location="E"><characteristic>darkness</characteristic><characteristic>night</characteristic><characteristic>shadow</characteristic><characteristic>dark</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Dark shadows fill the edges of the design between the beams of light, and particularly

               She wears a long-sleeved gown under a cloak or robe that drapes from her right shoulder over her right side and knee.
               The folds of these garments envelop her lower body and puddle on the ground beneath her, but underneath the fabric
               her legs seem to be bent with knees drawn slightly up.  Her legs may be crossed at the ankles.  She extends her
               slightly bent left arm horizontally right and points at Vice, who sits on the ground to the right.  The queen's right arm
               is bent and held in front of her torso, with her elbow perhaps propped on her right knee.  She holds the head of a 
               scepter loosely with her right hand.  Long curly locks of hair fall over her shoulders, and she wears a crown on her head.
               Vice sits facing right and slightly forward, turning his head up and to the left to look at the tyrant.  His eyes are 
               raised, and his mouth is open and may be smiling.  Vice's legs are bent with his knees splayed apart.  His right
               arm is down by his side but bent across his torso; he plays a harmonium (or small organ) with the fingers of his right 
               hand.  His left forearm is bent upward and he holds his left index finger in his left ear as if to block out the noise
               of his own playing.  Both of his ears are the ears of an ass, and his visible right foot is a hoof, though Vice is
               otherwise human in form.  A wreath of laurels rests on his head over his short curly hair.  He wears a shirt and a kind
               of skirt or similar garment draped over his lower body.  A shackle around his waist bears a chain that extends down
               to the ground and leftward towards the queen.  
               The Muses ("the sad Nine" in the letterpress text) rise into the sky in a procession to the left of and above the text box.  The
               foremost Muse faces away, curving her body in a "C" shape.  Her slightly bent right arm is extended up and to the right;
               her raised right palm faces up and supports a large closed book.  Her legs dangle down and to the right.  Her
               left foot, on tiptoe, appears just to the left of the text box, while her right foot is hidden behind it.  The middle
               of her body curves out to the left.  A ring of loosely delineated flowers, leaves, or other ornaments circles her head.
               Her long hair emerges from beneath it, floating left.  She wears a long-sleeved transparent gown that drapes her
               figure fluidly.  The body of the next Muse forms a similar shape, slightly to the left of and above the foremost Muse but
               mostly hidden behind her.  The feet of this Muse are not visible.  Her right arm extends up to the right, though her hand is
               hidden behind the book.  Though she faces away, she turns her head to the right so that the top half of her face is visible
               in partial profile.  Her long hair drapes her left shoulder, and she seems to wear a gown.  The heads of the other Muses,
               increasingly indistinct, extend up and to the right from the two foremost of their sisters.  A curved line above the back
               of the second nearest Muse indicates another curved body or bodies.  
               Wash surrounding the figures suggests the sky, perhaps with clouds.
               The queen and Vice sit on ground colored to suggest bare earth.  Vice casts a shadow that falls below him and to the right.

               surrounds the text box and fills the top two-thirds of the design.  Although Nature's body faces forward, she
               leans down to the right and her head, appearing to the right of the text box, is bent down to the right so that she
               can gaze at her child below.  Her right arm is raised and bent upward to the left of the text box.  The fingers of
               her raised right hand hold up the edge of a cloak or other cloth, which drapes over her raised
               right arm to the left, and down to the right over her head and left arm, where its folds meet the ground.  
               Her left arm is down
               but forward, over the edge of the bowl.  The fingers of her left hand rest on the large "golden keys" that "can
               unlock the gates of Joy" (see the letterpress text).  Her long, slightly curly hair falls past her left shoulder, while folds of the
               cloak or the long-sleeved shirt or gown she wears underneath drape over this shoulder and the edge of the bowl.
               In the crook of her elbow sits her nude child, facing left and slightly forward but bending
               his head far back to look up at his mother.  This is Shakespeare in his infancy.  He has short curly hair.  He sits with his left leg bent and drawn up
               beneath him and his left foot on tiptoe, while his right leg is extended leftward with knee bent up.  Both arms
               are raised at 135 degrees.  His hands are hidden in the folds of his mother's garments overhead.  His legs cast
               shadows on the ground below him.  The waters of the Avon river flow across the bottom of the design.  Nature's child
               is thus sitting on a riverbank, which is covered with grass.  Hedges or small trees appear at either side of the
               design above the bank.  Shadow darkens the underside of the hedge on the left, and a corner of riverbank at the
               right.  The figure of Sympathy, a young woman, runs leftward through the knee-high waters of the Avon.  The river
               is transparent enough that her lower body and even her feet remain visible.  She is seen in profile, facing left and leaning forward with
               her bent left leg forward, foot flat on the ground, and her right leg extended behind her.  Her right foot is on 
               tiptoe.  Her head is bent back slightly.  Her left arm is down by her side and bent forward at the elbow.  Her open
               left hand, with palm facing up, supports the lip of a bowl or vase tipped up on its side in front of her torso.
               Liquid, perhaps symbolizing tears, pours from the open mouth of this vessel and streams down and to the right into the
               Avon.  Sympathy wears a long-sleeved gown.  Her long
               hair flows over her shoulders and down her back.
               Wash around the edges of the golden bowl suggests the sky.

                  in profile, facing left and leaning forward with her bent left leg forward, foot flat on the ground, and her
                  right leg extended behind her.  Her right foot is on tiptoe.  Her head is bent back slightly.
                  Her left arm is down by her side and bent forward
                  at the elbow.  Her open left hand, with palm facing up, supports the lip of a bowl or vase tipped up on its side in
                  front of her torso.
                  Liquid, perhaps symbolizing tears, pours from the open mouth of this vessel and streams down and to the right
                  into the Avon.
                  Sympathy wears a long-sleeved gown.  Her long hair flows over her shoulders and down her back.

                  right of the text box, is bent down to the right so that she 
                  can gaze at her child below.  Her right arm is raised and bent upward to the left of the text box.  The fingers of her 
                  raised right hand hold up the edge of a cloak or other cloth, which drapes down to the left over her raised right arm,
                  and down to the right over her head and left arm, where its folds meet the ground.  Her left arm is down but forward,                  
                  over the edge of the bowl.  The fingers of her left hand rest on the large "golden keys" that "can unlock the gates
                  of Joy" (see the letterpress text), which lie on the riverbank.  
                  Her long, slightly curly hair falls past her left shoulder, while folds of the cloak or
                  the long-sleeved shirt or gown she wears underneath drape over this shoulder and the edge of the bowl.
                  In the crook of her elbow sits her nude child, facing left and slightly
                  forward but bending his
                  head far back to look up at his mother.  This is Shakespeare in his infancy.  He has short curly hair. 
                  He sits with his left leg bent and drawn up beneath him and his left foot
                  on tiptoe, while his right leg is extended leftward with knee bent up.  Both arms are raised at 135 degrees.  His hands
                  are hidden in the folds of his mother's garments overhead.  His legs cast shadows on the ground below him.

He faces right, but bends
               forward and lowers his head to look at an approaching swarm of small flying figures.  A lyre, decorated with a spiral
               carving along one side of the frame, rests lightly on his lap.  His bent right arm is down by his side and he plays
               the strings of the lyre with the fingers of this hand.  One slightly bent leg is extended along the floor.  The
               curly-haired poet wears a long-sleeved gown or robe with a collar.  The folds of this garment gather on the floor
               beneath his chair.  "Bright-eyed Fancy" is shown "hov'ring o'er" Dryden, releasing "Thoughts" and "words" from her
               "pictur'd urn" (see the letterpress text).  Her lower body is roughly horizontal, facing down, but she bends down at the waist and 
               turns her torso to the right and away from the viewer.  Her torso, upside down, is thus seen from behind.  Her head is
               bent back toward the viewer and twisted left, and she seems to look down at Dryden below.  Both arms are extended
               down and to the right.  She wears a long-sleeved gown with skirts that swirl up and away to the right, hiding her feet.
               She has short curly hair.  She holds an upside-down urn, on which is pictured two tiny figures: one is crowning the other
               with a wreath of laurels.  A wreath of laurel leaves also decorates the urn just below its lip.  Flames pour from the mouth of the urn and light the area nearby.  Within the flames appear
               the swarm of small flying female figures, which represent "the "Thoughts that breathe, and words that burn" that flow from
               the urn (see the letterpress text).  Most of the women bear gifts.  
               The foremost woman has just set free a bird that flies with its beak open as
               if in song.  The next woman supports a large grasshopper on her upraised right palm.  Above her another woman holds
               two serpents, one in each hand; the creatures writhe around her arms with open mouths.  A fourth woman bears a trailing
               branch of laurel.  The heads of three other women appear in the stream as well.  Together they all approach
               the poet.  The stool on 
               which the poet sits rests on a floor that seems to be made of earth, and extends the length of the bottom of the design.
               Part of a rainbow appears arching up from behind Dryden to meet Fancy.  Shadow fills much of the design around the
               figures, particularly at the left side of the design and in the upper right corner.  The poet and his stool also cast
               a shadow along the floor in the lower left corner.

               women amidst the flames.  Most bear gifts.  The leftmost woman flies or hovers with her body facing down and away,
               though she bends backward at the waist and tilts her head back to look up to the left.  She wears a loosely delineated
               gown and her hair is drawn back into a bun.  Her left leg extends
               out towards the viewer, so that the base of her foot is visible and the leg is foreshortened. Her right arm
               and right leg are not visible.               
               She extends her left arm up with hand raised and palm vertical.  A bird flies rightward from this upraised hand,
               with its wings spread and its beak open as if in song.
               The next woman to the right is visible only above the waist; the rest of her body is hidden by a woman next
               to her.  Her head is bent back and her hair is either short or drawn back.  She extends her right arm out
               roughly horizontally and supports a large grasshopper on her upraised right palm.  The insect's antennae are pictured.
               The third woman to the right flies or hovers shoulder-to-shoulder with the second-most woman.  Her torso faces down
               and to the right but her lower body merges upward with the flames pouring from the urn above.  Her left arm is extended
               along her side and she holds a trailing laurel branch in her left hand.  Her head is bent back and turned slightly away;
               she looks down to the left.  Her hair is drawn back into a bun or similar coiffure.  She is nude or wears a gown
               that leaves her breasts mostly exposed.
               Above the two shoulder-to-shoulder women flies or hovers another woman, upside down with her torso facing out and
               to the right.  Her lower body merges into the flames.
               Both of her arms are extended past her head and she holds a serpent in each hand; each snake has its
               mouth open and twists its body around one of the woman's arms.  The snake in her right hand makes a spiral with its
               writhing body.  The woman's head is tilted back and she looks before her
               to the left.  Her hair seems to be long and to fall behind her shoulders.  She seems to be nude.
               The heads of three other women appear between the woman with the snakes and the woman with the laurel
               branch.  All three of the heads are extended out towards the viewer.  The face of the leftmost head looks to the left
               and slightly down; its hair is drawn back into a bun or similar hairstyle.  The face of the rightmost head looks
               up to the right.  This woman may be wearing a bonnet, scarf, or similar headcovering over her hair.  The third head 
               looks to the right and only slightly up; her hair seems to be drawn back.  The eyes of all three women may be closed
               or downcast.

               They may be "such forms as glitter in the Muse's ray" (see the letterpress text) and the woman may be the muse.  She lies on her side or hovers roughly
               horizontally, facing forward with her legs extending to the right of the text box and her head appearing slightly
               above it to the left.  Her right arm is bent up at the elbow and propped out to the left, and she seems to be resting
               the side of her face in her right hand.  Her head is turned up and to the right and her eyes are raised.  Her mouth
               is open slightly.  Her long hair is caught in her right hand on the left, but it flutters freely away from the right
               of her head.  She is clad in a garment, perhaps a gown, that drapes her legs.  Her feet are indistinct.  To the left
               of the woman hovers a child, probably male, facing right and wearing a long gown that swathes his lower body.  His
               right arm is raised vertically and may rest along the woman's lower right arm.  The child's hand is hidden in the woman's hair
               but the shape of her locks suggests he may be touching her face.  He has short curly hair with longer lengths that blow
               leftward.  The second child, perhaps female, flies or hovers with her body in a horizontal position, facing down, above and to the right
               of the text box.  She wears a long gown that flutters rightward, hiding her feet.  Her arms are extended horizontally out
               from her body and she holds her hands out with palms facing up.  Her head is bent back and her face looks forward and
               to the left; she may be gazing at the woman nearby.  Her long hair flies rightward.
               Wash above and below the rainbow indicates a stormy sky.  Wavy lines extending down from the rainbow suggest rain.
               Shadows beneath the rainbow on the right add to the impression of rain.
               Near the bottom of the design, a nude boy or young man lies prone on a field of grain stems that has been knocked down.  The
               boy's body is stretched horizontally over the shafts, which likewise lie roughly horizontally along the ground.
               His legs extend out to the right, and his arms are stretched vertically over his head to the left.  His curly hair falls
               over the side of his face, obscuring it from view.
               A poet stands in contrapposto, facing away and slightly to the right, in the lower left corner of the design.  His weight
               rests on his right leg, which is straight; his left leg is bent slightly and his left foot is on tiptoe.  His bent arms are

               the Muse's ray" (see the letterpress text) and the woman may be the muse.  She lies on her side or hovers roughly horizontally, facing forward
               with her legs extending to the right of the text box
               and her head appearing slightly above it to the left.  Her right arm is bent up at the elbow and propped out to the left,
               and she seems to be resting the side of her face in her right hand.  Her head is turned up and to the right and her eyes
               are raised.  Her mouth is open slightly.  Her long hair is caught in her right hand on the left, but it flutters freely away
               from the right of her head.  She is clad in a garment, perhaps a gown, that drapes her legs.  Her feet are indistinct.
               To the left of the woman hovers a child, probably male, facing right and wearing a long gown that swathes his lower body.
               His right arm is raised vertically and may rest along the woman's lower right arm.  The child's hand is hidden in the woman's hair
               but the shape of her locks suggests he may be touching her face.  He has short curly hair with longer lengths that blow leftward.
               The second child, perhaps female, flies or hovers with her body in a horizontal position, facing down, above and to the right of the text box.
               She wears a long gown that flutters rightward, hiding her feet.  Her arms are extended horizontally out from her body and she
               holds her hands out with palms facing up.  Her head is bent back and her face looks forward and to the left; she may be gazing
               at the woman nearby.  Her long

               hand appear on the frame of his instrument.  He wears a long-sleeved robe decorated with small stars.

               135 degrees.  His bent left arm is raised and extended to the left.  He grasps a bloody lyre cord in his left
               fist, which is partly hidden behind the text box.  The fingers and thumb of his raised right hand rest on two
               different cords.  His left leg is bent forward and drawn up to the right; his left foot rests flat on the ground
               near one of the lyre cords.  His right leg, which may also be bent, is extended down behind him to the left.  His
               right foot is visible on lower ground in the lower left corner of the design, and seems to be on tiptoe.  He leans
               forward and to the right, and may be bending forward slightly at the waist.  The Bard wears a long-sleeved gown that
               drapes his lower body though both bare feet are visible.  He has a long beard and staring eyes.  His long wild hair
               flies to either side of his head.  His mouth may be open slightly.  Shadows appear between the lyre strings

                        He sits astride a horse, his lower body facing left.  Leaning far forward over its withers, he turns
               his body forward and twists his head to look up and slightly to the right.  His mouth is open and his eyes are wide.
               His left arm is drawn back, slightly bent, and his left hand rests on the horse's hip.  His right shoulder is down but
               his right hand is partly visible over the front of the horse's saddle, grasping its reins.  He wears a long-sleeved 
               tunic over a coat of mail, visible where it covers his left leg and foot, and where it forms a hood over his neck
               and head.  Alternatively, this head covering may be a helmet with chin and partial cheek guards.  A crown circles his
               head, over the mail or helmet, and a large plume surmounts both.  King Edward's horse kneels on the ground facing left.
               Its three visible legs are bent and drawn up beneath its body, which rests on a kind of ledge near the bottom of the design.
               It has lowered its head down past the ledge, and its eyes are closed.  Its mane cascades down over its arching neck and past
               its lowered head.  The king grasps its reins, though it does not wear a bridle.  A simple saddle sits on its back, and Edward's 
               left foot is in a stirrup.  The horse's one visible hoof, the left rear, bears a heavy horseshoe.
               The head and torso of King Edward's queen, Eleanor of Castile, appears to the left of his head.  The queen faces forward and slightly to the right,
               but leans left.  Her head is bent back slightly.  Her mouth is open and her eyes are raised.  Her right arm, slightly
               bent, extends horizontally across her torso to the right; her right hand may be resting on King Edward's right shoulder.
               She wears a crown over long, slightly curly hair that flows past her shoulders.  Her garment, a shirt or gown, has long
               sleeves.  Its folds may appear to the left of King Edward's horse's mane.  Alternatively, this area may represent part of
               another horse.  Two other soldiers in Edward's army are partly visible to the right of the text box.  These may be Mortimer and Gloucester, named in the letterpress text.  The head of the
               leftmost soldier faces forward and to the right.  It is bent back slightly and the soldier's eyes are raised to look up.
               This soldier has curly hair and a curly beard.  His shoulders, clad in a tunic, are visible above part of the back of a horse
               below.  Only the head of the rightmost soldier appears, bent back and looking up to the right.  This soldier has a beard and
               longer hair.  Both men seem to be looking up and listening to the bard's song in trepidation.
               Four spears appear above the text box and the heads of Edward and his soldiers.  Raised in parallel, they point from
               lower right to upper left.  The heads of two are hidden behind a branch thick with leaves above.  
               Edward's horse kneels on what seems to be a rocky ledge.  Wash in the background of the design may indicate the rocky face
               of a rising mountain, atop which the bard stands and sings.  Alternatively this wash may represent sky, perhaps at sunrise
               or sunset.

               forward with bent left leg drawn up beneath him and slightly bent right leg extended down to the left.  He bends or leans 
               forward slightly and raises both arms overhead at roughly 135 degrees.  His left arm, raised slightly higher than the right,
               extends beyond the edge of the design and is thus visible only to the elbow.  The right arm is slightly bent, and his raised
               right hand, palm down, hangs slightly from the wrist.  An oak branch curves up to the left from behind the giant-oak's back
               before arching down to the left over his right arm, splitting into smaller branches and scattered oak leaves that fill much
               of the space between the text box and the left side of the design.  Another branch follows the giant-oak's left arm up into
               the top right corner of the design, sending two smaller branches with leaves to the right.  Nearer the top of the design, it
               splits leftward into leafless branches; leaves that descend from the top of the design may hang from higher parts of this
               branch.  Additional leaves appear above the giant-oak's right shoulder and below his left arm.  He turns his head slightly
               left and wears a crown or hat made of leaves, with an acorn at each temple.  He has a long beard that merges with the lines
               of his body to suggest the curved trunk of an ancient tree.  The shape of his mustache suggests the shape of the oak leaves
               on his head; two additional oak leaf shapes appear where his beard grows from each cheek.  The hair at his temples suggests
               his hair is short.  His left foot seems to become a root growing rightward and down over the body of the personification
               of a cave, below.  His right foot is not visible.  The face of a second personified giant oak appears beneath the left armpit
               of the first.  This face looks forward and right, with open mouth and raised eyes.  He wears a similar crown or wreath of
               oak leaves.
               The personification of "the torrent" (see the letterpress text) appears in the lower left corner of the design.  It is difficult to tell
               whether this figure is male or female (probably the former).  Its face looks forward, tilted slightly down.  Its mouth is open and its teeth are
               visible.  Its long hair is parted in the middle over its forehead and extends down on either side of the face.  From there
               the hair blends into the lines of flowing water that run from beneath the text box down the left side and across the bottom
               of the design.  A beard may grow from the figure's cheeks and chin; alternatively these lines may be water lines that create a small waterfall.
               The female(?) personification of the "desert-cave" (see the letterpress text) appears lying on her side in the lower right corner of the design.
               Her head faces forward, but is also tilted back to look left.  Her mouth is open and her eyes are raised.  Her bent right
               arm is raised and propped beneath her head to the left; her right hand is beneath her forehead.  A wreath of thin leaves
               or similar ornament is on her head.  Her long hair streams over her left shoulder and her right hand.  She 
               may be wearing a gown that suggests the appearance of rocks beside the waters of the torrent.  Her head and shoulder support
               the weight of the foremost "giant-oak" above.  The oak's roots curl over her left shoulder.  Wash around the figures,
               particularly near the left side of the design, suggests the sky, perhaps with clouds.  Shadow fills the space between the
               right side of the design and the foremost giant-oak's left leg.

Although this is not, strictly speaking, a vegetating human figure, since the transformation is in the other direction, the figure is similar in appearance to vegetating figures elsewhere in Blake's art.

                  parts of this branch.  Additional leaves
                  appear above the giant-oak's right shoulder and below his left arm.  He turns his head slightly left and 
                  wears a crown or hat made of leaves, with
                  an acorn at each temple.  He has a long beard that merges with the lines of his body to suggest the curved trunk
                  of an ancient tree.  The shape of his mustache suggests the shape of the oak leaves on his head; 
                  two additional oak leaf shapes appear where his beard grows from each cheek.
                  The hair at his temples suggests his hair is short.
                  His left foot seems to become a root growing rightward and down over the body of the personification
                  of a cave, below.  His right foot is not visible.
                  The face of a second personified giant oak appears beneath the left armpit of the first.  This face looks forward and 
                  right, with open mouth and raised eyes.  He wears a similar crown or wreath of oak leaves; one leaf descends
                  into the space between his beard, the first giant oak's knee, and the edge of the design.

His head and torso
               face forward and slightly to the right; his body bends backwards at the waist and extends, roughly horizontally, away
               from the viewer and slightly left.  Of his lower body only his right leg, bent slightly upward, is clearly visible.  His 
               slightly bent left arm is raised at about 45 degrees, and he makes a pointing gesture with his left index finger.  His slightly
               bent right arm, which is partly obscured by the text box, is raised at 135 degrees.  He brandishes a scourge in his upraised
               right hand.  The weapon has three thongs with star-like spikes at their ends.  He wears a crown on his head, and has short hair and a short
               beard that stands on end in spiky points.  His eyes are cast down and he seems to be frowning.  His upper body is nude, but
               his lower body seems to be wrapped in a transparent garment that extends past his right leg.  The bent figure of Sorrow
               appears in the lower left corner of the design.  She walks facing right, bent over heavily at the waist.  Her arms are held
               forward and bent up at the elbow, and she buries her lowered face in her hands.  Her weight rests on her left leg and her
               right leg is extended backward, slightly bent, with right foot on tiptoe.  She wears a long gown below which her bare feet
               are visible.  Her hair is drawn back into a bun.
               Amazement and Flight personified flee rightward in the lower quadrant of the design.  Their bodies are nearly horizontal.
               Flight's body is foremost.  His left leg is bent and drawn up sharply beneath his body; his left foot is on tiptoe.  His
               bent right leg is extended behind him.  Both arms are stretched out straight in front of his lowered head.  His upper body is
               nude but he wears tights on his lower body.  Thin lines delineate shapes suggesting clouds of dust, perhaps caused by his
               rapid movement, to the right of his left foot.  Amazement, behind him and partly hidden by his body, cranes her head
               forward and up to the left to look at the menacing figure of Edward the Third above.  Her mouth is open wide and her 
               long hair streams to the left.  She 
               wears a long gown that extends behind her.  The small figure of Solitude stands in the lower left corner of the design, facing
               forward.  The figure's arms are down by his or her side, and seem to be clasped in front.  Other features of the figure's face,
               hair, and clothing are difficult to discern.
               Rolling hills constitute the landscape at the bottom of the design.  Sorrow, Amazement, and Flight move rightward over
               a gentle rise.  The ground here seems to be dirt or sand.  Solitude stands in a low area between distant hills.  The lowering
               sky in which Edward the Third hovers is heavy with clouds.  Penciled lines around the avenging king's figure, particularly below his chest, add to the effect, or
               may indicate movement.  The cloud cover breaks most noticeably in the upper left corner of the design, where an ominous
               light hints at a sunset or sunrise.

                  with his arms crossed over his chest.  His legs appear to be bent.  A robe, cloak, or blanket swathes his body, hiding
                  his hands and his legs below the knee.  A large horn curls around his right forearm.  Whirlwind's eyes are closed in sleep.  What seems to be the limb (an arm or leg)
                  of a previous victim emerges from
                  between his closed lips.  His short, spirally curly hair springs in all directions, as does the curly hair of his beard and
                  eyebrows.

He faces forward but leans to
               the right; his left elbow rests on the arm of his throne.  His bent left leg is forward, with his left foot resting on the
               ground beneath his seat, while his bent right leg is down, lower leg extended away.  His right arm is hidden beneath his garments,
               but seems to be bent across his chest with right hand resting near his left shoulder.  The king wears a robe that envelops his
               limbs almost entirely, although his left foot appears beneath its hem, clad in a shoe.  A crown sits atop his head, over short,
               raggedly curly hair.  His mouth is open and his eyes are raised; his cheeks are drawn and wan.  Although they almost appear to be accidental, the smudges or blotches covering his clothing suggest his dirty, possibly diseased, condition.
               The figure of Thirst personified sits in the lower right corner of the design, facing forward.  Both her(?) legs are bent;
               her right knee is drawn up while her left leg lies on the ground.  Her bony left foot emerges from beneath her skirts.
               Her partly hidden right arm is bent across her lap and may be resting against her right leg.  With the fingers of her right hand she
               grasps the stem of a goblet, upside down to signal its emptiness.  She bends her head back and twists it to the left to
               look up at Richard II in his throne.  Her mouth is slightly open.  Her wrinkled face and neck suggest age and/or dehydration.
               Her hair is drawn up into an unkempt coiffure.  She wears a shirt, through which her ribs are visible, and a skirt.
               Famine, personified as an old man, sits facing right in the lower left corner of the design.  His right leg is bent and may
               be crossed or folded beneath his body.  His right arm is extended down and rests against his right knee. With his right index
               finger he points to three maddeningly bread-like stones on the ground in front of the king's throne.  The other knuckles of Famine's
               right hand rest on the ground.  Famine is balding but has a long white beard and long hair growing from the back of his head.
               His mouth may be open.  He wears a robe or tunic that may be belted at the waist and that hides his lower body.  Additional fabric,
               perhaps a cloak, falls from his right shoulder to puddle on the ground behind him.  The king and his spectre-like
               companions sit inside the stone walls of Pontefract Castle.
               Mounted knights arrayed in opposing lines charge each other near the top of the design.  These forces represent the battles of
               the Wars of the Roses.  The top quarter of the design is dark with dust the knights have raised, or with storm, or perhaps
               due to the time of day.  A boar appears in the upper right corner of the design, facing forward and to the right.  It sits
               with its head lowered near to the ground, and "wallows" in clouds of dust and "infant gore" (see the letterpress text).  The boar is the emblem
               of Richard the Third.

               the head, forelegs, and body of the foremost horse is clearly visible, lunging rightward.  An armored knight astride this horse
               holds a shield facing forward and a spear lowered on the far side of the horse's head.  The head and foreleg of a second

He supports his queen, Eleanor of Castile, with his
               lowered right arm; his right hand is visible, palm forward, below her head.  His left arm is bent upward, and
               his left elbow seems to be propped on his knee or leg.  He rests his forehead in his raised left hand, bending
               low over his queen's upturned face.  His cloak, clasped over his right shoulder with a button or similar ornament,
               drapes his figure so completely that his lower body is impossible to distinguish.  He wears a crown and a large
               plume over his helmet and/or the chain mail that cloaks his head and neck.  His mouth may be open slightly.
               The queen, dying, lies supine along the ground at the bottom of the design.  Her upper body is propped against
               and supported by the kneeling king.  Her slightly bent legs extend together to the left.  Her bent left arm
               hangs at her side; her left hand lies palm up on the ground.  Her head sags backward and her long hair drapes
               over her left shoulder.  Her eyes are closed.  She wears a crown and a long gown with a high waist or belt.  Her
               left foot, visible beneath her gown,
               may be bare or may be clad in a slim shoe.  The rears of the royals' two horses are visible to the left
               of the king.  Both horses rest on the ground with their tails to the left.  Both wear saddles.  Images of the
               heads of the three bards appear in the clouds above the king and queen.  The heads are arranged in a line facing down.
               The two foremost bards hold their mouths open; the text box hides the lower half of the third bard's face.  The long
               hair and beards of all three bards stand on end, merging with the surrounding clouds that fill much of the
               top half of the design.  Coloring makes their hair look flame-like.  Dark shadows lurk at the clouds' edges, particularly in the upper left corner of the design,
               just to the left of the text box, and along the right side of the design.  Shadow also fills some of the lower
               left corner of the design.  The sky visible above and to the left of the horses suggests sunrise or sunset.
               Grass covers the ground on which the queen lies.  A leafy tree branch appears to the left of the text box.

               text box.  He may be seated on the steps that are visible to the right.  He faces forward, but bends his head
               down and to the left.  His legs are bent: his right foot is forward and his left foot drawn back.  He may be
               leaning forward slightly.  His right arm, bent at the elbow, rests on his right leg.  His left hand, palm up,
               is visible just to the left of the text box and may rest against his right knee.  A tiny fairy figure stands in 
               Spenser's open left palm, facing forward.  Spenser is dressed in a robe or gown, with extra fabric lying
               over his lap and draping his legs.  Two figures, personifying Truth and Fiction, stand at the top of the stairs
               on the right.  On the left, Truth is a young woman facing forward and stepping
               forward with her left foot, which is just visible beneath the long robe or gown she wears.  Her hair is long and loose.
               Her eyes are lowered or closed.  She holds an open book before her.  Fiction stands or walks to the right in a slightly contrapposto position, with his
               weight resting on his left leg and his right leg bent backwards.  He clasps a partially unrolled scroll with both hands.
               He wears a spiked ruff or collar.  He is nude or wears tights.  His eyes are raised and he has short curly hair and
               a similar beard.  Two tiny figures, reminiscent of fairies or cherubs, hover over the heads of Truth and Fiction.
               One plays a pipe and the other plays a horn.  
               In the lower left corner, three figures enact a scene from "Sir Guyon in the cave of Mammon," one of Spenser's poems.
               Surrounding clouds create a cave-like space.  Sir Guyon stands in the middle, facing left and holding a sword.  He is
               dressed in armor and wears a helmet with a large plume.  Mammon, an old man, stands on the left, facing forward but
               turning his head to the right to look at the knight.  With his slightly bent right arm, raised at 45 degrees, he points
               down at a mass of golden coins heaped on the floor below.  More coins lie scattered on the ground before Mammon's feet.
               He has long hair and a long beard and wears a gown.  A demon or devil walks to the left at the right side of the
               group.  He strides forward with his right leg; his left is bent and extended backward, with left foot on tiptoe.
               Both arms are down by his side but bent forward at the elbow.  Two horns spiral backwards from above his forehead.
               He has two large batlike wings.
               Above this grouping, three figures enact "Redcrosse in the cave of Despair."  Clouds form a 
               shadowy cave-like space as the setting for this scene.  Despair, an old man, sits on the left.  He bends forward
               and reaches his bent right arm up at 135 degrees; in his upraised right hand he holds a dagger pointed back
               at himself.  His head is bent back and he may be looking up at Redcrosse, who stands to the right and walks left.
               Redcrosse's left arm is forward and bent up; he buries his face in his upraised left hand.  He is nude and has
               short hair.  A third figure lies dead in front of Redcrosse and Despair, with a dagger buried in his bloody chest.
               Clouds create "C" shapes that fills much of the design and connects the disparate scenes of tiny figures.
               The sky upper left is dark.

           the right side of the design it becomes smaller branches that hang down and bear sparse leaves.  This may be a willow.  Two goats stand
           near the goatherd.  One goat, just beyond his legs, grazes facing left with head lowered to the grass.  
           The head of the other
           goat appears to the right of the nearby tree, facing right with mouth slightly open.  Both goats have horns and
           shaggy coats.  Dark, craggy mountains cross the design in the background.  A similar stone or boulder may provide some
           support for the back of the seated goatherd.  Grass covers the ground on which the goatherd sits and his goats graze.  A leafy branch or palm frond
           lies along the ground just below the goatherd, in the lower right corner of the design.  Similar vegetation may appear
           across the bottom of the design.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="CD"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>goatherd</characteristic><characteristic>shepherd</characteristic><characteristic>piper</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>sitting</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>facing down</characteristic><characteristic>head down</characteristic><characteristic>arm at side</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent</characteristic><characteristic>arm down</characteristic><characteristic>hand on ground</characteristic><characteristic>hand resting</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent</characteristic><characteristic>legs crossed</characteristic><characteristic>leg extended</characteristic><characteristic>breeches</characteristic><characteristic>button</characteristic><characteristic>shirt</characteristic><characteristic>tunic</characteristic><characteristic>melancholy</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>short hair</characteristic><characteristic>pipe</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A goatherd is seated at the bottom of the design, facing left.

            shadows on the hill below, but neither animal's body is visible past the midsection, as if horses and riders are

These may be the three named in the letterpress text, Object 72: Mista, Sangrida, and Hilda.  They 
               weave giant lances or arrowed spears like threads on a "loom"
               (see the letterpress text).  The foremost sister's bent left
            leg is extended so that her left foot rests on the floor at a distance from her seat.  She raises her left arm at 
            135 degrees and holds one giant spear or arrow in her upraised left hand.  This arm is hidden between wrist and
            shoulder by the text box.  She bends her head back slightly and looks up at her hand.  Her mouth is open
            slightly.  Her hair is drawn back into a bun and she wears a belted gown.  She may also wear a high-heeled shoe
            on her foot.  The backs of her sisters are visible to the right, and they seem to wear belted gowns like the
            foremost sister.  These two sisters' faces are hidden, but both grasp spears in their upraised left hands.
            Each sister makes a pointing gesture with her index finger along the shaft of the spear she holds.  The middle
            sister's hair is braided and twisted into a bun.  The rightmost sister's hair seems to be drawn into a bun-like

                  They weave giant lances or arrowed spears like threads on a "loom"
                  (see the letterpress text).  The foremost sister's bent left
                  leg is extended so that her left foot rests on the floor at a distance from her seat.  She raises her left
                  arm at 135 degrees and holds one giant spear or arrow in her upraised left hand.  This arm is hidden between
                  wrist and shoulder by the text box.  She bends her head back slightly
                  and looks up at her hand.  Her mouth is open slightly.  Her hair is drawn back into a bun and she wears a belted
                  gown.  She may also wear a high-heeled shoe on her foot.  The backs of her sisters are visible to the right,
                  and they seem to wear belted gowns like the foremost sister.
                  These two sisters' faces are hidden, but both grasp spears in their upraised left hands.  Each sister
                  makes a pointing gesture with her index finger along the shaft of the spear she holds.  
                  The middle sister's hair is braided and twisted
                  into a bun.  The rightmost sister's hair seems to be drawn into a bun-like coiffure.

The threads that form the
            warp at the left side of the design are made "of human entrails" (see the letterpress text).  They are weighted with four human heads that
            hang upside down near the lower left corner of the design.  All four heads face forward with closed eyes and open mouths.
            They are the heads of male "warrior[s]."  Three Fatal Sisters, still shoulder to shoulder, here
            kneel facing left on a kind of shelf or step in the lower right corner of the design.  These may be the three named in the letterpress text, Object 72: Mista, Sangrida, and Hilda.  The foremost sister's left leg
            is bent and drawn up beneath her body; her left foot is on tiptoe.  Her right leg is also bent, but her right foot is
            extended and rests on the chins of the human heads.  The foremost sister leans forward and extends her left arm out at
            an angle between horizontal and 135 degrees.  With this hand she grasps the handle of a large sword, pointing downward.
            This may be the sword "that once a monarch bore," which the text mentions should "[k]eep the tissue close and strong."
            It is wrapped with cloth or perhaps human entrails.  The foremost sister extends her right arm backwards at 135 degrees; with
            this hand she may be holding one of the arrowed spears that is poised over the sisters' heads.  This foremost sister wears
            a semi-transparent gown that drapes her form but reveals the position of her legs.  She also seems to be wearing sandals.
            The text box hides her face below the eyes.  Her long hair streams backwards over her shoulders and upraised right arm.
            Her sisters are visible above her and to the right, in positions that echo hers nearly exactly.  Both of these sisters
            in the rear raise their left arms in front at 135 degrees.  They may be helping to hold the warp threads.  Both also
            extend their right arms behind them at 135 degrees, and probably each grasp one of the three spears poised above, which they may be throwing or are about to throw.  The middle
            sister's loose curly hair is visible just above the head of the foremost sister.  The rearmost sister's braid appears just
            below the spears.  Shadow fills much of the empty spaces around the figures.  A particularly dark area appears to the right of

            billows in the wind of his movement.  His sandaled right foot appears to the left of the text box, in a stirrup.
            A second horse's head is visible to the right of the first, also facing down to the right.  The heads of two more

The foremost warrior sits astride a horse
               that rears or lunges facing left.  The animal lifts its bent front legs into the air and lowers its head so
               that its nose is on a level with its knees.  The heads of two other horses, behind the foremost horse, appear
               in an identical position to the left.  Diagonal lines crossing their noses may indicate reins.  The forelegs and
               abdomen of the next nearest horse may be just visible beneath the first horse's front legs; similarly, the
               far horses' rears may appear above the first horse's rump.  The soldier riding the first horse leans forward
               slightly over its neck.  His right arm is raised and drawn back, bent sharply behind his head so that the
               sword he grasps in his right hand points diagonally down towards the ground.  This rider wears armor and a
               helmet with a long plume that either merges with a cape, or flies behind his back like a cape.  The text box
               hides most of the rider's body but his armored left foot is visible in a stirrup just below the box's lower
               right corner.  The fingers of his left hand hold his horse's reins just to the left of the text box.  He has a
               mustache, and his short curly hair is just visible at his temple.  His mouth is open.  The head of a second
               mounted soldier, visible above the nose, appears facing left above the manes of the horses.  This soldier
               wears a helmet over short curly hair as well.  He holds a spear in his right hand, raised and drawn back above
               his head.  Round shapes to the left of his head may indicate more riders.
               A knight on the ground tries to defend himself against the mounted knights above.  This knight faces forward
               and leans his weight on his straight right arm, which is braced against the ground or perhaps against a fallen
               comrade.  Though his right leg is mostly hidden, his legs seem to be spread.  His bent left leg extends to the
               right and his left foot rests on the head or helmet of another fallen soldier.  He leans back and tilts his
               head sharply back to look up at the soldier astride a horse above him.  His mouth is open and his eyes are wide
               with terror.  His bent left arm is raised and drawn back, and with his left hand he grasps the hilt of a sword
               that points down at the ground behind him.  He is wearing a tunic over armor, or perhaps tights.  His head is
               covered by a helmet.  As in previous designs, a jumble of dead and dying bodies across the bottom of this design
               conveys the carnage of the battlefield.  The lower body of one such casualty appears in the lower right corner
               of the design.  Both knees are bent, and the soldier's feet rest on the back of another figure whose torso and
               head extend out towards the viewer.  This figure seems to face down, with right arm extended to the left along
               the ground, and left arm by his side or caught beneath his torso.  A spear or similar weapon emerges from beneath
               his body and lies on the ground pointing toward the viewer.  This figure wears armor, including a breastplate.
               A helmet that may or may not encase a head, visible near the lower right corner of the design, supports the
               foot of the soldier who brandishes a sword against the mounted warriors above.  A head with closed eyes and short
               hair fanned out on the ground faces up next to this helmet.  Another shape near the left edge of the design,
               supporting the hand of the living soldier, may be another head with face hidden by hair.
               The heads of many spears or arrows fill the top of the design.  Wash surrounding them and the figures suggests the sky,
               perhaps cloudy with storm or the dust of battle.

                  The head of a second mounted soldier, visible above the nose, appears facing left above
                  the manes of the horses.  This soldier wears a helmet over short curly hair as well.  He holds a spear in his right hand,

               the second item in his "Descent of Odin" series.  One butterfly or moth "spectre" hovers or flies above
               the text box.  The insect has two large antennae and a double set of wings open towards the viewer.
               A second butterfly or moth "spectre" hovers or flies facing left at the left side of the text box.  A fairy rests on
               its back, also facing left.  She(?) turns her head slightly forward.  Her arms are down in front of her, with
               her hands resting on the insect's head.  Her long hair, perhaps blown by the wind of their movement, stands
               on end.  One or perhaps both of her legs appear extended down the insect's back just beneath its near wing.
               The fairy may be nude, or the shape behind her legs and between the butterfly's wings may be her skirt or
               gown.  The butterfly has large antennae and three visible bent legs.  Its mouth is open.  Its wings are
               decorated with stars and eye-like spots.  The third "spectre" flies or hovers facing forward beneath the
               text box.  The most frightening of the flying creatures, this one suggests a bat.  Its decidedly batlike
               wings are spread to either side of its body.  Claw hands appear on either side of its face.  Its mouth is open
               in a threatening smile and a furry beard hangs from its chin.  A fairy woman rides the bat, facing forward and
               to the right with her left foot resting between the spectre's large ears.  Her left leg is slightly bent and
               her left foot may be on tiptoe; her right leg is bent and extended backwards.  She leans to the right and
               extends her left arm up at 135 degrees; she may be pointing with her left index finger, palm facing up.
               Her right arm is down by her side and bent up at the elbow.  Though her right hand is difficult to distinguish,
               at least one finger seems to rest on her chin.  She turns her head to the left, smiling with a sneer.  She is
               nude with visible breasts; her long hair blows to the left.  Pencil lines above her indicate that Blake first drew this figure slightly higher on the leaft, perhaps with wings.  Alternatively, this is a different bat-like creature not further developed.

               Its mouth is open.  Its wings are decorated with stars and eye-like spots.

The most frightening
               of the flying creatures, this one suggests a bat.  Its decidedly batlike wings are spread to either side of
               its body.  Claw hands appear on either side of its face.  Its mouth is open in a threatening smile and a
               furry beard hangs from its chin.
               A fairy woman rides the bat, facing forward and to the right with her left foot resting between the spectre's large
               ears.  Her left leg is slightly bent and her left foot may be on tiptoe; her right leg is bent and extended 
               backwards.  She leans to the right and 
               extends her left arm up at 135 degrees; she may be pointing with her left index finger, palm
               facing up.  Her right arm is down by her side and bent up at the elbow.  Though her right hand is difficult
               to distinguish, at least one finger seems to rest on her chin.  She turns her head to the left, smiling with
               a sneer.  She is nude with visible breasts; her long hair blows to the left.  Pencil lines above her indicate that Blake first drew this figure slightly higher on the leaft, perhaps with wings.  Alternatively, this is a different bat-like creature not further developed.  Other light pencil lines left and right of the large bat-like creature indicate that he was originally sketched at a larger size.</illusobjdesc></component></illustration></illusdesc><phystext><texthead justify="left"><l n="but335.1.wc.78.01" justify="left"><physnumber type="pen-and-ink">2</physnumber></l></texthead><vspace extent="4"/><lg type="prose" justify="left"><l n="but335.1.wc.78.02" justify="left" indent="30">The Descent of Odin</l></lg><vspace extent="1"/><lg type="prose" justify="left"><l n="but335.1.wc.78.03" justify="left" indent="28">1.

               facing down.  Her legs trail away to the left.  She twists and bends backwards at the waist so that her upper body
               turns forward; she further turns her head to look forward and to the left.  Her head is also bent back slightly.
               Her left arm is raised straight overhead, and her left hand is open with vertical palm facing forward.  Her right arm,
               which may be straight or may be slightly bent, is extended horizontally forward and to the left.  She grasps the
               stem of the goblet with her right hand.  Her mouth is open and her eyes are raised; she is probably speaking.  Her long hair blows backwards
               and to the left.  She wears a gown with a sleeve for her left arm, but that seems to leave her right arm exposed.
               The fabric of her garment obscures her legs and feet.
               The goblet the Prophetess holds contains honey, the "pure bev'rage of the bee" (see the letterpress text).  The goblet is shaped like a chambered nautilus and may be made of that shell.  The "shield of gold" (see the letterpress text) hangs in the upper left corner
               of the design.  It is decorated with a scalloped border and a starlike engraving at the center.  Shadows fill much of
               the design.  They are particularly dark near the bottom, where there may be clouds, and become increasingly lighter nearer the top of the design.

               He leans forward in his haste, with his bent left leg drawn forward and up and his bent right leg extended
               behind him.  His right foot is on tiptoe.  Indistinctly outlined casualties of battle litter the bottom of
               the design, and the ground is not clearly delineated, giving the impression that the runner leaps or even flies
               through or over his fallen comrades.  He raises his bent right arm upward at approximately 135 degrees, and
               grasps the diagonally slanted pole of his flag with his right hand.  He crushes some of the flag's material
               in his grip.  His head is bent back and turned partway forward, and his mouth is open as if in a cry.  Though
               he is dressed from neck to toes in armor, his head is bare; his rather long hair flies free.  The fabric of
               his flag ripples past him and billows in his wake.
               The scattered bodies of soldiers, the casualties of battle, lie on the ground extending into the distance.
               Some are alive while others seem to be dead or dying.  The upper body of one such casualty appears to the right
               of the running standard-bearer's left leg.  This soldier leans on his elbow, right arm bent, facing down with
               his head lowered.  His eyes are closed.  He may be lying across a body, difficult to distinguish, beneath his
               torso.  He wears armor, including a helmet.  Above him is visible the head and shoulders of a soldier who
               faces forward and to the left, his head tilted back, his eyes raised, and his mouth open wide.  He may be crying out in pain.  This soldier
               wears a helmet.  Three other helmeted heads are faintly visible above his, receding into the distance.  The 
               nearest may be facing away.  Another head appears lying on the ground and looking up, beneath the standard-bearer's
               right knee.  This helmeted head extends out towards the viewer.  Other tangled lines
               along the ground suggest additional crumpled bodies.  The top of a spear, pointing diagonally upward, appears
               in the upper left corner of the design.  The shafts of additional raised weapons are visible below, between the
               left edge of the design and the billowing flag.  Wash near the top of the design suggests the sky, perhaps with
               dark clouds in the upper right corner and down the right side of the design.  Alternatively this may be
               battlefield dust or smoke.  The running standard-bearer casts a shadow on the ground, which joins other shadows amidst
               the scattered bodies below him.

               At the left side of the table, one man sits facing right with his slightly bent right arm lying on his lap
               and his right hand resting on his knee.  He holds a large goblet before his torso with his raised left hand.
               His right leg is bent and drawn back, right foot on tiptoe, while his left foot rests on the ground beneath the
               table.  He is wearing tights, perhaps with a belt, and has a beard and short curly hair.  His feet are clad in
               slim shoes.  To the right appears the head and torso of a second man, facing forward and to the right.  This man
               also has a beard and short curly hair.  Below the table his garment seems to be a gown.  The head of a third man
               is visible between the text box and the head of the second man.  This man faces right and has a long beard and longer
               hair.  Behind the table, to the right of the text box, a fourth man sits facing forward.  He turns his head slightly
               to the left, and has a short beard and short hair.  He is dressed in a shirt or gown with a decorative collar, or perhaps
               a gorget or necklace hung around his neck.  A fifth man, far right, rests his chin on his right hand, which rests in turn on the left
               shoulder of the man who faces forward.  This older man, balding with white hair at his temples and a long beard,
               seems to be the oldest at the table.  Only his head and hand are visible.  The heavy wooden table around which
               the men sit at the lower right corner of the design has an ornately carved leg, or central pillar, the top of which is in shadow. 
               A large bowl, decorated with
               scrollwork vines and blossoms(?), sits on its surface.  The diagonal lines extending out of the bowl to the right may be the handle of a serving instrument of some sort, perhaps a spoon or ladle.  
               A young man stands or walks at 
               the left side of the design.  He faces to the right but turns his head away, so that his face is not visible.  He rests
               his weight on his left leg and extends his bent right leg backwards slightly; his right foot is on tiptoe.  He
               wears tights or a short tunic or gown; his lower legs and feet are bare.  His right arm is down by his side and he holds
               the handle of a pitcher with his right hand.  He has short curly hair.  Both he and the leftmost seated man cast
               shadows on the ground below.
               The outdoor feast seems to be taking place within a building, possibly a gazebo, that is open on at least one side.  The top of a pillar appears above the text
               box, supporting an arched partial wall.  At the left a taller pillar or post forms part of a doorway that
               extends beyond the left edge of the design.  A cypress-like tree appears within this open doorway.  The trunks
               and leafy branches of at least four other trees are visible between the arches of the gazebo.  Grass covers the 
               ground on which the table rests.  Mountain peaks appear in the distance, above the heads of the seated men.

                  may be singing or speaking, as well as playing the harp.  He has
                  long hair and a beard, and wears a robe that drapes his body completely and rests on the floor below;
                  its shape reveals that at least his left leg is bent.  The robe is decorated with small stars.

               bends forward and slightly to the right.  He raises his bent right arm up at 135 degrees and brandishes
               a sword in his upraised right fist.  His left hand appears above the top of the text box, holding up a
               shield.  His mouth is open, perhaps in a shout.  He wears a full suit of armor, including a helmet with
               a large feathered plume.  Lines visible between his legs, below his right arm, to the lower left of the text
               box, and to the right of his upraised sword suggest his quick movement.  The twisting or spiraling lines above his head are flame-like.  Several vanquished warriors lie in contorted

               back and out towards the viewer at an unnatural angle. The body of the second casualty appears above the first.
               This figure faces away with his body upside down and his head and shoulders hidden behind the first.  His
               lower body is twisted slightly to the left.  His right leg is bent forward and drawn up with the bottom of his right foot prominent.  His left leg is
               bent but leans to the right; the lower leg extends beyond the edge of the design.  His right arm and bent elbow
               are visible extended horizontally to the left.  Both of these soldiers are nude.
               The head and arm of an upright soldier are visible near the upper right corner of the design.  This soldier
               wears a helmet and faces left.  His right arm is lifted overhead and bent backwards sharply, so that his
               fist is behind his head.  He grasps the handle of a downward pointing sword with this hand.  This arm seems
               to be clad in armor.  A large shield hides the rest of his torso from view.  The ground beneath the soldiers
               is pocked as if with the imprints of many feet.  Above, the space around the figures is dark with shadow.

                  The leftmost soldier is visible only as a head, which appears next to the left edge of the design.  
                  This short-haired
                  soldier faces forward.  His mouth is open and his eyes may be crossed.  The top of his shield appears
                  above and to the left of the shield held by the soldier in front of him.
                  This second soldier stands with bent
                  legs spread and shield held up to hide his torso.  He looks forward and to the left with his mouth
                  open and his eyebrows drawn into a frown.  He wears armor and has short hair and a beard.  
                  The armored right leg of a third soldier, whose torso is hidden behind his shield and whose head is
                  hidden behind the text box, is partly visible behind the second soldier's left leg.  Part of this third
                  soldier's left leg appears to the left of a fourth soldier's right thigh.  This fourth soldier stands
                  next in line with his bent legs spread and braced.  His head, which appears above his raised shield,
                  faces mostly left and is visible in three-quarters profile.  He has short hair.
                  The soldier second from the right faces forward and slightly right.  He leans to the right slightly.
                  Like his fellows, his bent legs
                  are spread.  A shield hides his right arm and part of his torso.  His left arm is by his side and bent
                  forward; he holds the handle of a downward pointing sword in his left hand.  He wears a full suit of armor,
                  including a helmet.  His head, bent back slightly, faces forward and slightly left.  His eyes are raised
                  and his mouth is open.  
                  Only the head and perhaps the left shoulder of the rightmost soldier are visible
                  over his own shield.  He too looks forward and to the left, with head bent slightly back and mouth open.  Those with open mouths may be shouting or screaming.

               His feet are just visible beneath the hem, and his left foot may be on tiptoe.  Mostly bald, he has hair at
               his temples and a long beard.  A "traveller" (see Blake's text, Object 86) faces and walks left at the right side of the design.  His

               A gentle mound or hill rises in the background.  The ground on which the traveler and his host stand seems

                  slightly bent.  She holds a trumpet in each upraised hand, although her left hand partly
                  extends beyond the edge of the design; the instrument in this hand is similarly only partly visible.
                  Her right leg is down, with her foot on tiptoe, but she holds her left leg back and to the left.  
                  Her large wings
                  are spread on either side of her body, and a pair of eyes and ears, one on each wing, appear above her head.
                  A long gown drapes her figure, revealing as much as it conceals though its trailing skirt 
                  hides her left foot.  
                  This garment has a belt or high waistline from

                  may be tilted slightly back.  A star glimmers above her head, between her wings.

               design.  The Genius stands on higher ground to the left, his body largely hidden by the text box.  He faces
               forward and to the right, and seems to bend forward slightly with slightly lowered head.  He holds both arms
               out straight, the right raised at 135 degrees and drawn back, the left at 45 degrees and drawn forward.  With
               his right he holds what may be flames or a stack of lightning bolts like the jagged bolts that appear to either side of his
               body.  He holds his left hand out flat, palm down.  He may have just cast the bolt to the right with his extended
               left hand.  His long curly hair flies wildly behind him.  He wears a long gown that trails on the ground.  
               His right foot is visible emerging from beneath it.
               The foremost figure in the "midnight crew" below is the personification of Servitude as a woman whose legs are
               becoming a scaly demon's tail (see the letterpress text for this figure and the others identified here).  A weighty chain loops her twisted body.  At her feet lies the female figure
               of Flattery, whose body curls into a "serpent-train" (see the letterpress text) partly visible through Servitude's tail.
               Her face is made up garishly.  A serpent's head replaces her right hand.  The remaining two figures are not easily identified.  To the right of Servitude may be the upper body and head of Ignorance, whose body faces right but whose face is turned up to the left, mouth open.  His short hair is curly.  Below him may be the head and shoulders of a personification of Sloth, facing up.  Comus himself does not appear to be pictured.  Flattery, Sloth, and Ignorance all seem to be
               wrapped in cloth-like garments, as is Servitude's upper body.  The ground at the bottom of the design
               rises gently from right to left, into a slight hill.  It appears to be covered with grass.
               The sky above the hill is mostly dark, perhaps with clouds or night.  A particularly dark shadow appears 
               behind the Genius.  Another dark shadow falls on the ground near the lower left corner of the design.  Lightning bolts appear left and right of the text panel.

She is
               a woman whose body faces forward and to the right, though she bends her head back and twists it up 
               to the left.  Her legs are blending together 
               below the waist into a scaly demon tail, which curves up to the left
               and back down again into a spiral loop.  Her tail ends in an arrow or spear point.  Her arms are raised in front of her torso and bent up.
               The sleeves of the shirt she wears seems to hide her hands.  Alternatively, her upper body may
               be wrapped with cloth.
               A weighty chain emerges from between her
               wrists and loops around her back.  A segment of chain is visible to the right of her tail as well.  Her 
               hair is long and flies in jagged shapes around and behind her torso.
               At her feet appears the female figure of Flattery, who lies prone along the ground. Her body curls into a 
               "serpent-train" (see the letterpress text) partly visible through Servitude's tail.  She turns her head, which extends
               out to the right, to the left.  Her face is made up garishly.  Her extended right arm rests on the
               ground beneath her head; she may be partly resting her head on this arm.
               Her right hand is a serpent's head facing away.  She seems to be wrapped in cloth or a similarly 
               draped garment.  Her hair is short, or long and swept back behind her head.  The remaining two figures are not easily identified.
               Above Flattery may be the head and shoulders of Sloth, extended out towards the viewer.  
               Sloth's face is 
               seen from above, turned up to the left.  He is bald except for the suggestion of wispy hair above his
               temples.  Above him may be Ignorance, his body facing right and his head raised to look forward and 
               to the left.
               Ignorance's mouth is open and his eyes are raised.  He has short, curly hair.  Both he
               and Sloth are wrapped in cloth below the neck.  Pencil lines around the figures indicate different, but rejected, positions for them.

               Newton faces forward, turning his head slightly left.  His right elbow
               is propped on the cloud, slightly away from his body, and his lower arm is bent up.  He rests his chin on his 
               raised right hand and lowers his eyes slightly.  He has short curly hair and wears a gown or robe with a decorative
               border at the hem of his sleeve.  "Milton" (see Blake's text, Object 94) sits in a chair below and to the left of the text box.  He faces 
               forward.  Both of his legs are bent; his right leg is forward and his left leg is drawn back and to the side.
               His left foot may be on tiptoe.  Milton's lyre, a "deep-ton'd shell" (see the letterpress text), rests on his lowered left knee.
               The poet supports the instrument with his left arm: his left elbow is visible just to the right of the shell and his
               upper arm is bent upward behind and to the right side of the instrument.  His right elbow is forward, resting on
               his right leg, and his right lower arm is bent up across his torso.  He plays the strings of the lyre with his
               right hand.  His head is inclined and turned slightly to the right but his eyes are raised.  He has flowing long
               locks of hair and wears a robe or gown.  The lower frame of the lyre is in the shape of a shell.  The arms and the right front leg of the chair in which Milton sits are
               visible.  To the left of Milton's chair a vine grows up beside the left edge of the design.  It forms a loop
               to the left of Milton's shoulder.  On the right side of Milton's
               chair grow two flowers.  A sunflower is rooted near his left foot, bearing a single flower and three leaves.  Near the right side of the design grows a lily,
               its slender stem curving left over the top of the sunflower plant.  The lily bears a single blossom, which hangs
               facing downward to the left of the sunflower.  Three leaves grow from the ground where the lily is rooted.  A
               fourth appendage may be a dead leaf or a truncated stem.  The ground below Milton is covered with grass.

               of the design (see "Camus" in the letterpress text here and "Camus," Blake's text, Object 94).  He faces forward and slightly right, with his head lowered.  His arms are crossed over 
               his chest, right over left, and his hands are hidden within the sleeves of the robe he wears.  His posture and expression suggest "Melancholy" (see the letterpress text).  Two large
               trees are rooted on the bank of the river.  Their trunks rise to either side of Milton.  The tree on the
               right grows up past the right side of the design, sending large leafless branches up into the right corner.
               The bare roots of the second tree clutch the edge of the bank and dangle in the water below.  The tree's
               trunk leans to the left.  Its bare branches fill the top left corner of the design.  Each tree sends a branch
               diagonally into the middle of the design; they cross above the text box to form a pointed, Gothic-style
               arch over the scene, which echoes the Gothic architecture of the building in the distance.

               over the text box, and also beneath the tree branches at the right side of the design, suggests the

               mid-air in this design (see the letterpress text here and Blake's text, Object 94).  Edward the Third, partly hidden by the text panel, 
               faces forward and slightly to the left.  He holds his arms out at 45 degrees
               on either side of his body; his hands are out with palms down.  Lily blossoms tumble down from his open hands.
               Semi-circular lines below and to the left of his left hand suggest the sweeping motion he has just made with this
               limb as he casts the flowers.  His legs are bent and extend downward at an angle towards the lower left corner
               of the design, giving the impression that he leans to the right.  His right leg may be bent slightly more than
               his left, as his right foot seems farther back.  He may bend forward slightly at the waist, or his legs may be
               drawn up slightly.  His head is turned to the left so that his face is seen in three-quarters profile.  He has
               long hair and a long beard that covers most of his torso, although the text box hides part of both beard and body.
               A wreath of lilies and leaves circles his head like a crown, and frames his face.  Lines at his wrists suggest
               that he is wearing a shirt, but whatever garment may clothe his lower body is difficult to distinguish; he may
               wear tights.  Margaret of Anjou's head and shoulders appear to the right of Edward's left shoulder.  Her
               shoulders face forward and to the right; she turns her head forward and cuts her eyes to the left.  Her torso
               and lower body, just visible to the right of Edward's body, extend diagonally down towards the lower left corner
               of the design.  She raises her left arm up; her upper arm is lifted at 135 degrees and her lower arm is bent to vertical.
               Her left hand extends beyond the edge of the design.  A spiky crown boasting small jewels rests on her head.
               Her long hair appears to be drawn back at the nape of her neck, from where it flows past her right shoulder.
               She wears a gown with a flowing skirt; its folds may appear between and to the right of Edward's feet.
               The head and upper body of a man at the left side of the design may be Henry the Sixth.  His torso faces forward and
               perhaps slightly left, while he turns his head slightly right.  His right arm is by his side and bent across
               his chest, supporting a large "Holy Bible" (see the Textual Transcription).  The fingers of his left hand, visible just to the left of Richard's right
               hand, hold the book from below.  Henry the Sixth wears a shirt and pleated breeches or perhaps a gown, with folds of fabric
               visible just below his lower right arm.  He is bearded and a wreath of laurels sits on his short curly hair.
               A faint, indistinct face is partially visible to the left of Henry the Sixth's head.  The face seems to have long hair
               and may be female.  She looks forward and to the left.  She is hidden below the nose.  Her left shoulder may be
               just visible over Henry's left shoulder.  She may be "Chatillon," the Countess of Pembroke (see the letterpress text).  Wash surrounding the figures suggests the sky, perhaps at sunrise or sunset.
               The figures themselves are largely in shadow.  Particularly dark shadows appear below Edward's right arm, to the left
               of his right hand, below the text box, and to the right of Margaret of Anjou.

His right leg
               is bent and crossed over his bent left leg.  He bends his head and looks down at his daughter, who is seated on
               the floor below him to the right.  His entire body is enveloped in a cloak or blanket that covers him from neck
               to ankles.  The shape of the fabric suggests that his arms are by his side but bent up at the elbows so his
               lower arms cross his chest; his left hand rests on and perhaps holds the right.  He wears shoes and has long hair
               that may be plaited behind his head.  The right arm and legs of his armchair are visible.
               Mrs. Clarke's daughter sits on the floor before the hearth
               with an open book on her lap.  She faces forward and to the right, her legs bent and the book spread on her knees.
               Her left hand is down by her side, bent forward with her lower left arm supporting the book and her left hand holding
               its corner.  Her right arm is likewise by her side but bent; her right hand rests on her knee and holds the edge of the
               book.  She tilts her head and turns it to the left to look up with raised eyes at her father.  Her long curly hair
               is loose over her shoulders.  She wears a long gown with skirts that sweep left on the floor.
               A large, ornate fireplace appears at the right side of the design.  Scrollwork decorates the fireplace surround (which includes pictures of a few human figures) and
               the panel above the mantel.  A low fender separates the hearth from the rest of the floor.  A grate with glowing coals or embers appears within the fireplace.  Two fire
               implements rest against the side of the fireplace.  On the mantel shelf rest three objects: a small statue and two
               small obelisks.  Like the obelisks, the statue is depicted only sketchily, but it appears to be of a standing human
               figure facing forward.
               The room in which father and daughter sit is otherwise stark and bare.  The floor appears to be made of stone.
               Shadows fill the spaces above the father and daughter and around the text panel.  The father's chair casts a particularly
               dark shadow on the floor below and behind him.  Diagonal lines across the design from top edge to left edge suggest
               a curtain or similar drapery.

This decoration includes the picture of a seated figure in a circle at the top left corner of the surround.  The figure hunches over, facing right.  The decoration below the mantle would seem to include vague indications of other human figures.  The one furthest left may be floating, facing forward, with arms raised horizontally. 
               A low fender separates the hearth from the rest of the floor.  Two fire implements rest against the
               side of the fireplace.  One looks like a shovel, the other a bit like an oversize ladle.  On the mantel shelf rest three objects: a small statue and two small obelisks.
               Like the obelisks, the statue is depicted only sketchily, but it appears to be of a standing human figure

She seems to be about to envelop the scene below.  She faces down, her head perhaps tilted partly back so 
               that her face is visible from above.  Her body is entirely hidden by her garments, which sweep up to the left.  She
               seems to wear a hood, wimple, and gown.  Her eyes may be lowered or closed.  The poet Gray stands in the lower
               right corner of the design, facing away and to the left.  He bends his head to look up at the figure of Darkness hovering
               above.  He wears a voluminous robe or gown that hides much of his body.  His left arm is by his side and bent up with
               hand raised and palm out.  His left foot is on tiptoe and his left leg may be slightly bent and extended backwards.
               He may be wearing a shoe on this foot.  The other foot is not visible.  He has short, curly hair.  The right side of his
               body is in shadow, and he casts a shadow on the ground below him to the right.  In the middle distance, a plowman
               bent over with exhaustion walks to the right, just below the text box.  He steps forward with his bent
               right leg, his bent left leg extended behind him and his left foot on tiptoe.  His right arm is down by his side and he
               holds a strap around a small cask or barrel with his right hand.  His body is bent and leaning forward markedly, and his head is
               lowered but bent back to look forward.  He wears a hat over his bedraggled hair, and is dressed in tights and buttoned boots.  His eyes are closed or lowered.  A tired plowhorse walks on his far side, its head lowered
               to the ground.  The shaggy animal is still wearing a harness.  Its eyes are closed or lowered as well.  A second horse,
               drawn less distinctly, walks ahead of the first plowhorse.  This animal is partly hidden behind the poet's figure in the
               foreground.  At its head a second figure stands, facing away and slightly to the right.  This figure, probably male, may have short curly hair.  Similarly, he may wear a shirt and
               pants with a belt.  His left leg is bent forward slightly and his left arm is by his side, bent.
               His right arm is down but bent up at the elbow, and he holds a large bow, staff, or other implement with this hand.
               The men and horses walk at the edge of a plowed field that stretches from the right edge of the design nearly
               across to the left edge.  An abandoned plow rests in the plowed earth at the left side of the field.  The poet stands
               on a dirt path or road that winds up from the bottom edge of the design past the field towards the church in the distance.
               A stone mile marker sits in the field at the edge of the path, below the plow and to the left of the poet.  It appears to be inscribed, rather crudely, "22" (see the Textual Transcription).  The ground
               slopes gently upward from left to right across the design, suggesting a small hill or rise.  A large church with a steeple rises in the background, to the left of the text box.  The "Curfew" may toll from this church's bell
               (see the letterpress text).  The ground on either side of the field and path is covered with grass.  Trees or a hedge hides the lower part of the church in the distance.  Wash between the horizon and the figure of Darkness at the top of the design suggests 
               the sky.  Appropriately, the sky above Darkness is darker than the sky below, as if she does indeed trail the
               darkness of night after her descending form.

               a plowman bent with exhaustion walks to the right past the poet, just below the
               text box.  He steps forward with his bent right leg, his bent left leg extended behind him and his left foot on tiptoe.
               His right arm is down by his side and he holds a strap around a small cask or barrel with his right hand.  His body is bent
               and leaning forward markedly, and his head is lowered but bent back to look forward.  
               He wears a hat over his bedraggled hair, and is dressed in
               tights and buttoned boots.  His eyes are closed or lowered.
               A tired plowhorse walks on his far side, its head lowered to the ground.  The shaggy
               animal is still wearing a harness.  Its eyes are closed or lowered as well.
               A second horse, drawn less distinctly, walks ahead of the first plowhorse. 
               This animal is partly hidden behind the poet's figure in the foreground.  At its head a second figure stands,
               facing away and slightly to the right.  This figure, probably male, may have short curly
               hair.  Similarly, he may wear a shirt and pants with a belt.
               His left leg is bent forward slightly and his left arm is by its side, bent.  His right arm is down but bent up at
               the elbow, and he holds a large bow, staff, or other implement with this hand.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="object" location="CD"><characteristic>hill</characteristic><characteristic>plow</characteristic><characteristic>earth</characteristic><characteristic>stone</characteristic><characteristic>path</characteristic><characteristic>road</characteristic><characteristic>inscription</characteristic><characteristic>text</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The farmers and horses walk at the edge of a plowed field that stretches from the right edge of

               A stone mile marker sits in the field at the edge of the path, below the plow and to the left of the poet.  It seems to be inscribed, rather crudely, "22" (see the Textual Transcription).

               her three children.  She faces right and bows her head deeply; her arms are by her side, bent across her chest with
               hands raised and clasped beneath her head as if she is praying.  She wears a black cloak or robe that envelops her
               form entirely.  Even her face is hidden by its hood.  Her three children are also all dressed in black cloaks or robes
               with hoods.  The little family grouping stands beside a newly dug grave, which yawns across the bottom of the
               design.  Shadow fills its open mouth.  A clergyman stands on the far side of the grave, at the right side of the design.
               He faces forward and slightly left, with eyes raised and mouth open, perhaps leading the grieving family through the
               burial service.  Both arms are down.  His lower right arm is bent up across his body, and his right hand rests palm
               down on his chest.  His lower left arm is bent forward and he holds a book, perhaps a Bible, with this hand.  His
               thumb marks his place in the open book, which faces out.  He wears a neck scarf and a clerical
               gown or robe over shoes.  He has short curly hair.  The sexton or grave digger stands between the clergyman and the grieving
               family, and is mostly hidden behind the text box.  He faces forward.  His bent right arm and hand, which grasps the
               handle of a shovel, appears to the left of the text panel.  His left hand is visible below the text box, holding the
               shaft of the shovel, which is poised with a load of dirt over the open grave.  His legs are also visible below the text
               box; his right leg is bent slightly forward and his right foot rests on the ball and toes in a near-tiptoe position.
               From his visible limbs it appears the sexton wears a long coat over a shirt, breeches, and stockings.  His shoes have
               buckles.  A pile of earth lies, ready to be shoveled back into the grave, at the left of his feet.  A stone wall
               appears in the middle distance, behind the family and the churchmen.  It runs from the left edge of the design
               nearly all the way across the design, ending just to the right of the clergyman.  This may be the side of a tomb.  The odd shape just left of the grave digger's right knee may be something, such as an angel's wing, decorating the tomb.  The ground on which the family
               and the churchmen stand is mostly bare earth, but some grass grows around the feet of the clergyman at the right
               side of the design.  The trunk of a tree grows up the right side of the design, sending a leafy branch leftward from the
               top right corner.  The leafy canopies of two more trees appear in the background, to the left of the text panel.  The
               tree in the middle, next to the panel, also has visible branches.  Wash in the background suggests the sky, perhaps
               with clouds.  The color of the wash between the clergyman and the tree branch above hints that the time may be
               sunrise or sunset.

               The leftmost child stands in front of her mother; she is foremost of the group and nearest the left edge of
               the design.  This child faces right and bows her head slightly.  Her eyes are lowered and her mouth is open
               slightly.  The shape of her cloak suggests that one or both arms may be bent and folded or crossed over her chest.
               Long hair escapes from the edges of her hood.  The second child stands to the right of the mother and lowers
               his or her head more deeply, facing forward and to the right.  Beneath the gown he or she wears, this
               child raises one or both hands to his or her face, hiding it below the eyes.
               He or she may be crying.
               The rightmost child faces forward with head slightly bowed and eyes lowered or closed.  Long hair
               visible at the edges of her hood suggests that her gender is female.  Her mouth is open as if she

His body faces forward and to
               the right.  He rests his weight on his slightly bent right leg; his left leg is bent and drawn up and his left foot
               rests on a shovel, helping to drive it into the ground.  He bends forward at the waist with the effort, twisting
               his torso forward and leaning into the work.  His right arm is bent and drawn back and he holds the handle of the
               shovel with this hand.  His left arm, slightly bent, is down.  He grasps the shaft of the implement with this hand.
               His left elbow may be braced against the inside of his left thigh.  His head is bent and he looks down at his work.
               He is dressed in a shirt, breeches, stockings, and shoes.  His muscular frame shows clearly through the clothes, 
               particularly in his arms, and above the open neckline of his shirt.  He has short curly hair beneath a hat.
               His shadow falls on the ground below him and to the left of his feet. 
               A boy beneath the text panel walks to the left.  He faces away and to the left, so is seen partly from behind.  His
               weight rests on his right foot; his slightly bent left leg is extended behind him with his left foot on tiptoe.
               His left arm, at his side, is bent at the elbow.  His head is bent slightly.  He wears a shirt and breeches, or
               perhaps tights with a belt, with stockings and shoes.  His shirt has a wide collar.  His short, curly hair is
               unruly beneath his hat.  He walks along the edge of grass, perhaps in the middle of a path although the coloring hints at water.  Two windswept trees grow in the middle distance, near the right
               edge of the design.  Their branches are partly bare and partly covered with leaves.  The path on which the boy walks includes a patch of grass, which also grows on the smaller hill or hills behind the trees.
               Larger hills or mountains appear in the distance, on the horizon.  
               Wash to the right of the text box indicates the sky.  A dark cloud fills the upper left corner of the design.

               forward and his right is extended backwards, with his right foot on tiptoe.  He twists at the waist so that his torso

               of the paper.  Indecipherable text appears on the document.  He wears a hat and a robe with fur trim over an ascot or similar necktie.  The sturdy farmer stands
               at the right side of the design, facing forward and to the left.  He turns his head towards the bailiff so that his
               face is seen in three-quarters profile.  His right arm is slightly bent and down by his side and he holds the handle
               of a shovel with this hand.  The shovel stands upright next to his right leg, which is bent slightly forward; the 
               shovel's head rests on the ground next to his right foot.  The farmer raises his bent left arm vertically overhead,
               pointing upward with his raised left index finger.  He has short curly hair and wears shoes, stockings, breeches,
               and a shirt, or perhaps tights.  A string or ribbon ties the front of his shirt closed.  He may also wear a belt.
               The farmer's snug dwelling appears in the background, partially extending beyond the right edge of the design.

               from its door over the gentle, grass-covered hill on which it sits.  Two large trees stand atop this hill, their
               trunks side-by-side below the text panel.  Branches appear above the text panel, and above the branches appear
               the leafy canopies of the trees, which are difficult to distinguish from one another.  A smaller leafy tree with
               one visible branch grows to the left of the cottage.  A craggy mountain, or mountains, rise in the
               distance between the large trees and the cottage.  Wash in the background suggests the sky, perhaps with clouds.

Gray stands at the left side of the design, facing right but turning his head slightly
               forward.  His right leg is bent backwards and his right foot is on tiptoe.  His bent right arm is down by his side,
               and he holds a book in this hand.  His finger holds his place between its open pages.  He wears shoes and a long
               robe or gown with a wide collar, and he has short curly hair.  His eyes are lowered slightly.  The older man, who
               represents "some hoary-headed swain" (see the letterpress text), stands at the right side of the design and faces left, towards
               Gray.  He leans on a cane or walking stick, which he holds in his left hand; his left arm is straight down by
               his side.  His slightly bent right arm is raised at 45 degrees in front of him, and he points towards a humble
               grave between the men with his right index finger.  His head and eyes are slightly lowered, and his mouth is
               slightly open; he tells stories to the poet Gray about the man in the grave nearby.  He has long white hair beneath a wide-brimmed hat, and wears a long, wide-collared coat that reaches to
               his ankles.  His shoes and stockings are visible beneath the hem of the coat.  
               The nearest (and lowest) grave visible between Gray and the old man is a grassy mound crisscrossed with briars.  Above it appears a
               grander stone tomb monument.  A mountain or large hill rises from lower left to upper right corner of the design, in the background.
               Several rocky ledges suggest cliffs in the upper right corner especially.  A stream may run along the ledge
               second from top.  The graveyard and part of the mountain beyond is covered with grass.  A tree grows from the
               highest visible point of the mountain, its trunk curving to the left.  Branches that split off from the trunk
               bear clumps of leaves.  Grass covers the ground below it.  Nearer, just beyond the graves, a tree grows past
               the right side of the text box, its trunk splitting into thin bare branches near the upper right corner of the
               box and its leafy canopy spreading just above the box.  A second, smaller tree grows just to the left, its
               leaves partly hidden behind the text box.  Indeterminate leafy vegetation fills the middle distance at the right
               side of the design.  Wash around the trees and the figure of the poet suggests the sky streaked with thin clouds,
               and perhaps at sunrise or sunset.

               finger.  His head and eyes are slightly lowered, and his mouth is slightly open; he is telling the poet Gray about the man buried in the grave nearby.  He has long white hair beneath a
               wide-brimmed hat, and wears a long, wide-collared coat that reaches to his ankles.  His shoes and stockings are
               visible beneath the hem of the coat.  An ascot and perhaps a shirt show between the lapels of his coat; the
               cuff of his shirt is visible beneath the left cuff of his coat.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="object" location="CD"><characteristic>grave</characteristic><characteristic>tomb</characteristic><characteristic>mound</characteristic><characteristic>stone</characteristic><characteristic>grass</characteristic><characteristic>thorn</characteristic><characteristic>vine</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The nearest (and lower) grave visible between Gray and the old man is a grassy mound crisscrossed with vines.

               Three village women sit in the foreground under the branches of a large tree.  The woman on the left
               faces forward and slightly left.  She turns her head slightly to the right as if to speak to her neighbor.
               Her right arm is extended and raised at 135 degrees, and she points with her right index finger.  Her bent
               left arm lies down across her lap.  With this arm she supports a nude infant who seems to suckle at her left
               breast.  This child, who may be male or female, twists its torso to face away and raises both bent arms
               past its head.  It reclines into the crook of its mothers arm, its lower body facing up with its left leg bent
               back and drawn up, and its slightly bent right leg extended along the mother's open hand.  The woman is dressed
               in a long gown and wears a scarf over her long, loose curls.  The neckline of her gown is drawn down to allow
               her infant to nurse, partially exposing her left breast.  An older child, perhaps a boy, stands at her right
               knee.  This boy faces right and slightly forward.  His right arm is by his side but bent up.  He has short
               curly hair and seems to wear a gown.
               The woman in the middle sits facing right, though she tilts her head and turns it slightly to the left.  A
               young child stands on her lap.  This child, a girl, faces right and raises her slightly bent right arm in front
               of her at 135 degrees.  The girl holds a ball in this hand and seems to offer it to the rightmost woman.  The
               child wears a long gown and has long hair.  Her mother holds both bent arms in front of her, clasping her
               daughter loosely around the waist and legs with both hands.  The mother wears a long gown and has long, curly
               hair that seems to be drawn back to the nape of her neck.
               The rightmost woman is only partially visible at the edge of the design.  She faces forward but turns her head
               to look left.  Her right arm is by her side and bent up across her chest, palm raised and facing right.  Like
               her neighbors, she wears a long gown and has long curly hair.
               A fourth child stands at the knees of the rightmost woman and the woman in the middle.  This girl faces left
               and slightly away, so that she is seen partly from behind.  Her left arm is down but bent so that her lower
               left arm is hidden.  Her hair is long, and she wears a long gown.
               The women and children sit underneath a tall tree.  Its trunk grows up past the right side of the design.  A large
               limb splits off to the left near the top right corner of the design and arches over the text panel, bearing leaves
               at its tips.  Other, leafier limbs fill the spaces above and to the right of this arching limb.
               The ground on which the women sit is covered with grass.  A hedge or line of bushes or smaller trees crosses the design
               in the middle distance from the left edge to the tree trunk.  The ground behind rises as it nears the horizon, and slopes
               gently upward from left to right.  A grassy plateau appears in the distance, just
               below and to the left of the text panel.  At least four leafy trees appear in the mid-distance, near the edge of the design.
               Two mountain peaks rise on the horizon.
               A path or road appears at the base of the plateau in the middle distance.  A solemn funeral procession moves
               up the path to the right, the figures dressed in dark clothing.  Four pallbearers support a large coffin, draped with cloth, at the edge of the procession.
               Behind them, three couples walk in pairs, the women in long gowns.  Then an adult follows with
               two children, one on either side.  Finally, an adult brings up the end of the small parade.
               The spire of a church, presumably the destination of the funeral procession, is visible between the right side of the
               text panel and the tree trunk.  A smaller building, or group of buildings, is situated on the top of the plateau.
               Blue wash on either side of the tree trunk suggests the sky.  The upper right side of the trunk is in shadow;
               shadows also fill the spaces between the seated women.

               A large stone tomb monument stands on the ground below the text panel.  The ground beneath the tomb is covered with
               grass.  The trunks of at least two trees rise beyond the tombstone, at the left of the text panel.  Each trunk splits into
               multiple branches, which bear leaves above and to the left of the panel.  A "Shepherd" (see Blake's text, Object 106) stands on the tomb at the right side
               of the design.  He faces left and bows his head slightly.  His left arm is by his side, but bent up at the elbow to
               cross his chest; his left hand is not visible.  His staff rests on the ground, its crook in the crook of the shepherd's
               arm.  He wears a hat over his short, slightly curly hair, and a long gown or robe that parts to reveal his bare left foot.
               Wash surrounding the shepherd and text panel suggests the sky, perhaps with clouds.

The higher one appears to guide the lower as they ascend through the sky.
               One of the spirits flies or hovers to the left of the text panel, facing forward and slightly to the right.  His
               legs extend together slightly to the right; he also bends and twists his upper body slightly to the right and lowers
               his head.  Overall his body forms a gentle rightward curve.  His left leg is bent forward slightly.  One or
               both feet may be in tiptoe position.  He extends his right arm vertically overhead and points with the index finger of
               his raised right hand.  He reaches his left arm down at an angle a bit below 45 degrees with his palm facing
               out towards the spirit below.  He has short curly hair, and wears a transparent gown that drapes his figure
               gracefully and trails between his feet.  He seems to be looking down at the spirit beneath the text panel.
               The spirit below the text panel flies or hovers with body roughly horizontal, though curved up slightly at the waist.
               He faces forward but turns his head to look up to the left, so that his face is seen in three-quarters profile.  His 
               head is bent back and his eyes are raised to look at the spirit above.  Both arms are at his side, but bent forward
               at the elbow; both hands are raised with vertical palms facing out.  His right leg is extended but his left
               seems to be bent, or is otherwise hidden behind his right.  His right foot is in tiptoe position.  He has short curly
               hair and wears a diaphanous, semi-transparent gown.  The spirit on the left may be an angel; the spirit below may be a personification of the soul of a dead person.  Wash throughout the rest of the design, surrounding the two
