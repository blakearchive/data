    The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of thirty-three of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible.  All take their subjects from the New Testament and have been added to the twenty Old Testament subjects published in March 2010 as “Illustrations to the Bible, c. 1780-1824,” under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.  This new group is presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).
                <lb/><lb/>
                   Blake executed most of these New Testament water colors c. 1800-05 for his patron Thomas Butts.  The exceptions are <hi rend="i">The Whore of Babylon</hi> of 1809 and <hi rend="i">The Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins</hi> in the Yale Center for British Art, datable to c. 1825. The subjects range from the childhood of Jesus to his ascension, the later history of his parents and one of his major followers, St. Paul, and a group of eight designs based on the Book of Revelation.  While the illustrations of the life of Christ are fairly conventional in their subjects, in part because of the long tradition of picturing almost every event in the Gospels, individual motifs recall designs in Blake’s illuminated books and thus offer a window on Blake’s visual interpretation of the Bible. The illustrations of Revelation complement Blake’s intense engagement with apocalyptic events and images in his own poetry.
                    <lb/><lb/>
                        The selection of fifty-three biblical water colors now available in the Archive will be supplemented in the future with early works, such as <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>, datable to c. 1780, and will continue through Blake’s final biblical water colors, such as <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi>. 
                    <lb/><lb/>

On the left side is a gowned and winged male angel with long hair and a halo. He hovers, facing forward and to the right, looking at the three Maries. His right foot protrudes from beneath the hem of his gown. His right arm is raised at 45 degrees, palm out. His left arm is raised at 135 degrees and he points up with his left hand. His mouth is slightly open; he is probably speaking (see Mark 16:6). On the right side of the design stand three women with long gowns and veils or hoods over their hair. These are Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome according to Mark 16:1. The head of each woman is surrounded by a halo; their faces indicate surprise and perhaps fear. The leftmost figure has long hair and faces forward and right, perhaps looking at the angel with her mouth open. Her left arm is bent upward and she holds an urn, jar, or bottle. The middle figure has long, slightly curly hair. She faces forward and to the right, but looks left at the angel with her mouth open. Her right arm is bent upward and she holds an urn, jar, or bottle with it. The rightmost figure faces left, looking at the angel with her mouth open. Her left arm is bent upward and she holds an urn, jar, or bottle with a lid. The angel stands in an arched doorway in a stone wall of Christ' tomb. Another wall is behind the three Maries. The sky on the right upper corner of the design is cloudy, with a wash perhaps indicating sunrise or sunset. A hill or mountain is visible in the background. A building with spires or spiked towers and a wall extending to the left is visible in the background.
