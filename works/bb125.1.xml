                The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of electronic editions of two late copies of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi>, Copy V (Pierpont Morgan Library) and Copy Y (Metropolitan Museum), and a manuscript listing the order of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> (Rosenwald Collection, Library of Congress). Both copies are here reproduced for the first time, and, like all the illuminated books in the Archive, their texts and images are fully searchable and are supported by our Inote and ImageSizer applications.<lb/><lb/>
                Blake printed Copy V in 1821 in light orange ink on large sheets of J. Whatman paper watermarked 1818. He and/or possibly his wife, Catherine, drew four lines in pen and ink over or beside pencil lines to form a frame of three bands around each image; washed the frame's wide central band in light pinks, blues, yellows, or greens; and numbered the pages in ink 1-54 just outside the outer framing line. Copy Y, printed in 1825 in bright orange ink on J. Whatman paper watermarked 1825, is framed more decoratively with vines, curtains, and other motifs and is also numbered in pen and ink 1-54.<lb/><lb/>
                Both copies are connected either visually or bibliographically to Copy R, previously published in the Archive (see the update for 14 December 1999). Nearly all of the impressions of Copy R were printed in 1795 along with those making up Copy A (forthcoming in the Archive), and then, by August 1819, were refinished and given four framing lines for Blake's patron, John Linnell. Copy R established the plate order for seven of the eight subsequent copies printed between 1818 and 1827, including Copy Y and Copies Z and AA, both previously published in the Archive. The exception is Copy V, whose plates were uniquely arranged according to a manuscript entitled "The Order in which the Songs of Innocence &amp; Experience ought to be paged &amp; placed," often called "The Order of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>." Our reproduction of this manuscript is the first to be published since William Muir's partial facsimile of 1885, and our transcription and notes provide the most thorough textual and bibliographic treatment of it in any medium.<lb/><lb/>
                As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible through the continuing support of the Library of Congress, the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia, by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and by the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.

The recto is inscribed, in an unidentified hand, possibly George A. Smith's, as follows: "The following nine plates [inserted with the manuscript] are it is believed, engraved by Blake, tho' three only bear his name; and this Manuscript Index to the Song [sic] of Innocence and Experience is supposed to be in Blake's Autograph.  The engravings may be regarded as specimens of those 'daily tasks' alluded to in Cunningham's Memoir, by which the artist maintained himself, and purchased leisure for the indulgence of more favourite pursuits."</p></objnote><windowsize width="600" height="750"/></physdesc><phystext><vspace extent="1"/><lg type="prose"><l n="bb125.1.ms.01.01" justify="left" indent="10">The Order in which the Songs of Innocence &amp;</l></lg><vspace extent="1"/><lg type="prose"><l n="bb125.1.ms.01.02" justify="left" indent="4">of Experience ought to be paged &amp; placed</l></lg><vspace extent="1"/><lg type="prose"><l n="bb125.1.ms.01.03" justify="left" indent="10">Page</l><l n="bb125.1.ms.01.04" justify="left" indent="7">x<space extent="3"/>1<space extent="5"/>General Title<note>The two sequences of check marks and x marks preceding most of the numbered entries on both pages are written in a lighter ink than the rest of the manuscript and may have been written at a later date. These marks may be by Blake or by some other, unidentified writer. They may indicate alternative sequences for the plates, although no copy of *Songs of Innocence and of Experience* follows the left-hand series. The right-hand series (those closest to the numbers) corresponds to Copy F of *Songs of Innocence*, except that Copy F contains the second plate of "Night," number 23 in this manuscript. Copy F, however, was printed in 1789, long before Blake wrote this manuscript. Thus, the check marks may simply have been the writer's way of checking-off available impressions. There are as well very light diagonal strokes, rising from left to right and apparently in pen and ink, before many lines, most apparent on page 2 of the manuscript. These may be a continuation of the right-hand check marks or yet a third series of such marks. These very light strokes are not recorded in the transcription.</note></l><l n="bb125.1.ms.01.05" justify="left">✓<space extent="5"/>✓<space extent="2"/>2.<space extent="5"/>Frontispiece of Piper</l><l n="bb125.1.ms.01.06" justify="left">✓<space extent="5"/>✓<space extent="2"/>3.<space extent="5"/>Title page <subst><del type="overwrite">of</del><add type="overwrite" place="inline">to</add></subst> Songs of Innocence

The first letter of the line appears to be a "T" (overwritten by another "T"), followed by two illegible characters and what appear to be the letters "t" and "o."  The first of the illegible characters may or may not contain a vertical stroke.  The "h" overwriting this character may simply be comprised of two different shades of ink (as in the case of the aforementioned "L")-- and therefore the illegible character is almost entirely obscured by the lower half of the "h"-- or the "h" is merely a partial overwrite, in which Blake makes use of the vertical stroke of the underwritten letter, adding the lower element (namely, the portion of the letter appearing in darker ink).  The second illegibale character (overwritten by the letter "e") contains a vertical stroke.  Bentley reads this line as "27. [Little (*?*) *del*] The Little Boy Found" (*Writings*, volume 2, page 1320).  Erdman (page 772) and Keynes (*Letters*, page 144) read "27.
