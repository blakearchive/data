                  or more leaves may have been removed, at an unknown time prior to 1905, between
                  leaves 8 and 9 (Objects 16-17 as numbered here). The verso of leaf 9 (page B in
                  Bentley) and the recto of what is now leaf 10 (formerly leaf 16, page O in
                  Bentley) are blank. These blank pages are not reproduced here. Before rebinding in
                  1978, there were 6 blank leaves (Bentley pages C-N) of the same paper that bears
                  the manuscript between what are now leaves 9 and 10 (Objects 17-18 as numbered
                  here). As the sequence of watermarks and countermarks indicates, these blank
                  leaves were once conjugate with the manuscript. The verso of the final leaf
                  (Object 18 as numbered here and page P in Bentley) bears assorted drawings and
                  inscriptions. It is included in Butlin's catalogue (no. 149) as "The Lamb Lying
                  Down with the Lion and Other Drawings, from 'An Island in the Moon' Manuscript."

                     restored the original "cannot go to sleep" (page 850n). Phillips describes a
                     similar sequence, but notes that the original "go to" was overwritten by "get
                     to" and "till its dark" was added to the line (to read "and we cannot get to
                     sleep till its dark"). Phillips claims that Blake then restored the original
                     "go to" by a supralinear insertion and deleted "till its dark" (page 95n). See
                     note for line 4 for additional information about Blake's revisions to these

                     some adjustments in lines 2-3, and then recognizing "his mistake ... restored

                  several animals, a single bit of vegetation, and the profiles of two human faces.
                  Fragments of formal script not obviously connected to the sketches appear to
                  represent practice efforts at making various letters and letter sequences. In
                  addition, the word "Numeration" appears, along with a few whole and partial
                  signatures of William Blake. With one exception, the handwriting is located on the
                  left three quarters of the page. For further information on the text, see the
                  detailed transcriptions and editors' notes. Near the vertical midline of the page
                  are two human faces in left profile, one above the other. A pair of animals
                  recline near the top left corner. The larger animal may be a lion (with mane and
                  tail), the smaller one possibly a young horse or sheep. Below that pair of animals
                  lie a second pair in positions similar to the first — and with similar
                  forms. Thus the larger is perhaps a lion and the smaller a young sheep or horse.
                  The heads of the smaller animals in each of the two pairs seem similar to those in
                  two, possibly three, other sketches on the page: one below and slightly to the
                  right of the rear feet of the larger animal in the top pair, another to the right
                  of the heavily outlined horse's head in the lower right quadrant. The third
                  possibly related sketch is a left-facing sheep's(?) head in profile. It is located
                  just to the right of the pair of animals in the top left corner, among lines that
                  suggest clouds. There are elements of several horses — their bodies
                  and heads in various positions but all facing left — sketched down the right
                  side and across the bottom of the page. In addition to the six horses' heads and
                  the partial bodies, there are several wavy horizontal lines, some (perhaps all) of
                  which appear to be attempts at outlining aspects of the bodies of horses. In the
                  upper right quadrant of the page, a left-facing horse, its head partly obscured by
                  ink wash, rears on its hind legs. Between the extended front legs may be a small
                  flower or leaf. To the right of the head and neck of the rearing horse are the
                  profiles of a second and third horse's head, both facing left. Beneath the front
                  shoulders of the rearing horse are a fourth and a fifth horse's head, both again
                  in left profile. The fourth, nearest the rearing horse, is an obscure design
                  suggesting the head of a horse with a prominent eye. Just below the fourth horse's
                  head is a fifth. Two dark, curved lines extend to the right. The upper one may
                  suggest the front shoulder, back, and rear end of this (or perhaps another, or
                  perhaps no particular) horse. A lower line appears to extend from the bottom of
                  that horse's neck to the right and down. Left of the vertical centerline of the
                  page, near the bottom, to the left of the human face in profile, is a sixth
                  horse's head. And in the bottom left corner of the page are the headless torso and
                  hindquarters of a horse, facing left. </illusobjdesc><component type="animal" location="A"><characteristic>lion</characteristic><characteristic>horse</characteristic><characteristic>sheep</characteristic><characteristic>head</characteristic><characteristic>tail</characteristic><characteristic>mane</characteristic><characteristic>face</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>legs extended</characteristic><characteristic>leg extended backward</characteristic><characteristic>legs spread</characteristic><characteristic>legs drawn up</characteristic><characteristic>reclining</characteristic><characteristic>lying</characteristic><characteristic>anthropomorphic</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A pair of animals recline near the top left corner.

                     left (and possibly the suggestion of a right) hind leg extended backward. A
                     smaller animal, possibly a young horse or sheep, lies at the larger animal's
                     left side. It faces right while resting its head, facing away from the viewer,
                     upon the larger animal's back. Its front legs are extended; its hind legs are

                     lying against or beside it. The body of the larger animal faces left, its
                     sketchy head apparently facing forward, its front legs spread and extended
                     forward, its rear left leg extended slightly backward, with slight indications
                     of its rear right leg emerging alongside the smaller animal's front legs. The
                     larger animal appears to have a very long tail. The smaller animal, lying along
                     or against the larger animal's left side, faces right with its head possibly
                     resting on the larger animal's side. Its front right leg extends forward,
                     apparently bent at the knee; its back legs are drawn up underneath it.

                     an obscure design suggesting the head of a horse held at an angle of 45 degrees
                     and with a prominent eye. Just below the fourth horse's head is a fifth,
                     strongly outlined, positioned vertically with a few sketchy tufts of forelock
                     and its mouth slightly open. Two dark, curved lines extend to the right. The
                     upper one may suggest the front shoulder, back, and rear end of this (or
                     perhaps another) horse. A lower line appears to extend from the bottom of the
                     horse's neck to the right and down. </illusobjdesc></component><component type="animal" location="C"><characteristic>horse</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>mouth open</characteristic><characteristic>forelock</characteristic><characteristic>head down</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Left of the vertical centerline of the page, near the bottom, to the
