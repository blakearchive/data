                The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of fully searchable and scalable electronic editions of the following works related to Blake’s development of his illustrations to Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>: Preliminary Sketches for Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, listed under Drawings and Paintings, Pencil Sketches; Preliminary Drawings for Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, listed under Drawings and Paintings, Monochrome Wash Drawings; and Preliminary Illustrations to Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, listed under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.<lb/><lb/>
                In addition, we are republishing the following works, previously presented in our Preview mode, to make their designs fully searchable: Robert Blair, <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, the 1808 book listed under Commercial Book Illustrations, Designed by Blake and Engraved by Other Engravers; <hi rend="i">Deaths Door</hi>, listed under Separate Plates and Plates in Series, Designed and Engraved by Blake; and Illustrations to Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, the series of twenty finished designs, listed under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.<lb/><lb/>
                Taken together, these works in a variety of media present a comprehensive overview of one of Blake’s major projects as an illustrator and exemplify his working methods as he developed rough sketches into finished water colors.  The evolution of any one design can be traced via links presented under Related Works in the Archive on the pull-down menus, lower left on the main viewing page for each work. <lb/><lb/>
                In October 1805, Blake was commissioned by the engraver and would-be publisher Robert H. Cromek to prepare forty drawings illustrating Robert Blair's <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, a popular "Graveyard" school poem first published in 1743.  Cromek originally planned to select twenty of these designs for a deluxe edition of the poem.  Blake launched into the project with great enthusiasm, rapidly sketching out his illustrations in pencil, developing some into wash drawings, and then producing a group of more finished water colors for presentation to Cromek.  In a first prospectus of November 1805, Cromek names Blake as both the designer and engraver of fifteen designs.  Blake etched one image, <hi rend="i">Deaths Door</hi>, in white-line, but Cromek rejected it.  The dark power of the print appeals to modern tastes, but was far from fashionable in the early nineteenth century.  In a second prospectus, also of November 1805, Cromek announced that Louis Schiavonetti would engrave twelve designs for the new edition.  Blake had lost the potentially lucrative commission to engrave his own designs; his relationship with Cromek descended into anger and argument.  In spite of their disagreement, Cromek included a portrait of Blake as a frontispiece to the volume, published in 1808.  Cromek promoted the book aggressively and the illustrations to <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> became Blake's best known work through much of the nineteenth century. <lb/><lb/>

The branches are peeking over or growing from a horizontal line that may represent the top of a wall. The branches on the top right droop over a pair of closed doors. The doors arch to a point in Gothic style, and may represent the doors to a church or to heaven. Each door has a prominent keyhole. The doors are framed with slender spires. Topping the doors are at least six points and six small figures, three on each side of the door. The figures on the right face left and the figures on the left face right, and all stand with their hands together as though in prayer or supplication. These figures represent winged angels, wearing gowns, and may be small statues. The church or heavenly doors stand at the top of six stairs. To the left of the doors hovers a female figure, facing away and to the right. She may represent the soul rising to heaven. She may be partly clothed by a transparent gown draping from her waist. Her right leg is extending backward. Her long hair trails behind her as she looks to the right at the doors. Both of the figure's arms are raised at 45 degrees, and in each hand she holds a key topped by a design hinting at a fleur-de-lis pattern; presumably, the keys will open the doors to the right. Each of her hands is also pointing downward. At the bottom center of this leaf lies a supine body, covered in a shroud. This is likely a dead body, from which its soul rises. A slight aura of light surrounds her head. A trail of clouds rises to divide the soul and its body. Wash behind the body suggests a blue sky. </illusobjdesc><component type="vegetation" location="B"><characteristic>branch</characteristic><characteristic>leaf</characteristic><characteristic>willow</characteristic><illusobjdesc>In the top right of this design are drooping branches of a leafy plant, perhaps a willow tree. </illusobjdesc></component><component type="object" location="B"><characteristic>line</characteristic><characteristic>wall</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The branches on the top right of the leaf's design peek over or grow from a horizontal line that may represent the top of a wall. </illusobjdesc></component><component type="object" location="BD"><characteristic>door</characteristic><characteristic>Gothic art</characteristic><characteristic>arch</characteristic><characteristic>church</characteristic><characteristic>heaven</characteristic><characteristic>spire</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The branches on the top right of the leaf's design droop over a pair of closed doors.
