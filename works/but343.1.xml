            <updatestmt> 
             The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of a digital edition of Blake’s <hi rend="i">Eighteen Heads of Poets</hi>. These tempera paintings, produced by Blake between c. 1800 and 1803, were commissioned by William Hayley as decorations for his upper library at Turret House, his residence in Felpham, Sussex. In addition, we are publishing an exhibition curated by Mark Crosby that reconstructs Turret House and the upper library to show how Blake’s paintings were sequenced and hung. 
<lb/>
<lb/>
Blake had at least begun preliminary work on the <hi rend="i">Heads of Poets</hi> by the fall of 1800, as indicated by his letter to Hayley of 26 November: "Absorbed by the poets Milton, Homer, Camoens, Ercilla, Ariosto, and Spenser, whose physiognomies have been my delightful study…" (Erdman page 714). The sizes of the canvas panels, approximately 40.5 cm. high and of varying widths, were determined by their intended setting as a frieze between the bookcases and ceiling. The choice of authors to portray rested with Hayley.
<lb/>
<lb/>
In most of the eighteen paintings in the group, Blake included, right and left of the central portrait, either characters or events presented in the writer's works or emblematic motifs that allude to those works. The introductory essay and the Editors’ Notes to each painting indicate the probable sources for the portraits and the literary and pictorial references of the side motifs.

                    <objnote><p>This traditional depiction of the blind Greek poet (c. 950 B.C.) is probably based on Carlo Gregori's 1741 engraving of the Farnese bust of Homer after Giovanni Domenico Campiglia.  Blake may have also been influenced by the unsigned engraving of the Farnese bust published in Alexander Pope's translation of the *Iliad* (1720), a work Hayley owned, and by the small portrait on the title page of John Flaxman's outline illustrations to the *Iliad*, first published in 1793.  The mouse (left) and frog (right) allude to the *Batrachomyomachia*, a comedic battle between those creatures then attributed to Homer.  Their gestures suggest that these are the leaders of the two armies, the mouse Psikharpaks and the frog Physignathus.  Both Blake and Hayley are included in the list of subscribers to *The Iliad and Odyssey of Homer* translated by William Cowper (1791), a work that contains in its second volume a translation of the *Batrachomyomachia*.</p></objnote>

                            <illusobjdesc>In the center of the composition, the head and neck of a male
                                figure, Homer (c. 950 B.C.), is encircled by a vegetative wreath of intertwining leaves,
                                regularly interspersed with green, and likely new, berries. The wreath is
                                likely composed of the leaves and berries of a fruiting bay. This wreath
                                originates just right of center in the lower margin, and forms a tightly
                                bound circular shape which surrounds Homer's head and neck entirely.
                                Situated inside the wreath, Homer is depicted in the foreground of a
                                bronze-colored disc facing left. He is pictured with short, curly hair which
                                protrudes from a band or tight-fitting cap which encircles Homer's head
                                above his temples. His bearded face is depicted in the style of Greek
                                statuary so that the details of his eyes are not pictured. His eyes appear
                                under their lids as smooth spheres, possibly in recognition of Homer's
                                status as the blind poet. Fabric, likely a robe or some other clothing, is
                                visible on either side of the figure's neck, obscuring the figure's
                                shoulders. A band of cloth, probably also part of the figure's clothing, is
                                visible just under the base of the figure's neck. Several bay leaves
                                extend to the right and left of the wreath in the lower margin of the design.
                                Pictured in the lower margin to the left of the wreath is a mouse, probably
                                Psikharpaks, the mouse prince or "Crumb-thief," a character from
                                <hi rend="i">Batrachomyomachia</hi>, or <hi rend="i">The Battle of the Frogs and Mice</hi>, an epic parody
                                attributed to Homer. Psikharpaks is depicted with his head raised and
                                pointing to the left. His mouth is open so that teeth are visible. He may be
                                speaking or crying out. His snout, nose, and whiskers are all visible, as is
                                his left eye. His left ear is fully visible as is the edge of his right ear,
                                behind his head. Psikharpaks stands erect in an anthropomorphic stance on
                                his hind legs with hind legs spread and hind paws balanced on one of the bay
                                leaves in the attitude of a ferryman. His tail extends in a waving attitude
                                behind his back. Psikharpaks faces left with left foreleg and forepaw raised
                                and paw and claws spread. Psikharpaks's right foreleg is obscured by his
                                body, but his right forepaw holds a long staff or an oar with a long handle
                                which extends up beyond the figure's head. The oar's paddle appears to sink
                                into the lower margin of the image, suggesting that the leaf floats in
                                water. The leaf extends from the central wreath, and appears to be used as a
                                ferry or raft. Pictured in the lower margin to the right of the wreath is a
                                frog, probably Physignathus or the Frog King. Physignathus is depicted
                                facing right with his head raised, pointing up and to the right. His mouth
                                is open and he may be speaking or crying out. His right eye is visible.
                                Physignathus crouches in an anthropomorphic stance on his hind legs with his
                                hind legs bent and webbed hind feet balanced on one of the bay leaves.
                                Physignathus faces right with right foreleg raised and extending out and to
                                the right at 90 degrees. His right forefoot is spread with webbed toes
                                visible and extending or reaching out to the right. Physignathus's left
                                foreleg reaches up above his head and his left forefoot grasps a tall reed.
                                Two tall objects, possibly the trunks of palm trees or Grecian columns, are
                                depicted in both the left and right margins of the design. In the upper
                                corners of the design, vegetation, likely palm fronds, are depicted so that
                                the ends of the leaves or fronds point towards the central image of Homer in
                                the wreath. In the upper right margin, a lyre or harp is partially visible
                                so that part of the instrument's frame and strings are depicted. At least
                                one object is partially visible in the middle of the left margin of this
                                design. The object in the foreground in the left margin is probably a horn of
                                some kind. It has a curved shape and the base, which is pictured, indicates
                                that the horn is probably hollow. The curving shape which arches around this
                                hollow piece is likely the rest of the horn, but the full curl is not
                                visible on the design. In the background, just behind the horn, three tall,
                                thin objects extend towards the upper margin of the design. These may be
                                musical instruments like pipes or reeds, or they may be the pipes of a
                                tsampouna, a bagpipe commonly used in the Greek islands.</illusobjdesc>

                                    leaves. Situated inside the wreath, Homer is depicted in the foreground
                                    of a bronze-colored disc facing left. He is pictured with short, curly
                                    hair which protrudes from a band or tight-fitting cap which encircles
                                    Homer's head above his temples. His bearded face is depicted in the
                                    style of Greek statuary so that the details of his eyes are not
                                    pictured. His eyes appear under their lids as smooth spheres, possibly
                                    in recognition of Homer's status as the blind poet. Fabric, likely a
                                    robe or some other clothing, is visible on either side of the figure's
                                    neck, obscuring the figure's shoulders. A band of cloth, probably also
                                    part of the figure's clothing, is visible just under the base of the

                                    wreath is likely composed of the leaves and berries of a fruiting bay.
                                    This wreath originates just right of center in the lower margin, and
                                    forms a tightly bound circular shape which surrounds Homer's head and

                                        a mouse, probably Psikharpaks, the mouse prince or "Crumb-thief," a
                                        character from <hi rend="i">Batrachomyomachia</hi>, or <hi rend="i">The Battle of the Frogs and Mice</hi>,an epic parody attributed to Homer. Psikharpaks is depicted
                                        with his head raised and pointing to the left. His mouth is open so
                                        that teeth are visible. He may be speaking or crying out His snout,
                                        nose, and whiskers are all visible, as is his left eye. His left ear
                                        is fully visible as is the edge of his right ear, behind his head.
                                        Psikharpaks stands erect in an anthropomorphic stance on his
                                        hind legs with hind legs spread and hind paws balanced on one of the
                                        bay leaves in the attitude of a ferryman. His tail extends in a
                                        waving attitude behind his back. Psikharpaks faces left with left
                                        foreleg and forepaw raised and paw and claws spread. Psikharpaks's
                                        right foreleg is obscured by his body, but his right forepaw holds a
                                        long staff or an oar with a long handle which extends up beyond the
                                        figure's head. The oar's paddle appears to sink into the lower
                                        margin of the image, suggesting that the leaf floats in water. The
                                        leaf extends from the central wreath, and appears to be used as a
                                        ferry or raft. </illusobjdesc>

        <objnote><p>The portrait of the Greek orator Demosthenes (c. 383-322 B.C.) is based on an engraving signed by "D. Beyet" and dated 1789, in turn based on a full-length statue in the Vatican.  The motifs both right and left are taken from a drawing by William Hayley's son, Thomas Alphonso Hayley (see Object 18 for his portrait).  This design was engraved by Blake for Hayley's *An Essay on Sculpture* (1800), titled "The Death of Demosthenes."  The kneeling figure far left may be Archias, who discovered Demosthenes committing suicide.  The building on the left may be the Temple of Poseidon where the suicide took place.  Both portions of the side designs are painted to resemble sculpture, an art for which Thomas Alphonso was apprenticed to John Flaxman.</p></objnote>

                <illusobjdesc>In the center of the composition, the head and neck of a male
                    figure, Demosthenes (c. 383-322 B.C.), is encircled by a vegetative wreath of overlapping
                    leaves. The wreath is likely composed of oak leaves. This wreath originates
                    in the center of the design's lower margin where the stems of the oak leaves
                    are visibly intertwined. One of the intertwining stems may be a ribbon,
                    cord, or rope which helps the wreath form a circular shape surrounding
                    Demosthenes's head and neck entirely. Situated inside the wreath,
                    Demosthenes is pictured with short, curly hair and is facing left. His right
                    ear is visible. His bearded face is depicted in the style of Greek statuary
                    so that the details of his hair and eyes are not pictured in great detail.
                    His eyes appear under their lids as smooth spheres. Two figures are pictured
                    to the left of the wreath in the left margin of the design, though some of
                    the details of these figures are very lightly rendered making some of their
                    features barely visible. One reclining nude male figure faces right. The
                    figure may be Demosthenes in the act of committing suicide. The figure
                    gestures or appeals with his left arm which is raised at 45 degrees. His
                    left hand is outstretched with palm facing up and his thumb and two fingers
                    are visible. The figure's bearded face is pictured in profile with his head
                    tilting up and to the right. His right ear is visible, as is his short,
                    curly hair. Other details of his face are more difficult to see. The figure
                    rests on his right arm which is bent at the elbow with the forearm
                    supporting the figure's reclining torso, shoulders, and head. An
                    indeterminate object appears to be held in the figure's right fist--possibly
                    the reed filled with poison that Demosthenes used to kill himself. The
                    figure is mostly nude except for a single draped piece of cloth, clothing,
                    or drapery of some kind that hangs over the figure's left shoulder and
                    partially obscures the figure's upper body. His chest is mostly bare, as are
                    his genitals and legs. His legs are extended and point to the right. His
                    left leg is slightly bent at the knee so that his left thigh and knee are
                    visible, but his left foot is obscured by his extended right leg. His right
                    leg is fully extended so that his thigh, knee, shin and right foot are all
                    visible. Another figure, probably male, kneels behind the reclining nude
                    male. This may be Archias, who discovered Demosthenes in the act of suicide.
                    This figure, which is probably male, kneels on his right knee with his left
                    arm, leg, and knee obscured by the reclining figure. The kneeling figure is
                    clothed in a short, long-sleeved robe so that his right lower thigh, knee,
                    and upper calf are visible. The figure's upper body tilts forward so that he
                    may be supporting the reclining figure. His face is depicted in profile, and
                    he faces down and right. His shoulders and upper body are angled forward and
                    down over the recline figure. His clothed right arm is visible, but his hand
                    is obscured by the reclining figure. In the background behind both figures
                    is a building or structure with a smooth wall visible behind both figures.
                    This may be the Temple of Poseidon where Demosthenes committed suicide. The
                    structure appears to have a gable roof with one long ridge typical of
                    ancient Greek temples. The figures may be resting on a platform, plinth, or
                    step associated with the temple. This platform structure is obscured by the
                    central wreath, but is visible on both sides of the wreath. Three male
                    figures are pictured to the right of the design's central wreath, partially
                    obscured by the platform or step. Their rendering is light, so that some of
                    their features are indistinct. These figures may be Macedonian sentries or
                    soldiers sent to discover the fleeing Demosthenes. The figures are depicted
                    either climbing the plinth or step on which the dying Demosthenes is
                    pictured, or partially obscured by it so that each figure's lower legs
                    beneath their knees are not visible. Each figure is wearing protective
                    clothing or holds weapons or protective gear. All three are wearing
                    helmets. The figure to the far right of the design is pictured in profile
                    facing left. His upper body and arms are obscured by a large round, or
                    oval-shaped shield. His left upper thigh and buttock are visible, so that
                    the figure appears to be nude from the waist down or wearing tights. The
                    figure's right inner thigh is also visible, but, like the other figures, his
                    lower legs are obscured by a plinth or platform that he is standing on or
                    climbing. This figure also holds a spear or staff which is positioned
                    between the figure's face in profile and the shield he carries. To the right
                    of this figure stands another soldier. This figure faces left and wears a
                    plumed helmet with a chinstrap and a cloak or robe which obscures his body. He also
                    is depicted carrying or holding a spear or staff. Directly to the right of
                    the central wreath is another male figure pictured facing forward and also
                    wearing a plumed helmet with a chinstrap and protective clothing (possibly
                    a leather breastplate or light armor). His right arm is outstretched at 135
                    degrees, but is obscured by the central wreath below the elbow. He may be
                    wearing a cloak or some other type of draped fabric over his left shoulder,
                    but the details of the image are unclear. This figure is depicted in the
                    most active attitude of all three, with his right leg extended as though he
                    may be climbing the plinth.</illusobjdesc>

                            barely visible. Another figure, probably male, kneels behind the
                            reclining nude male. This may be Archias, who discovered Demosthenes
                            in the act of suicide. This figure, which is probably male, kneels
                            on his right knee with his left arm, leg, and knee obscured by the
                            reclining figure. The kneeling figure is clothed in a short,
                            long-sleeved robe or tunic so that his right lower thigh, knee, and
                            upper calf are visible. The figure's upper body tilts forward so
                            that he may be supporting the reclining figure. His face is depicted
                            in profile, and he faces down and right. His shoulders and upper
                            body are angled forward and down over the recline figure. His
                            clothed right arm is visible, but his hand is obscured by the
                            reclining figure. </illusobjdesc>

                            the figure appears to be nude from the waist down or wearing tights. The
                            figure's right inner thigh is also visible, but, like the other figures, his
                            lower legs are obscured by a plinth or platform that he is standing on or
                            climbing. This figure also holds a spear or staff which is positioned

                            a leather breastplate or light armor). His right arm is outstretched at 135
                            degrees, but is obscured by the central wreath below the elbow. He may be

                The portrait of Marcus Tullius Cicero (106-43 B.C.) is based on an engraving after a drawing by Peter Paul Rubens of a bust of the Roman orator.  One such engraving by M. Burg is the frontispiece in *Aeschines et Demosthenes de Corona*, ed. Petrus Foulkes and Johan Friend (1715), a copy of which was in Hayley’s library.  The designs right and left picture the death of Cicero at the hands of Roman soldiers.  His death is described in many publications, including at least one book in Hayley’s library, Conyers Middleton’s *The History of the Life of M. Tullius Cicero* (1741).

                    <illusobjdesc>In the center of the composition, the head and neck of a male
                        figure, Marcus Tullius Cicero (106-43 B.C.), is encircled by a vegetative wreath of
                        overlapping leaves. The wreath is likely composed of oak leaves, acorns, and
                        grain tassels. This wreath likely originates in the center of the design's lower
                        margin where the stems of the oak leaves are visibly intertwined. The wreath
                        forms a circular shape surrounding Marcus Tullius Cicero's head and neck
                        entirely. Situated inside the wreath, Marcus Tullius Cicero is pictured in
                        great detail, with short hair and is facing left. Cicero's right ear is visible.
                        On either side of his neck, clothing, possibly the traditional robe of a
                        Roman statesman, is visible. One prominent figure and a group of figures are
                        pictured to the left of the wreath in the left margin of the design, though
                        some of the details of these figures are very lightly rendered making some
                        of their features barely visible. One standing, bearded male figure faces
                        left with his left arm outstretched and left hand pointing towards the
                        design's central figure (Cicero's wreathed head). This figure may be the
                        centurion, or a Roman soldier following Mark Antony's orders to find and
                        capture Cicero, who was declared an enemy of the state following Caesar's
                        death. This figure is wears a striking red cloak, plumed helmet, armor,
                        knee-length tunic or skirt, and sandals in the typical costume of a Roman
                        soldier. The figure's right arm hangs by his side, and he may be holding a
                        sword in his right hand, though the details of this aspect of the figure are
                        unclear--the sword may belong to one of the soldiers behind him instead. The
                        figure's right leg is bent at the knee with his right foot clearly lifted in
                        the air, so that his left leg and foot support his body. The figure may be
                        in the act of moving or walking towards the center of the design. A group of
                        at least four (possibly more) Roman soldiers stand just behind and to the
                        left of the centurion. The details of three of these figures are very
                        difficult to distinguish, though it seems clear that all have similar
                        characteristics. These menacing figures all face left and all wear armor,
                        helmets, and sandals with legs bare below the knee. The foremost soldier in
                        this group of figures is pictured with his right arm bent at the elbow, and
                        grasping a spear or staff in his right hand, the base of which rests on the
                        ground. The figure directly behind and to the right of this soldier figure
                        may carry a shield, though the details are not clear. The point of at least
                        one more spear or staff is visible over the heads of this group of soldiers.
                        Behind this group of soldiers, light washes of blue and orange coloring
                        suggest a landscape or a seascape which is barely visible. Under the
                        centurion's outstretched right arm and pointing hand, the trunks and
                        branches of at least two trees are visible, probably meant to indicate the
                        forest through which Cicero attempted to flee Mark Antony's men toward the
                        port of Gaeta. At the top of the left margin some vegetation is pictured in
                        the foreground of the design. These may be palm fronds or another type of
                        indeterminate vegetation. To the right of the central wreath, a Roman
                        soldier with the red cloak and red plumed helmet stands facing away. His
                        right arm is raised above his head, with a sword grasped in his right fist.
                        This soldier is in the act of beheading another figure. His left arm is bent
                        at the elbow so that his left hand holds a scabbard behind his back. He is
                        also wearing the armor and sandals of a Roman soldier, and may be the same
                        figure, the centurion, pictured in the left margin of the design. Directly
                        behind this figure is another figure who may be Cicero in the act of being
                        executed by beheading. This figure is depicted bending or leaning forward
                        and facing right, with his bare head and neck prominently visible, and
                        situated leaning over the long arm of a structure or vehicle of some sort
                        (probably the litter, or Lectica, from which he is said to have leaned out
                        of as a surrender to his execution). The lectica is depicted with long arms
                        for Cicero's slaves to support the structure both in front and behind the
                        conveyance. The Lectica is pictured with a platform and seat for a rider to
                        rest in, and a curtained cover or roof with cloth drapery is also visible in
                        this image. To the left of the executioner, a figure in a tunic is pictured
                        standing between the arms of the lectica. This figure faces left, with his
                        head bent and face covered. He is likely male, and appears to be wearing a
                        short tunic and sandals. He is likely one of Cicero's slaves, hiding his
                        face as Cicero is executed. In the top right of the design, some
                        indeterminate vegetation is visible just below the right corner of the
                        design. In the central space, and at the top right of the design is pictured a
                        nude male figure who appears to preside over the execution of Cicero. This
                        is likely Hermes, as the figure is represented holding a long staff around
                        which two snakes are intertwined. Hermes holds this staff with his left arm
                        and hand. The details of this figure are difficult to distinguish, but he
                        may be pictured with a winged helmet, and winged sandals.</illusobjdesc>

                            left with his left arm outstretched and left hand pointing towards the
                            design's central figure (Cicero's wreathed head). This figure may be the
                            centurion, or a Roman soldier following Mark Antony's orders to find and
                            capture Cicero, who was declared an enemy of the state following
                            Caesar's death. This figure is wears a striking red cloak, plumed
                            helmet, armor, knee-length tunic or skirt, and sandals in the typical
                            costume of a Roman soldier. The figure's right arm hangs by his side,
                            and he may be holding a sword in his right hand, though the details of
                            this aspect of the figure are unclear--the sword may belong to one of
                            the soldiers behind him instead. The figure's right leg is bent at the
                            knee with his right foot clearly lifted in the air, so that his left leg
                            and foot support his body. The figure may be in the act of moving or
                            walking towards the center of the design.</illusobjdesc>

                            right arm bent at the elbow, and grasping a spear or staff in his right
                            hand, the base of which rests on the ground. The figure directly behind
                            and to the right of this soldier figure may carry a shield, though the
                            details are not clear. The point of at least one more spear or staff is

            <p>
                The portrait of the Italian poet Dante Alighieri (1265-1321) is taken from his portrayal in Raphael’s *Disputation of the Holy Sacrament*, probably known to Blake through one of many engravings of the fresco in the Vatican.  The chain (left) and the seated man with four children (right) picture the story of Ugolino in Dante’s “Inferno” in his *Divine Comedy*.  Blake illustrated the Ugolino narrative several times, first in a pencil sketch datable to c. 1780-85 (Butlin 207 recto), later in *The Marriage of Heaven and Hell* plate 16, in his Dante illustrations of 1824-27 (Butlin 812.68), and a tempera painting of c. 1826 (Butlin 805).  None of these versions is compositionally similar to the design accompanying this head of Dante.  Blake may have acquired his copy of Henry Boyd’s translation of *The Inferno* (1785) from Hayley as early as 1800 (see Bentley page 686, no. 721).

                    <illusobjdesc>The head and neck of a male figure, Dante Alighieri (1265-1321), encircled by
                        a vegetative wreath of overlapping leaves and fruit is pictured centrally in
                        this design. The wreath is likely composed of bay leaves and bay berries.
                        This wreath likely originates in the center of the design's lower margin
                        where the stems of two bay branches are visibly overlapping. The wreath
                        forms a circular shape surrounding Dante's head, neck, and right
                        shoulder entirely. Situated inside the wreath, Dante is pictured
                        in great detail, with short, curling hair visible peeking from a cloth head
                        covering, or a hood, and he is facing left, looking over his right shoulder. 
                        In addition to a cloth head covering, the figure is pictured with a
                        vegetative wreath or crown, likely composed of laurel leaves, which rests on
                        top of his headdress, crossing his forehead and the crown of his head. This
                        crown arches in the same direction as the wreath of bay leaves, so that it
                        appears to add foliage to the wreath. His right shoulder is visible and is
                        clothed in drapery, a cloak, or a robe of some kind. At the top margin of
                        the design, some clusters of diagonal lines in both upper corners of the
                        design might represent indeterminate vegetation, or an indeterminate or
                        abstract design of some kind. In the left margin of the design, an abstract
                        design of indeterminate foliage is visible to the far left of the central
                        wreath and across the upper left margin of the design. The rectangular shapes
                        of four large stones or bricks are also visible in the lower left margin of
                        the design, suggesting the presence of a stone wall or stone steps. A chain
                        appears to be fastened to one of these stones or bricks. One large circular
                        link is attached to the stone, with several links of the metal chain curving
                        down and towards the central wreath, eventually disappearing behind the
                        central wreath's foliage. This chain and the stone wall suggest the interior
                        of a prison, which is further evidenced by the scene in the right margin of
                        the design. In it, an adult male figure (Ugolino, a character in Dante's
                        "Inferno" in his <hi rend="i">Divine Comedy</hi>) is pictured seated and facing left with his face in profile. The
                        scene is pictured against a stone wall and under a stone archway or doorway,
                        and the chain pictured in the left margin of the design reappears and is
                        visibly fastened to the figure's left wrist, and extends down his left side.
                        Ugolino is depicted wearing a robe or gown of some kind, with short curly
                        hair and a curly beard which falls at least to his chest. His wrists are
                        manacled, and his hands are crossed in his lap with his right hand covering
                        his left. His robe obscures his legs, however they may be crossed, and what
                        appear to be his bare feet are visible at the hem of his robe. A child is
                        seated on his lap (one of his sons), and the child's right arm wraps around
                        his father's torso. The boy faces out, but looks up towards his father's
                        face. The boy has short, curly hair and his shoulders and chest are visible,
                        clothed in some sort of tunic or drapery, however, his lower body is
                        obscured by his father's body. Another child, another of Ugolino's sons,
                        appears to be standing behind his father's legs, and rests his head against
                        the back of Ugolino's open right hand. This child's right shoulder and face
                        are visible, but the rest of his body is obscured by his father's legs. He,
                        too, looks upwards towards his father's face, though his physical appearance
                        is not rendered in great detail. Two more figures are pictured in the
                        foreground of this scene, at Ugolino's feet. One figure is seated in the far
                        right corner of the design, with the other figure stretched out in front of
                        the seated figure. This seated figure is of indeterminate gender. They may
                        be a young woman, or a young man in a long robe. This figure has short,
                        curly hair, and faces left, with their face and eyes looking down at the
                        figure stretched out across their lap and on the ground in front of them.
                        The seated figure leans slightly forward, and supports the outstretched
                        figure's head and shoulders as they rest in their lap. The seated figure's
                        legs are obscured by the long robe that they wear, and their arms are
                        partially obscured by the figure resting on them. The outstretched figure
                        appears to be another child, likely one of Ugolino's dying or dead sons. The
                        child's upper body and torso lean against the seated figure behind him while
                        his legs stretch out towards the design's central wreath. The child's head is
                        bent back and resting limply on the seated figure's left forearm, and his
                        eyes and mouth appear to be open. He is pictured in profile, with his left
                        arm hanging limply by his side, and left leg is visible extended. Both his
                        feet are visible, and appear to be bare. The child may be clothed in
                        tight-fitting tights or clothes, or may be nude. At Ugolino's feet, a small
                        round object may be a weight or link attached to the figure's chain, or may
                        be an indeterminate object. Abstract, swirling designs in the right margin
                        of the design may be palm fronds or abstract designs.(</illusobjdesc>

                The portrait of the English poet Geoffrey Chaucer (c. 1340s-1400) is probably based on an engraving by George Vertue published in John Urry’s 1721 edition of the *Works of Geoffrey Chaucer*.  A copy of the book was in Hayley’s library.  One detail, however, suggests that Blake may have consulted other Chaucer portraits engraved by Vertue, one dated 1730 and included in his series of “Twelve Celebrated English Poets” and another published in 1737 and 1740 editions of *The Canterbury Tales*.  These two, like Blake’s version, show three buttons on Chaucer’s gown rather than the two buttons in the plate published with Urry’s text.  Blake pictures the Merchant left of the central portrait and the Wife of Bath on the right, both from *The Canterbury Tales*.  These are closely based on engraved headpieces, unsigned but attributable to Vertue, on pages 66 and 76 in Urry’s edition of Chaucer’s *Works*.

                In the center of the composition, the bust of a male figure, Geoffrey Chaucer, is encircled by a vegetative wreath of intertwined stems and flame-like leaves, probably a fruiting laurel wreath. The laurel originates in the center of the lower margin and forms a circular shape which surrounds the bust entirely. Two indistinct, decorative objects, which may be palm fronds or feathers, extend upward from the middle of the left and right margins to the top corners. Situated inside the wreath, Chaucer faces left and looks downward, perhaps toward the small figure to his left. His mouth is closed but he may be smiling. He has a bare forehead, with some hair visible above his right ear, thin eyebrows, and well-defined eye lashes. His tunic or shirt has a high collar and at least three top buttons. In the lower two corners of the image, pictured outside the laurel wreath, are two figures on horseback. These are the Merchant on the left and the Wife of Bath on the right, both from Chaucer's <hi rend="i">Canterbury Tales</hi>. The Merchant faces right. He appears to wear a hat or helmet. His right leg extends forward to rest in a stirrup, and his right hand grasps a bridle. The horse faces right and is likely trotting or walking. Also on horseback, the Wife of Bath rides side-saddle and faces forward and left. She wears a hat and a veil or drapery, perhaps a wimple, that covers her shoulder and neck. The rider's horse faces left with its front left leg raised off the ground.

                    . She faces forward and to the left. She wears a pointed hat or helmet and, beneath it, drapery or a veil which may be a wimple that covers her neck and shoulders. She wears a robe and rides side-saddle, and bends her left arm to hold the reins with at least one hand. Her right leg appears to be bent at the knee, so that her legs are spread slightly as she sits.

                    The portrait of the Portuguese poet Luis Vaz de Cam&#245;es (or Camoens, 1524?-80) is based on the frontispiece engraving in Camoens’ epic, *The Lusiads*, translated by Richard Fanshaw (1655), a copy of which was in Hayley’s library.  The ship and anchor left of the portrait allude to Vasco de Gama’s voyage to India, one of the subjects of *The Lusiads*.

                        overlapping leaves of what may be palm, and a vine with smaller leaves which
                        wraps around the broader palm leaves which make up the majority of the

                        distinguishable as any specific type of vegetation. Situated inside the
                        wreath, Camoens is depicted in the foreground facing right. He is
                        pictured with short, curly hair, a mustache, and beard. His left ear is
                        visible, and his left eye is pictured as open and looking out towards the
                        viewer. His right eye is closed, probably to depict Camoens was blind in his

                        indeterminate vegetation, or may indicate waves, foam, or sea spray. In the
                        lower right corner of the design, a sharp, pointed object appears to extend
                        from behind the vegetation of the central wreath. This may be a harpoon or
                        some other kind of hook or weapon. Blue washes in the right margin of the

                    The portrait of Alonso de Ercilla y Z&#250;&#241;iga (1533-94) is based on the engraved bust of the Spanish poet by Manuel Salvador Carmona published in the second volume of Juan Jos&#233; L&#243;pez de Sedano’s *Parnaso espa&#241;ol* (1770).  Hayley owned a copy of seven of the nine volumes of the 1768-78 edition of Sedano’s book.  Hayley’s references to it in his *Essay on Epic Poetry* (1782) indicate that the Sedano volumes were very probably in his library by 1800.  The arrows (left) and feathered bonnet (right) allude to Ercilla’s epic poem about the wars between the Spaniards and Indians in Chile.

                    <illusobjdesc>The entirety of this design is composed of the head and neck of a
                        male figure, Alonso de Ercilla y Z&#250;&#241;iga (1533-94), who is depicted in profile facing right,
                        and encircled by a vegetative wreath of overlapping leaves. The wreath is
                        composed of two obviously different sets of foliage. One variety of foliage
                        appears with long, thin leaves--these may be palm fronds, grass stems, or
                        another indeterminate vegetation. Another variety, mixed less abundantly
                        into the longer leaves, are smaller, broader leaves with clear stems
                        visible, possibly bay leaves. This wreath likely originates in the center of
                        the design's lower margin where the two sides of the wreath's vegetative
                        bunches overlap. These overlapping bundles of vegetation appear to be bound
                        by intertwining ribbons, rope, or strips of cloth which drape through to the
                        right side of the design. The wreath forms a circular shape surrounding
                        Ercilla's head and neck entirely. Situated inside the wreath,
                        Ercilla is pictured in profile in great detail, with short,
                        curling hair and he is facing right. Ercilla's right ear is visible, and his face
                        is bearded. Ercilla is depicted wearing a metallic collar and ruff,
                        possibly parts of military attire. Folds of fabric or another ruffle of some
                        kind is visible below the metallic collar and may be another piece of
                        clothing: a robe, tunic, cloak, or another type of military dress. A band or
                        circlet with feathers attached by their shafts may be a feathered headdress
                        or crown pictured in the lower right corner of the design, in the foreground,
                        in front of the wreath. Peeking out from behind the wreath in the lower left
                        corner of the design are an arrowhead and the fletching, the feathered end,
                        of another arrow. In the upper right margin, the long stalks of grass or
                        another indeterminate vegetation is depicted growing vertically outside the
                        central wreath, with the tips of these stalks bending in towards the central
                        wreath. Some waving lines in the upper left margin of the design may also be
                        vegetation--stalks of grass or flame-like leaves of some
                        kind.</illusobjdesc>

                            right, and encircled by a vegetative wreath of overlapping leaves.
                            Situated inside the wreath, Ercilla is pictured in profile in
                            great detail, with short, curling hair and he is facing right. His right
                            ear is visible, and his face is bearded. Ercilla is depicted
                            wearing a metallic collar and ruff, possibly parts of military attire.
                            Folds of fabric or another ruffle of some kind is visible below the

                            right, and encircled by a vegetative wreath of overlapping leaves. The
                            wreath is composed of two obviously different sets of foliage. One
                            variety of foliage appears with long, thin leaves--these may be palm
                            fronds, grass stems, or another indeterminate vegetation. Another
                            variety, mixed less abundantly into the longer leaves, are smaller,
                            broader leaves with clear stems visible, possibly bay leaves. This
                            wreath originates in the center of the design's lower margin where the
                            two sides of the wreath's vegetative, bundled branches overlap. The
                            wreath forms a circular shape surrounding Ercilla's head and

            <objnote><p>The portrait of the Italian poet Torquato Tasso (1544-95) is based on the engraving by N. Depuis after Enoch Seeman published as the frontispiece in Jacob Tonson's two volume edition of Tasso's *Gierusalemme Liberata* (1724).  A copy of this work was in Hayley's Library.  The angels right and left and the back view of a woman on the left probably allude to the liberation of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre that concludes Tasso's chief work, *Gierusalemme liberata*.  Hayley's library included two translations of the epic.  A lost drawing of the Sepulchre by William Hayley's son, Thomas Alphonso Hayley, might be the source for Blake's design.  The drawing is known only through references to it in Thomas Hayley's letter of 11 January 1796 to William Hayley and letters by William Hayley of 11 and 14 January 1796 to his son Thomas.</p></objnote>

                    <illusobjdesc>In the center of the composition, the head and neck of a male
                        figure, Torquato Tasso (1544-95), is encircled by a vegetative wreath of long, thin,
                        overlapping leaves or stems of grass. The wreath is likely composed of
                        grass, palm fronds, or another indeterminate, flame-like vegetation. This
                        wreath seems to be one, continuous circle without an origin point--unlike
                        other heads of poets designs, this wreath does not have obviously overlapping
                        branches or stems. Situated inside the wreath, Tasso is pictured as
                        balding with some short, curly hair and is facing and looking left. Tasso's left
                        ear is visible. His face is bearded, and he is wearing a cloth collar. Two
                        figures are pictured to the left of the wreath. One kneeling, winged, robed
                        female figure is pictured in profile with shoulder-length hair and faces
                        right with her right arm and hand outstretched. She is pictured as bending
                        forward and to the right and may be praying, supplicating, or communicating
                        with the other figures in this scene. She may be an angel, a saint, or
                        another Christian holy figure. Facing away from the viewer, seen from
                        behind, another kneeling female figure is pictured with her arms lifted and
                        bent at the elbows, and, although her hands are obscured by her head, they
                        are likely positioned on her head or covering her face in some way. This
                        figure is pictured wearing a long cloth veil or a shroud and long gown or
                        robe with a train or long skirt. She faces the arched opening of what is
                        likely a tomb or building and kneels on what appears to be a stone step at its entrance. This scene likely represents the Virgin visiting the tomb.
                        Above and in the background of the opening of the structure, the pointed
                        tops of several tall shrubs or trees, or another flame-like vegetation, are
                        visible. In the top left margin of the design, and in the corner of the lower
                        left of the design, several sweeping green masses seem to indicate
                        indeterminate vegetation of some kind, possibly moss or grass. To the right
                        of the central wreath, the tomb's arched opening continues, as does the step
                        or platform which appears to the left of the wreath. Another winged figure,
                        also pictured in profile and facing left, kneels to the right of the wreath,
                        with left arm and hand outstretched and right arm resting on the figure's
                        right thigh. This figure leans forward slightly, and appears to have long
                        hair and may be robed. It is not clear whether this figure is male or
                        female. Above the cavern opening to the right of the wreath, the pointed
                        tops of several tall shrubs or trees, or another flame-like vegetation, are
                        visible. In the top corners of the design, several arching branches, possibly
                        of willow trees, arch inwards towards the center of the design. Some dark,
                        indeterminate vegetation (perhaps moss) obscures the step in the bottom
                        right corner of the design. In the lower left margin of the design, a dark
                        wash may indicate lapping water creeping up the steps of the structure, or
                        may be vegetation. </illusobjdesc>

                                kneeling female figure is pictured with her arms lifted and bent at

                                are likely positioned on her head or covering her face in some way.
                                This figure is pictured wearing a long cloth veil or a shroud and
                                long gown or robe with a train or long skirt. She faces the arched
                                opening of what may be a tomb or building, and kneels on what appears
                                to be a stone step at its entrance. This figure may be

                <p>
                    The portrait of the English poet Edmund Spenser (c. 1552-99) is probably based on George Vertue’s engraving of 1727 among his series of “Twelve Celebrated English Poets.”  The medal hanging from Spenser’s collar, inscribed “ELIZA[BETH],” does not appear in the print and is presumably Blake’s addition.  The designs left and right of the portrait are probably allusions to Spenser’s poem, *The Shepherd’s Calendar*, particularly the April eclogue.  The aged figure holding a staff on the right may be Hobbinol from the poem; the crowned woman sitting far left may be Queen Elizabeth, described in the eclogue as “a mayden Queene” wearing a “cremosin coronet.”

                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>In the center of the composition, the head and neck of a male
                        figure, Edmund Spenser (c. 1552-99), is encircled by a vegetative wreath. The wreath is
                        likely composed of two individual branches of olives and olive leaves. This
                        wreath originates in the center of the design's lower margin. Situated inside
                        the wreath, Spenser is pictured with short, curly hair, a mustache, and a
                        beard. Spenser is facing left. His right earlobe is visible. Spenser is wearing
                        an intricate collar with a lace border. The patterned cloth just beneath
                        this collar could indicate a coat. Also visible under the figure's collar is
                        a large disc with the image of a woman wearing a ruff, a bodice, and a
                        skirt. The disc may be a pendant or medal of some kind, and the woman
                        represented on it may be Queen Elizabeth I. Encircling the central figure
                        and wreath are a group of figures, nymphs, with clasped hands who appear to fly or
                        float in misty clouds or wind. Stars and a dark wash indicate these
                        figures are positioned in the night sky. Three figures are pictured with
                        clasped hands on the left side of the design. In the top left margin of the
                        design, a figure, who is probably female, faces right, and is depicted flying
                        or floating with her right arm outstretched. Her right hand grasps the hand
                        of the figure pictured right and below her. She appears to be gowned, and
                        has long hair. This figure's body is depicted in shadow so that many details
                        about her person are obscured. Another female figure flies or floats below
                        and to the right. She faces out and towards the viewer. Both her arms are
                        outstretched, with her left arm reaching out and back to the figure behind
                        her and her right arm reaching down towards the figure below. Her left hand
                        grasps the hand of figure behind. Her right hand touches the wrist of the
                        figure below. This middle figure has curly, long hair. She appears to be
                        loosely draped in cloth or fabric, and section of which appears to be blown
                        by the wind or the movement of the figures so that it covers her breasts and
                        trails upwards. The clouds, mist, or wind in which the figures fly obscures
                        the details of this figure's body and legs. A third female figure is
                        pictured below this middle figure. She faces right. Her left arm is
                        outstretched and reaches down. Her right arm reaches back so that her right
                        hand touches the right wrist of the middle figure. The third figure has long
                        curly hair and wears a band of cloth or a circlet of some kind in her hair,
                        which is blown back by the wind or the movement of the figures. She appears
                        to be gowned or wrapped in cloth or fabric which covers her body and blows
                        back and up towards the middle figure. These figures form a semi-circle which
                        curves around the left side of the design's central wreath. They appear to
                        fly or float in sweeping clouds which form flame-like shapes in the lower
                        margin of the design. One star is visible in the left margin of the design.
                        Another celestial body, a crescent moon, is pictured in the lower left
                        corner of the design. Crouching in the curve of this crescent moon, and
                        pictured leaning back against the moon, is a female figure wearing a
                        long gown. This figure looks right, her hair is short and curly, styled
                        similarly to Queen Elizabeth I's. The similarity is further emphasized by
                        the figure's clothing; she wears a large, lacy ruff collar and a crown.
                        This figure's left arm is bent at the
                        elbow with her forearm pointing upwards, her hand mostly closed, and index
                        finger pointing upwards, perhaps gesturing towards something, or providing a
                        warning. The figure's right arm is bent at the elbow, and the details of her
                        right hand are somewhat difficult to make out. However, her right hand may
                        be spread open on her lap. Both her legs are covered by her long gown, but
                        they are clearly bent at the knees with her lower legs tucked underneath
                        her. She may be resting on the heels of her feet as she crouches on the
                        moon. Encircling the wreath in the right margin are another pair of flying
                        or floating figures in wispy clouds or wind. The uppermost figure appears to
                        be female, whose curly hair appears to be pulled back into a bun. She faces
                        down, but her upper body is twisted out and to the right. Her left arm
                        reaches up with her hand outstretched. Her right arm reaches down and her
                        right hand reaches towards the figure below her, though it is not clear that
                        their hands touch. This upper figure wears a gown or is draped in cloth
                        which floats around her and obscures her lower body. A lower figure to the
                        right of the central wreath is seen from behind. She reaches up towards the
                        figure above her with her right arm and her right hand outstretched. Her
                        left arm stretches to the left, with her left hand gracefully posed. Her
                        face appears to look up towards the figure above her. Her long curly hair
                        drifts out to the left and may be arranged in a braid. She may be nude, and
                        draped in cloth or fabric which covers her right shoulder and drapes around
                        her lower body and legs, which are positioned to the figure's left. Four
                        stars are visible in the right margin of the design, one of which appears as
                        part of the central wreath, and three appear in the dark wash suggesting a
                        night sky in the upper right margin of the design. A robed male figure
                        appears to the far right of the central wreath and flying figures. He stands
                        facing left and down. He has long hair and a beard. His face is depicted in
                        profile so that his left eye, which is shown as a distinctive dark black
                        mark, is visible to the viewer. His right arm is bent at the elbow, and his
                        right forearm and hand appear to rest on his chest. His left arm is extended
                        down at his left side and his left hand holds a long staff which may mark
                        him as a shepherd. The figure's long
                        robes obscure his legs and feet. This figure may be a representation of Spenser
                    himself as a shepherd-poet serving Queen Elizabeth, or he may be Hobbinol, a character in Spenser's 
                    <hi rend="i">The Shepherd's Calendar</hi>, from which the other figures in this design are likely derived.</illusobjdesc>

                            pictured with short, curly hair, a mustache, and a beard. He is facing

                                similarly to Queen Elizabeth I's. The similarity is further emphasized by

                                appears to the far right of the central wreath and flying figures. He stands
                                facing left and down. He has long hair and a beard. His face is depicted in
                                profile so that his left eye, which is shown as a distinctive dark black
                                mark, is visible to the viewer. His right arm is bent at the elbow, and his
                                right forearm and hand appear to rest on his chest. His left arm is extended
                                down at his left side and his left hand holds a long staff which may mark
                                him as a shepherd. The figure's long
                                robes obscure his legs and feet. This figure may be a representation of Spenser
                                himself as a shepherd-poet serving Queen Elizabeth, or may be Hobbinol, a character in Spenser's

                    The portrait of the English poet and playwright William Shakespeare (1564-1616) is based on the famous engraving by Martin Droeshout, first published as the frontispiece in *Mr. William Shakespeares Comedies, Histories, &#38; Tragedies*, 1623.  Both of the side designs, possibly based on a lost drawing by William Hayley’s son, Thomas Alfonso Hayley, illustrate act 4, scene 1, in *Macbeth*, with the three witches and Macbeth on the right and Banquo’s ghost on the left, pointing to the first in the line of kings.  The lost drawing is known only through references to it in William Hayley’s *Memoirs*, not published until 1823, and John Flaxman’s letter to William Hayley of 5 July 1799.  Blake’s pencil sketch of c. 1785, *Macbeth and the Ghost of Banquo*, is a different composition based on a different scene in the play.

                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>In the center of the composition, the head and neck of a male
                        figure, William Shakespeare (1564-1616), is encircled by a leafy vine which forms a wreath shape
                        as it grows on a structure that arches over the figure's head. This
                        wreath-like shape appears to be composed of country plants, possibly
                        including a morning glory vine with leaves and at least three morning glory
                        blossoms pictured to the left of the figure. Another variety of flowering
                        plant may be intertwined with the vine in the lower margin of the design as
                        some small flowers or buds appear to be growing among the morning glory
                        leaves and blossoms. However, this vegetation is indeterminate. Situated
                        inside the wreath, Shakespeare is pictured as balding, with hair growing
                        around the crown of his head and at his temples. His portrait is based on the 
                        famous engraving by Martin Droeshout. Shakespeare's face is depicted in
                        detail, with both eyes and eyebrows visible. He is pictured with a short
                        mustache and a tuft of hair that grows just below his lower lip. Shakespeare
                        wears a large, broad collar which mostly obscures the other clothing he
                        wears--though it may be the collar of a coat. Two figures are pictured to
                        the left of the central figure of Shakespeare. One figure, probably Banquo's ghost from Shakespeare's play, <hi rend="i">Macbeth</hi> is male and stands looking back over his left shoulder with both arms
                        reaching left and hands outstretched, towards the second figure. Banquo may
                        be gesturing or pointing toward this figure, or reaching towards it. Banquo
                        wears a full suit of armor and a helmet. He appears to be walking towards
                        the second figure, striding with his left leg extended back and his weight
                        distributed between his right leg and the ball of his left foot. The second
                        figure appears situated behind Banquo's outstretched arms. This figure may
                        be the first in the line of kings conjured up by Banquo. It is depicted as faceless with a what appears to be
                        a long hooded cloak or robe enshrouding him, and obscuring his body
                        entirely. A series of triangular points on top of this figure's head is
                        likely a crown. A tree appears to grow in the far left margin of the design,
                        with branches and needle-like leaves arching towards the design's central
                        figure. Pictured to the right of the central wreath are four figures. In the
                        foreground, a male figure in full armor and wearing a helmet (likely
                        Macbeth) stands with his legs wide apart and his upper body leaning to the
                        right. The figure's mouth appears to be open in terror, and his arms seem to
                        ward off the other three figures he is pictured with. His left arm is raised
                        and bent at the elbow, with his left forearm raised in front of his face,
                        his hand and fingers spread, and left palm facing away from his face.
                        Macbeth's right arm is also raised, but is pictured lower. His right palm is
                        facing towards the other figures in the scene as though to ward them off or
                        protect himself. Behind Macbeth, and pictured as seated crouching, or
                        kneeling in a group are three female figures who are likely witches. They
                        each wear a cloth head covering, possibly wimples, and appear to be gowned.
                        They each look up and to the right, towards Macbeth. The female figure
                        pictured to the far right has both hands on her face, and her forearms are
                        visible with her elbows propped on her gowned knees. The female figure at
                        the far left of this group is pictured in profile and appears to be
                        frowning. She seems to be kneeling, and her arms may be crossed in front of
                        her, or she may be holding something that obscures her arms, or her arms may
                        be hidden under her clothing. The female figure in the middle of the group
                        is almost entirely obscured by the other two figures. Just her face and
                        covered head are visible. At the feet of this four-person group are the
                        flames of a fire, suggesting that the three witches sit by a bonfire when
                        Macbeth encounters them. In the top right margin of the design, several
                        arching diagonal lines suggest vegetation, likely palm fronds and other
                        indeterminate vegetation. </illusobjdesc>

                            In the foreground, a male figure in full armor and wearing a helmet
                            (likely Macbeth) stands with his legs wide apart and his upper body
                            leaning to the right. The figure's mouth appears to be open in terror,
                            and his arms seem to ward off the other three figures he is pictured
                            with. His left arm is raised and bent at the elbow, with his left
                            forearm raised in front of his face, his hand and fingers spread, and
                            left palm facing away from his face. Macbeth's right arm is also raised,
                            but is pictured lower. His right palm is facing towards the other
                            figures in the scene as though to ward them off or protect
                            himself.</illusobjdesc>

                            They each look up and to the right, towards Macbeth. The female figure
                            pictured to the far right has both hands on her face, and her forearms
                            are visible with her elbows propped on her gowned knees. The female
                            figure at the far left of this group is pictured in profile and appears
                            to be frowning. She seems to be kneeling, and her arms may be crossed in
                            front of her, or she may be holding something that obscures her arms, or
                            her arms may be hidden under her clothing. The female figure in the
                            middle of the group is almost entirely obscured by the other two
                            figures. Just her face and covered head are visible. </illusobjdesc>

                    Milton.  The portrait of the English poet John Milton (1608-74) is probably based on the engraving by Giovanni Battista Cipriani of a bust of Milton, derived from William Faithorne’s engraving of Milton and published in *Memoirs of Thomas Hollis* (1780).  Cipriani pictures Milton with irises turned upward and barely represented, as though clouded with the blindness that afflicted the poet in his later years.  Blake follows Cipriani’s rendering of Milton’s eyes, whereas Faithorne’s engraving presents a sighted Milton.  Blake probably became familiar with the Hollis volume because Blake’s engraving master, James Basire, engraved ten of its thirty-seven plates, some probably executed during Blake’s term of apprenticeship.  Henry Crabb Robinson, in his conversations with Blake, and Samuel Palmer in a letter of 1879 to George Richmond, noted Blake’s interest in the portraits of Milton in Hollis’s *Memoirs* (see Bentley, *Records*, pages 428-29).  The snake, both right and left of the central portrait, and the fruit in his mouth refer to Satan in his serpent form and the fall of Eve in Milton’s *Paradise Lost*.  The harp (left) and musical pipes (right) allude to Milton as a writer of both epics and pastoral poems.

                    <illusobjdesc>In the center of the composition, the head and neck of a male
                        figure, John Milton (1608-74), is encircled by a vegetative wreath of overlapping
                        leaves. The wreath is composed of intertwining branches of several types of
                        vegetation and fruit, including bay leaves, bay berries, oak
                        leaves, acorns, and one large fruit attached to a leafy, twining stem which
                        may be an apple. This wreath originates in the center of the design's lower
                        margin where the wreath's two sections seem to overlap and may be connected
                        by what looks like a wide ribbon or swath of cloth. Situated inside the
                        wreath, Milton is pictured with long, shoulder-length curling hair and
                        is facing left. Milton's face is depicted in the style of Greek statuary so that
                        his eyes appear under their lids as smooth spheres, possibly depicting the blindness
                        which afflicted Milton in his later years.
                        Milton is pictured wearing a wide, folded
                        collar with a patterned neck cloth or kerchief partially visible and
                        protruding from under this large collar. Above the wreath, several arching
                        branches of vegetation, probably palm fronds, extend towards the central
                        wreath. Below the wreath, a large, scaly serpent winds its way around the
                        lower margin of the design. The serpent's head and upper half of its scaly
                        body are visible to the left of the wreath. The serpent's head and upper
                        body twists over itself so that it forms a single loop and its head faces
                        right with mouth open. Small teeth are visible. A round object, probably a
                        fruit like an apple, is pictured in the serpent's mouth. Its right eye is
                        visible, and the scales on the serpent's head form flame-like spikes at the
                        base of the head. The lower half of the serpent's scaly body and long tail
                        are pictured to the right of the wreath, with the tail twisting over itself
                        and forming a loop so that the tip of the serpent's tail points in towards
                        the center of the design. In the left margin of the design is a harp decorated with what may be an angel.
                        To the right of the wreath in the right margin of the design, the trunk of a
                        palm tree is visible. Three pipe-like objects are also visible in the right
                        margin of the design. These may be the pipes of an instrument like organ pipes or the pipes of a large
                        bagpipe.</illusobjdesc>

                <p>
                    The portrait of the English poet John Dryden (1631-1700) is based on George Vertue’s engraving after Godfrey Kneller’s painting first published in Dryden’s *Dramatic Works* (1717).  Hayley owned a copy of the 1735 edition, also containing the engraving.  The scene on the left illustrates the opening lines of Dryden’s poem, *Alexander’s Feast or the Power of Music*.  The man is Alexander; the woman is the courtesan Thais.

                    <illusobjdesc>Located centrally in this design are the head and neck of a male
                        figure, John Dryden (1631-1700), encircled by a vegetative wreath of overlapping leaves.
                        The leaves of this wreath are not highly distinctive, however the wreath is
                        likely composed of bay or laurel leaves and stems. This wreath likely originates in
                        the center of the design's lower margin where the stems of two sage branches
                        are visibly overlapping. The wreath forms a circular shape surrounding John
                        Dryden's head, neck, and right shoulder entirely. Situated inside the
                        wreath, John Dryden is pictured in great detail, with short, wavy hair. He
                        faces right, but his face is turned so that he looks over his right
                        shoulder with his eyes pointing to the left. Both his eyes are visible, as
                        is his right earlobe. Under Dryden's chin and jaw, the folds of a cloth
                        shirt collar and the fabric of a shirt are visible. His clothed right
                        shoulder is visible. To the left of the central wreath, a scene with two
                        figures is lightly rendered, and illustrates the opening lines of 
                        Dryden's poem, <hi rend="i">Alexander's Feast or the Power of Music</hi>. In the foreground, a nude male figure, Alexander, is seated
                        on what may be a bench or the seat of a litter or chariot. His upper body
                        faces out towards the viewer, but his legs are situated so that they face
                        right. This figure's face is pictured in profile, and he looks back to his
                        left towards the figure seated next to him. He has short hair, and a
                        vegetative crown of leaves and fruit (possibly figs and fig leaves) resting
                        on his head. The figure's nude torso faces out towards the viewer. His right
                        arm is bent at the elbow, and right hand rests on the arm of the bench on
                        which he sits. His right leg is bent at the knee and his lower leg is
                        extended with his bare foot visible. His left leg is bent at the knee with
                        his lower leg bent under the bench and resting on the balls of his left
                        foot. A piece of cloth or fabric drapery is arranged over the figure's lap
                        and covers his upper thighs and drapes over his right hip. The figure may be
                        gently holding this fabric with the tips of his fingers on his right hand.
                        Sitting next to, and partially obscured by, the male figure is a female
                        figure, Thais, who is also seated. She is loosely draped in a gown, fabric, or
                        drapery of some kind which reveals her right shoulder and breast. Like her
                        companion, her upper body faces outwards to the viewer. Her face is also
                        turned outwards, and her eyes look up and to the right. She may also have a
                        headdress of some kind on, though the details are quite faint. Her left arm
                        is bent at the elbow, which rests on her left knee. She rests her head in
                        her left hand. Her bent legs are covered by her long gown. At her feet, a
                        round object is pictured, though it is not clear what this object is. The
                        feet of the male figure rest on a step or plinth, or the raised platform of
                        a litter or chariot. The right side of this structure is visible, and forms
                        the arm of the bench on which the two figures sit. This right side appears
                        to be adorned by two crossed thin rectangular shapes which form an "x."
                        These may be straps or bands designed to help transport or carry the litter.
                        Above the bench are swooping shapes which may represent curtains or a canopy
                        made of cloth. In the top left margin of the design, the branches and
                        needle-like leaves of what may be palm trees appear. In the lower left
                        corner of the design, several small shadows may represent the folds of
                        curtains, or may be some indeterminate vegetation. The space to the right of
                        the central wreath is largely vacant of any design. The exception is that
                        the knees, calves, and right foot of a human figure are very faintly visible
                        in the lower right margin. The scale of these limbs indicate that the figure
                        to whom they belong was likely quite large. However, any other details of
                        this figure are not visible.</illusobjdesc>

                The portrait of the English dramatist Thomas Otway (1652-85) is derived from Jacobus Houbraken’s engraving of Mary Beale’s painting first published in Thomas Birch’s *Heads of Illustrious Persons of Great Britain* (1741).  A re-engraving of this portrait by John Miller appears in the 1757 edition of Otway’s Works owned by Hayley.  The scene on the right pictures Jaffier threatening to kill his wife, Belvidera, in Otway’s play, *Venice Preserved*.  Venice is pictured on the left.

                    <illusobjdesc>Located centrally in this design are the head and neck of a male
                        figure, English dramatist Thomas Otway (1652-1685), encircled by a
                        vegetative wreath of overlapping leaves. The leaves of this wreath are not
                        highly distinctive, however the wreath is likely composed of sedge and
                        grasses. This wreath likely originates in the center of the design's lower
                        margin where two branches are visibly overlapping. The wreath forms a
                        circular shape surrounding John Otway's head and neck. Situated inside the
                        wreath, Thomas Otway is pictured in great detail, with shoulder-length, wavy
                        hair. He faces forward, and rests his right cheek on the backs of his
                        fingers of his closed right hand. His right pinky is the only finger that is
                        visible, the others appear to be closed in his hand. His right wrist is
                        visible, as is the cuff of his right shirt sleeve. Both his eyes are
                        visible, as is his right earlobe. Under Otway's chin and jaw, the folds of a
                        cloth collar and the fabric of a shirt are visible. To the left of the central wreath, a city surrounded by water is
                        visible, pictured under a night sky. This is Venice, the location of Otway's play, <hi rend="i">Venice Preserved</hi>. Green wash in the lower left margin
                        appears to be the bank beside a body of water. Just beyond it, a section of
                        blue represents a short stretch of water, with at least one boat floating
                        down it. A mark just above the boat could be a figure rowing or steering the
                        boat. A stone bridge arches from the bank across the water to the walls of
                        the city beyond. At least six conical or pointed spires are visible beyond
                        the city walls. The roofs of several buildings indicate several structures
                        within the walls. One dome may represent a cathedral or another large
                        structure. In the wash of blue above the city, a sickle
                        moon indicates a night sky. In the far left margin of the design, in the
                        foreground of this landscape, there is a brushy shrub or another
                        indeterminate vegetation. In the upper left corner and in the upper left
                        margin of the design, arching leaves grow upward and curve in towards the
                        design's central wreath. These appear to be palm fronds. Two figures are
                        pictured in the lower right margin of the design. A male figure stands with
                        his legs bent at the knee and braced. He appears to be wearing a shirt; a
                        collar is pictured clearly at the base of his neck. However, his muscled
                        legs do not appear to be clothed, perhaps he is wearing tights which cover
                        his thighs. He appears to have short, curly hair, and he faces right and
                        looks down at the second figure who kneels at his feet. His left leg is
                        positioned forward so that he appears to be lunging forward with his right
                        leg bearing his weight. His right arm is raised, and he appears to hold a
                        dagger in his clenched right fist, in the act of stabbing the figure at his
                        feet. His left arm reaches out and grasps the second figure, though it is
                        not clear how he holds her--he may be clutching the figure's neck. A long,
                        pointed object is pictured behind the figure's left leg and may be a
                        scabbard or a sword. The second, female figure kneels in the foreground. She
                        is pictured from behind, and faces right, looking up at the face of man who
                        stands above her. Her hair is long and she wears a long dress or gown that
                        obscures her legs, which appear to be bent at the knee as she kneels. Her
                        left arm reaches up and is bent at the elbow to protect herself or plead
                        with her assailant. She may be grasping the man's hand or forearm. Her head
                        is bent back and she looks up towards the knife held over her. These figures
                        are intended to represent Jaffier stabbing Belvidera in Otway's play, <hi
                            rend="i">Venice Preserved</hi>. A dark mass in the far right margin
                        could be another shrub or another indeterminate vegetation. Diagonal lines
                        in the upper right margin could be palm fronds or some other indeterminate
                        vegetation. </illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>Two figures are pictured in the lower right margin of the
                            design. A male figure stands with his legs bent at the knee and braced.
                            He appears to be wearing a shirt; a collar is pictured clearly at the
                            base of his neck. However, his muscled legs do not appear to be clothed,
                            perhaps he is wearing tights which cover his thighs. He appears to have
                            short, curly hair, and he faces right and looks down at the second
                            figure who kneels at his feet. His left leg is positioned forward so
                            that he appears to be lunging forward with his right leg bearing his
                            weight. His right arm is raised, and he appears to hold a dagger in his
                            clenched right fist, in the act of stabbing the figure at his feet. His
                            left arm reaches out and grasps the second figure, though it is not
                            clear how he holds her--he may be clutching the figure's neck. A long,
                            pointed object is pictured behind the figure's left leg and may be a
                            scabbard or a sword. This figure is likely Jaffier, a character in Otway's play, <hi rend="i">Venice Preserved</hi>. </illusobjdesc>

                            stands above her. Her hair is long and she wears a long dress or gown
                            that obscures her legs, which appear to be bent at the knee as she
                            kneels. Her left arm reaches up and is bent at the elbow to protect
                            herself or plead with her assailant. She may be grasping the man's hand
                            or forearm. Her head is bent back and she looks up towards the knife
                            held over her. These figures are intended to represent Jaffier stabbing

            <objnote><p>The portrait of the English poet Alexander Pope (1688-1744) is based on one or more of the numerous engravings of the painting by Jean-Baptiste van Loo, probably known to Blake through the engraving by Jacobus Houbraken in Thomas Birch's *Heads of Illustrious Persons of Great Britain* (1741) or the plate signed "Cook" or "Sharp" and dated 1778 in John Bell's edition of *The Poets of Great Britain*.  Hayley owned a copy of Bell's edition.  The woman holding a sword and dagger on the left is based on the opening of Pope's "Elegy to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady."  The lady praying on the right is Eloisa from Pope's "Eloisa to Abelard."  Both poems are printed in the 1797 edition of Pope's *Works*, a copy of which was in Hayley's library.</p></objnote>

                    <illusobjdesc>The composition depicts a bust of the poet Alexander Pope
                        (1688-1744) surrounded by a wreath. The wreath
                        seems to be made of several kinds of plant that overlap and intertwine. On
                        the left side of the vine is multiple branches of what might be laurel,
                        though it is possible that there are two kinds of foliage from trees
                        present. On the right side of the wreath are at least two different types of
                        vines. One might be ivy, and the central vine with thicker leaves might be a
                        kind of fern, but it is indeterminate. At the center of the wreath is Pope,
                        who is male. He has a prominent forehead and long, curly hair that might be
                        a wig. His head is bent slightly back, resting against his hand with his
                        fingers spread. His eyes are raised, facing right and up. He might be
                        smiling. His clothing is only sketched, likely a coat and necktie, cravat,
                        or piece of cloth around his neck with a shirt. On the right side of the
                        composition is a female figure kneeling and praying. Her head is bent back,
                        her eyes are raised and her hands are together with her arms bent upward.
                        Her hair is covered by a long hood, and she is also wearing a gown. The
                        figure might be inside a church or chapel based on the shape of the windows
                        above her. There are three windows, all arched in the style of Gothic Art.
                        The central window has a candle or lamp inside it. Because the walls of the
                        room curve, the ceiling might be domed. This scene might be based on Pope's
                        "Eloisa to Abelard," and the female figure is Eloisa. The left side of the
                        composition is another female figure, dressed in a similar fashion of a hood
                        that covers her head and a long gown. She is standing and facing forward
                        with an expression of what might be melancholy. She is holding a sword and
                        dagger, and is based on the opening of Pope’s “Elegy to the Memory of an
                        Unfortunate Lady.” In the background there are three cypress trees, with one partially obscured   by the wreath. In the sky is a crescent moon. The vegetation at the top corners of the painting are likely palm trees.</illusobjdesc>

            <objnote><p>The portrait of the French writer Fran&#231;ois Marie Arouet de Voltaire (1694-1778) is based on the painting by Maurice Quentin de Latour of c. 1731, well known through several engravings such as those by Jean Baptiste Gu&#233;lard (c. 1735) and Pierre Gabriel Langlois (1785).  Joan of Arc on the left challenges the soldiers on the right, probably an allusion to Voltaire's unfinished satirical poem, *La Pucelle de Orl&#233;ans* (begun 1730 but not published until 1762).</p></objnote>

                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>In the center of the composition, the head and neck of a male
                        figure, Francois-Marie Arouet de Voltaire (1694-1778), is encircled by a
                        complicated, colorful vegetative wreath of overlapping leaves, fruit, and
                        flowers. The wreath appears to be composed of a grape vine with curling
                        tendrils, at least two separate bunches of grapes and grape leaves, and a
                        variety of flowers with stems and leaves which may include honeysuckle,
                        convolvulus, and pimpernel. Other vegetation is also pictured, but is
                        indeterminate. These flora are arranged in a loose circular shape around
                        Voltaire's head and neck, but unlike other heads of poets designs, the flora
                        in this design is not a arranged in a tightly-constructed wreath. It is not
                        bound by any tie or ribbon. Situated inside the wreath, Voltaire is pictured with long, shoulder-length, curly hair in the
                        style of an intricate wig and is facing left. His face is depicted in
                        detail, with both eyes and eyebrows visible. His nose is distinctively
                        rendered as quite large and protruding. Voltaire is pictured wearing a cloth
                        cravat which wraps around his neck and also includes a large ruffle which is
                        mostly obscured by the wreath that encircles the figure. The collar of a
                        coat or waistcoat is barely visible, and a mass of whirls on the figure's
                        left shoulder may be a ruffle on his coat, or part of his curling hair. One female figure, Joan of
                        Arc, is pictured to the left of the wreath in the left margin of the design,
                        though some of the details of this figure are very lightly rendered making
                        some of her features barely visible. This figure stands looking right with
                        her left arm raised vertically and her left hand grasping a sword. Her right
                        arm hangs by her side and is strapped into what appears to be a shield. The
                        figure wears a plumed helmet and what appears to be a closely fitting bodice
                        or a breastplate of armor. She is pictured with long hair and wears a long
                        gown. Her right foot is visible, and appears to be covered in a slipper or
                        insubstantial shoe of some kind. Also in the lower left margin of the design
                        is a mass of curved lines and one dark shadow with some colorful streaks
                        overlaying this design. It is unclear what this may be, though it could be
                        the flames of a fire. A group of three male figures are pictured to the
                        right of the design's central wreath. Their rendering is light, so that some
                        of their features are indistinct. These figures are dressed in armor, and
                        each appears to be wearing a helmet with a plume or crest and each is
                        carrying a shield, a sword, and a spear. Each soldier appears to march or
                        stride forward towards the female figure on the left side of the design. Each
                        of their bearded faces look left. The points of four spears are visible
                        above this group, suggesting that the three soldiers visible are followed by
                        more who are not pictured. Across the top margin of the design,
                        several arching diagonal lines suggest vegetation, likely palm fronds or
                        indeterminate vegetation.</illusobjdesc>

                    The portrait of the German poet Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock (1724-1803) is modelled on a mezzotint by Johann Gerhard Huck after a painting by Anton Hickel.  On 14 Oct. 1800, Hayley’s friend William Meyer sent him a copy of this print (see Butlin 343.16).  Both flanking vignettes may be incomplete or damaged, the one on the left showing only thorny brambles.  The angel (note the shadowy wings) on the right holds a quill in her right hand.  The figure might have been prompted by a passage in Klopstock’s poem “Siona,” included in the 1798 edition of his works in six volumes in Hayley’s library.

                        German poet Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock (1724-1803). His portrait is encircled by a vegetative wreath of two
                        different plants the blend together at two points in the center, lower and
                        upper, of the wreath. The plant on the left of the wreath is pine, based on
                        its densely packed pine needles that grow from thin branches. The plant that
                        makes up the right of the wreath may be non-flowering reed or grass because
                        of the flat, pointed edge of its leaf. Situated inside the wreath, Klopstock
                        faces left and looks upward, possibly towards descending leaves or fronds
                        the appear at the upper left edge of the painting. His mouth is closed. He
                        has large eyes and thin eyebrows, his forehead is bare due to the hair on
                        his head being pulled back or the style of his wig. There are curls on
                        either side of his head that partially cover his ears. He appears to be
                        wearing a cravat around his neck, a waistcoat, and an outer coat. Both
                        flanking vignettes may be incomplete or damaged. On the right side of the wreath is
                        another figure, who due to the wings on her back appears to be an angel. She
                        appears female, with her head is bent back as she faces left, eyes towards
                        Klopstock. She has long, curly hair. She kneels beside the wreath and wears
                        a long gown, while her arms are raised, with her right bent horizontally at
                        the elbow, as though playing a harp. Her left is bent upward. Her visible
                        hand is holding a quill. At the far lower left of the painting are long,
                        white streaks that might be rib bones. The ground of the painting to the
                        left of the wreath is covered in thorny brambles or vines.</illusobjdesc>

                    The portrait of Hayley’s friend, the English poet William Cowper (1731-1800), reproduces the pastel drawn by George Romney in 1792.  In addition to this version among the Heads of Poets, Blake executed five other copies of Romney’s work: a pen and ink drawing and a pencil sketch, both datable to c. 1801 (Butlin 351-52), two water color miniatures datable to c. 1801 and c. 1801-04 (Butlin 353-54), and an engraving published in William Hayley’s *The Life, and Posthumous Writings, of William Cowper*, vol. 1 (1803).  No textual sources have been found for the side vignettes. The dog (left) might be Beau, Cowper’s spaniel; the boy (right) might be Hayley’s son, Thomas Alphonso Hayley.

                    <illusobjdesc>In the center of the composition, the bust of a male figure,
                        William Cowper (1731-1800), is encircled by a vegetative wreath of what
                        appears to be a single type of plant. In contrast to thicker wreaths in the
                        series, this one appears to be a single or two branches intertwined with
                        thin leaves, likely olive based on the shape of the leaf and the fruit shown
                        on the right side of the wreath. In the center of the wreath is Cowper, who
                        is wearing a hat that is likely a night cap that covers his ears and hair.
                        Cowper is wearing a high collar coat and a
                        cravat tied into a bow around his neck. He is facing right, looking towards
                        the other figure on the right of the wreath. The figure on the right of the
                        composition is young and male, who appears to be running. His arms are
                        raised vertically, and he holds an open book in his right hand. He has
                        short, curly hair with his eyes raised. The boy is wearing an open collar
                        shirt and breeches. He might be Hayley's son, Thomas Alphonso Hayley. On the
                        left side of the wreath is a dog, who appears to be walking or pointing with
                        its head while its leg is drawn up, like during a hunt. The dog might be
                        Beau, Cowper's spaniel. Framing the composition are two trees on either
                        side, with the one on the left fully visible. Based on the curve of their
                        branches, these are likely willow trees.</illusobjdesc>

                <p>
                    The portrait of William Hayley’s son (1781-1800) is based on a drawing by Henry Howard copying a medallion by John Flaxman.  Blake’s engraving of the medallion portrait was published in William Hayley’s *Essay on Sculpture* (1800).  An untraced work by Blake, *Thomas Alphonso Hayley, Profile Drawing* (Butlin 344), datable to 1800, may have been a preliminary for the painting in the Heads of Poets series.  The inclusion of “Tom” Hayley with eminent writers implies that the group of portraits was intended in part as a memorial to Hayley’s illegitimate son, dead at the age of nineteen.

                    <illusobjdesc>The main part of the composition it the bust of a male figure, Thomas Alphonso Hayley (1781-1800), William Hayley's son. In the portrait he is young, facing forward with only one side
                        of his face visible. He has short hair that partially covers his ear, and he
                        is wearing an open collar shirt. The wreath around his bust is simple: based
                        on the shape of the leaves, it looks to be made of ivy vines. The painting
                        is old and the materials appear to be fading, but the bottom left and right
                        of the wreath show two doves, their wings raised in flight, while their
                        beaks are grabbing at parts of the wreath.</illusobjdesc>
