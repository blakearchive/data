She appears to be nude except for the gown or cloak draping her legs. Her left hand is holding a book open while pointing to the book’s text. Two nude figures, perhaps a female (left of Enitharmon/Hecate) and a male (right) are behind Enitharmon/Hecate. The female faces right, the male to the left. Their hair is visible, but not their faces. An ass enters from the left and munches on some foliage in the lower left corner of the design. Behind the donkey is a rocky terrain, perhaps the side of a cliff or hill. Nestled within the rocks is a peeking lizard (?) revealing only its head. Behind the lizard and farther up on the rocks is an owl. In the distance on the right, an anthropomorphic bat flies above the heads of the three figures. Even farther in the distance, along the right margin, an outline of another flying creature appears.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="BD"><characteristic>Hecate</characteristic><characteristic>Enitharmon</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>cloak</characteristic><characteristic>drapery</characteristic><characteristic>hem</characteristic><characteristic>partly nude</characteristic><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>legs drawn up</characteristic><characteristic>legs crossed</characteristic><characteristic>feet</characteristic><characteristic>hand</characteristic><characteristic>partly nude</characteristic><characteristic>arms at side</characteristic><characteristic>touching</characteristic><characteristic>pointing</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>spiral</characteristic><characteristic>fingers spread</characteristic><characteristic>sitting</characteristic><characteristic>knees</characteristic><illusobjdesc> Hecate (or Enitharmon) is pictured sitting on the ground with her legs drawn up and her left leg crossed in front of her right.  She appears to be wearing a dark gown or cloak that only covers her legs.  Both knees are prominent and her feet are prominent at the gown’s hem; her shoulders and arms are bare.  She has long hair and she looks to the left, while her left hand is touching an open book. A curling lock of hair suggests a spiral.  Her left index finger points to the book’s text.  Her arms are at her sides and her gown obscures her right hand.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>young</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>arm at side</characteristic><characteristic>arm behind back</characteristic><characteristic>buttocks</characteristic><characteristic>kneeling</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent at knee</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>hand</characteristic><characteristic>right foot</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A nude and youthful female (?) kneels to the left of Enitharmon (or Hecate).
