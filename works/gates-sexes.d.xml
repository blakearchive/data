<hi rend="i">moir</hi> effect, in the display of several images when
viewed through either the
ImageSizer window or in the Inote Panner.
These effects are not present in the non-Java inline displays of the same
images, nor in their enlargements, nor in Inote itself.
The distortion, we believe, is a product
of the geometric compression of the image by the ImageSizer and Panner.
We anticipate resolving this issue in the future, but we
have elected to publish this edition as is since the
integrity of the image data is not at stake—only its representation
according to some of the Archive's display mechanisms. Users who wish to
verify the accuracy of a given impression are advised to examine either its
enlargement or the non-Java inline version of the same image.</note></publicationstmt><seriesstmt>The William Blake Archive</seriesstmt><updatestmt>
            The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of new electronic editions for two works in Blake's emblem series: <hi rend="i">For Children: The Gates of Paradise</hi> and the revised and augmented version For the <hi rend="i">Sexes: The Gates of Paradise</hi>. Through a numbered series of intaglio plates with inscriptions ranging from single words to brief aphorisms, Blake puts the course of human life from birth to death in psychological perspective. Some of the emblems form narrative sequences; others exemplify mental states and their reification in the external world. Blake etched in intaglio the eighteen plates of <hi rend="i">For Children</hi> in 1793 and printed all extant copies (A-E) in the same year. The copy published in the Archive is Copy D, from the Rosenwald Collection, Library of Congress.<lb/><lb/>
            In about 1820, Blake revised <hi rend="i">For Children: The Gates of Paradise</hi>, giving the work a new title, <hi rend="i">For the Sexes: The Gates of Paradise</hi>, reworking the design plates at least twice, and adding three new text plates at the end (19-21). Plates 19-20 contain brief interpretive statements keyed by number to the preceding design plates. The final plate is addressed to Satan as the "God of This [fallen] World." Copies A and B were probably printed c. 1820. Copies C and D, plus a large group of impressions never collated into complete Copies by Blake but now divided into what are designated as Copies J-N, date from c. 1825. Copies E-I are probably posthumous. We now publish Copy D, from the collection of the Pierpont Morgan Library, New York.<lb/><lb/>
            Both electronic editions have newly edited SGML-encoded texts and new images scanned and color-corrected from first-generation 4x5" transparencies; they are each fully searchable for both text and images and supported by the Inote and ImageSizer applications described in our previous updates.<lb/><lb/>
            With the publication of these two titles, the Archive now contains 33 copies of 18 separate books, including at least one copy of every one of Blake's works in illuminated printing except the 100 plates of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> (forthcoming).<lb/><lb/>
            Also, we are pleased to announce that a Tour of the Archive is now available online. Through a sequence of several dozen graphical screenshots linked to narrative commentary, the Tour introduces users to the basic organization and structure of the Archive, the features of its interface, its search options, and the function of the Inote and ImageSizer applications. The Tour is located in the "About the Archive" wing of the site. Available as the first link off our main table of contents page at the URL above, the "About the Archive" materials include, in addition to the Tour, a statement of Editorial Principles and Methodology, a Frequently Asked Questions list, a Technical Summary, and an updated version of the article-length Plan of the Archive detailing our intentions with regard to Blake's non-illuminated works--and more. We hope that the Tour, together with these other materials, will prove valuable both to our own growing user community and to scholars interested in the theory and practice of electronic editing more generally.

of a fourth figure just visible above and to the left of the
central figure in this group.  The left-most figure has one arm
raised horizontally and the other vertically.  Below "Gates" (line 3) in the
title, and on each side of the word "of" (line 4), are two hovering angels
with large wings.  Both have their arms bent with their hands
together in an attitude of prayer.  The angel on the left faces
right; the angel on the right faces left.  There are slight
indications of a gown worn by the angel on the left.  They may be
looking down at a portion of the circumference of sun arcing
between "of" and "Paradise" (line 5) in the title.  Lines of radiance
emanate from the arc, suggesting a sunrise or
sunset.</illusobjdesc><component type="object" location="E"><characteristic>sun</characteristic><characteristic>radiance</characteristic><characteristic>beams of light</characteristic><characteristic>sunrise</characteristic><characteristic>sunset</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A portion of the circumference of sun arcing between

                  stone, we see five seated male figures, all apparently nude (with
                  the possible exceptions of the figures lower left and right).  The central
figure, facing forward, is old and bearded with hair standing on
end; the others are much younger.  He, and the two figures next to
him, appear to be sitting on a low stone step.  There may be three
small windows above them.  The larger, older central figure has his
legs drawn up; his knees are very prominent.  His face suggests
despair or worse.  Immediately to the left, very close to the old
man, is a young man with legs drawn up and crossed at the ankles. 
His knees are also prominent.  His body faces forward, but his head
is turned up and to the right; he may be looking at the face of the
old man.  Although we see only his right shoulder and upper arm,
his right arm may be extended horizontally; he may be embracing the
old man.  On the right is another young male close to the old man. 
His legs are drawn up and crossed at the ankles, with prominent
knees.  His body faces forward, but his head is turned to the left,
with his face pressed against the body or left leg of the old man. 
This figure's hair seems to be long.  Another youthful male sits in
the right foreground.  His legs are extended but slightly bent at
the knees.  Although
probably nude, like his companions, lines just below his knees
suggest that he might be wearing breeches.  His left arm is at his side, with his left hand on the
ground (or, rather, on the floor), fingers spread apart.  He faces
left, with his head bent back and looking up; his mouth is slightly
open.  His hair is probably long.  In the left foreground is the
final youthful figure, seated and with legs extended.  Though he may be nude, lines just below his knees suggest that he, too, may be wearing breeches.  He faces to the right,
with his head down.  His right arm is at is side, with his right
hand on the ground (or, rather, on the floor), fingers spread.  His
hair is curly.  Given the configuration of the males, the setting,
and the compositional relationship to several drawings by Blake,
this design would seem to be inspired by Dante's description of

at least the right arm at his side.  This gowned figure is very
probably an old man, as indicated by his long beard.  His face is
hidden by another figure.  At his feet, rising into the air at a 45
degree angle from lower right to upper left, is another gowned and
bearded old man.  We can see the supine figure's feet through the
lower leg of the rising figure, and thus he is almost certainly the
ghost or spirit of the dead man.  His hair is long and he faces to
the left.  His right arm is bent at the elbow with the forearm
raised horizontally across his body.  The index finger of his right
hand is extended and points to the right.  His left arm is bent at
the elbow with the forearm raised vertically.  One finger of his
left hand points upward.  A radiant light surrounds his head and
body, extending down to his lower legs.  The effect is particularly
prominent around his head and strongly suggests and halo.  Beams of
light radiate from his aura on the left.  In the foreground on the
left is a young man with curly hair.  He squats or sits on his left
leg, bent under his body; his right leg is extended to the right
and bent slightly at the knee.  He may be wearing tights, or at
least a belt around his waist.  His right arm is at his side, with
the fingers of his right hand spread apart.  His mouth is slightly
open and he appears to be looking up and to the right in fear or
surprise at the ghostly figure above and to the right.  He may be
the son of the dead man.  Behind the bed and its corpse we see the
head and upper body of a gowned woman wearing a scarf over her
head.  Her left arm is extended at 45 degrees.  She also looks up
and to the right at the ghost, perhaps with an expression of fear
or surprise.  She may be the wife or daughter of the dead man.

children or grandchildren of the dead man.  Of the child immediately to the right, we see only the face.  The child faces toward the viewer.  The child farthest to the right in this group is
