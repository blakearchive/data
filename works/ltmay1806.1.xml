            <updatestmt> The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of
                electronic editions of our first installment of Blake’s letters, the correspondence
                of his last two years, 1823-27, mostly with his friend, benefactor, and fellow
                artist John Linnell, who sponsored such projects as Blake’s engraved <hi rend="i"
                    >Illustrations of the Book of Job</hi> (1826) and <hi rend="i">Illustrations to
                    Dante</hi>, on which he was still working when he died. <lb/><lb/> About ninety
                of Blake’s letters survive—an unknown fraction of the total. The surviving
                correspondence begins rather late in his career, in October 1791, the month before
                he turned 34, and ends, as far as we know, the month before his death at age 69 in
                August 1823—just three sentences to Linnell, to thank him for sending ten pounds and
                to indicate that his “journey to Hampstead on Sunday brought on a relapse . . . .
                however I am upon the mending hand to day &amp; hope soon to look as I did for I
                have been yellow accompanied by all the old Symptoms.” <lb/><lb/> Blake traveled
                seldom and not very far, and he was little known beyond a small circle of British
                contemporaries, most of them in London. His circle of correspondents was narrow and
                the geographical circuit small. But his modest body of correspondence comprises an
                absorbing, revealing miscellany of reports on work in progress alongside friendly
                and not so friendly exchanges on matters of practical and intellectual substance.
                Occasionally they burst out into visions that amalgamate, in a characteristic
                Blakean vein, homely details, intensely energized prose, and inspired poetry.
                <lb/><lb/> The letters are, in any case, indispensable in preserving facts and
                contexts for his life and work that would be otherwise unknown and in showing him
                shift pragmatically from role to role in a very natural—and human—way, exposing
                facets of character and personality not always so apparent in his art. The letters
                feel closer to the externalities of everyday life than any other work from Blake’s
                hand, and some start out to be one very ordinary thing and end up being another
                quite extraordinary thing. If Blake is not an artist-thinker in correspondence with
                an international circle, he seldom puts pen to paper without interesting
                consequences for readers.<lb/><lb/> In his letter of 12 April 1823 to Linnell, Blake
                refers to a small card he plans to engrave for his friend of many years, George
                Cumberland. An impression of the card is attached to the final page of the letter.
                We are also publishing another impression of Cumberland’s card (see Separate Plates
                and Prints in Series, Designed and Engraved by Blake).<lb/><lb/> The Archive now
                contains fully searchable and scalable electronic editions of important manuscripts
                and series of engravings, color printed drawings, tempera paintings, water color
                drawings, and 85 copies of Blake's nineteen illuminated books--all in the context of
                full bibliographic information about each work, careful diplomatic transcriptions of
                all texts, detailed descriptions of all images, and extensive bibliographies.
                <lb/><lb/> Due to recent security concerns related to Java browser plugins, the
                Archive has disabled its Java-based ImageSizer and Virtual Lightbox applications.
                Users can still view 100 and 300 dpi JPEG images as well as complete transcriptions
                for all works in the Archive. Text searching is also still available for all works
                in the Archive, and image searching remains available for all works except those in
                preview mode. In the coming months the Archive will implement redesigned pages that
                restore the features of ImageSizer and the Virtual Lightbox without the need for
                Java.<lb/><lb/> As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no
                access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible by
                the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with the University of Rochester,
                the continuing support of the Library of Congress, and the cooperation of the
                international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us
                permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive. </updatestmt>

                <note>Original manuscript untraced; photographs of the printed letter taken from a
                    set of six volumes of the *Monthly Magazine* purchased from H.
                    W. Wilson Co. ($6.50) by the Princeton library in March 1932 through the
                    Theodore F. Sanxay Fund.<lb/><lb/>The *Monthly Magazine* began
                    publication in February 1796, and was edited by Sir Richard Phillips, who had
                    partnered with Blake in the 1805 publication of an expanded edition of William
                    Hayley's *Ballads ... Relating to Animals*. Blake's 1806 letter
                    to the *Monthly Magazine* was written in response to an
                    anonymous review of Henry Fuseli's "Ugolino in Prison" in *Bell's
                        Weekly Messenger*, 25 May 1806. Bentley (*Writings*
                    volume 2, page 1631n2) includes partial text from the review: " 'the drawing [of
                    the young female in his arms] is essentially imperfect', and 'we could have
                    wished that this Picture' were not so 'black and heavy' ".<lb/><lb/>Morton D.
                    Paley, "William Blake, Richard Phillips, and the *Monthly
                        Magazine*", *Studies in Romanticism* volume 51, number 1
                    (Spring 2012), identifies Blake's letter to Phillips as one of "at least two
                    letters" that Blake sent to the *Monthly Magazine*", and "the
                    only Blake letter to appear in letterpress during his lifetime" (page 46).
                    Blake's handwritten copy of an earlier, unpublished letter to the *Monthly Magazine* can be viewed in his manuscript letter to George
                    Cumberland, 1 September 1800, objects 2 and 3, in which Blake seeks Cumberland's
                    approval of his proposal "For the Erection of National / Galleries for the
                    Reception of Casts in Plaster from / all the Beautiful Antique. Statues Basso
                    Relivos &amp;c / that can be procured at home or abroad." Another letter from
                    Blake to Phillips of 14 October 1807 was not published in the magazine, but was
                    marked as received by Phillips, "W. B. Rec<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. Oct<hi
                        rend="superscript">r</hi> 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1807. With Mr.
                    P.'s Comps.", according to Bentley (*Writings* volume 2, page
                    1637n2). The 14 October 1807 letter to Phillips, requesting further inquiry into
                    the recent seizure and imprisonment of "an Astrologer," Robert Powell, is now
                    located at the Boston Public Library.<lb/><lb/></note>

                        1806). The letter begins near the bottom of the second column of page 520
                        (object 1) and ends near the top of the second column of page 521 (object

                        these pages. The lines of Blake's letter printed in the second column of
                        page 521 are displayed inline with the first four lines of object 2 in the
