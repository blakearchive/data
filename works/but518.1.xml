    The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of thirty-three of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible.  All take their subjects from the New Testament and have been added to the twenty Old Testament subjects published in March 2010 as “Illustrations to the Bible, c. 1780-1824,” under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.  This new group is presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).
                <lb/><lb/>
                   Blake executed most of these New Testament water colors c. 1800-05 for his patron Thomas Butts.  The exceptions are <hi rend="i">The Whore of Babylon</hi> of 1809 and <hi rend="i">The Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins</hi> in the Yale Center for British Art, datable to c. 1825. The subjects range from the childhood of Jesus to his ascension, the later history of his parents and one of his major followers, St. Paul, and a group of eight designs based on the Book of Revelation.  While the illustrations of the life of Christ are fairly conventional in their subjects, in part because of the long tradition of picturing almost every event in the Gospels, individual motifs recall designs in Blake’s illuminated books and thus offer a window on Blake’s visual interpretation of the Bible. The illustrations of Revelation complement Blake’s intense engagement with apocalyptic events and images in his own poetry.
                    <lb/><lb/>
                        The selection of fifty-three biblical water colors now available in the Archive will be supplemented in the future with early works, such as <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>, datable to c. 1780, and will continue through Blake’s final biblical water colors, such as <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi>. 
                    <lb/><lb/>

Dominating the design is the figure of a male angel who is nearly nude except for an almost transparent piece of cloth that he wears like a sash across his chest and over his genitals. He has short, curly hair and stands, facing forward and slightly right. His right leg is bent and extended backward slightly on tiptoe, which indicates that he may be walking. Flames surround both of his feet. The angel looks up and raises his right arm vertically, palm up. He holds his left arm at his side and in his left hand is an open book with indications of writing on the pages. The sky backing the scene is dark, except for the radiance surrounding the angel's head and upper body. Behind the angel are dark clouds. To the left of the angel's right leg are three male figures on the cloud, all with beards and riding horses. The leftmost figure appears to be old and has long hair. He faces right, wearing a shirt and pants, and sitting on the horse with his right leg bent. His right arm is at his side but bent. The horse ridden by the leftmost figure faces right and down with its back legs extended backward and its front legs extended forward and bent. The middle figure of the group wears a shirt and faces right and forward. He is also riding a horse. The horse ridden by the middle figure faces right and slightly forward. The rightmost figure faces forward and to the right. He may have a crown or hat on his head and wear a shirt. He may also ride a horse, but its form is just hinted at, facing right. Between the angel's legs on the cloud are two male figures with short, curly hair and beards, facing right. The leftmost figure rides a horse and has his right arm and right leg both bent. He may wear a shirt and pants or a gown. The horse ridden by the leftmost figure faces right and may be standing. One rein is pictured on the horse. The rightmost figure faces slightly forward and may be riding a horse, but its form is only hinted at. To the right of the angel's left leg on the cloud are two male figures with beards, facing right. The leftmost figure may wear a shirt and pants or a gown and has long, slightly curly hair. His right arm is bent upward and his right leg is bent as he sits on his horse. The horse ridden by the leftmost figure faces right and up and may be climbing upward. The rightmost figure may have short, curly hair and may wear a shirt and pants or a gown. His right leg is bent as he sits on his horse. The horse ridden by the rightmost figure faces right and up and may be climbing upward. The angel dominating the design stands with his right foot on choppy waves, representing the sea, and with his left foot on earth that may be grassy and rocky. At the bottom center of the design sits a male figure wearing a gown. This is John of Patmos looking at the revelation above him. He has short, curly hair and faces away, looking up and to the left. His left leg is bent and extended backward on tiptoe. His right arm is raised at 45 degrees and bent and in his right hand he holds what may be a quill pen. This figure sits on a rock, over which is a partly open scroll on which John has probably been writing.
