                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>The general theme and subject of this composition were probably influenced by several biblical passages, including Ruth 2:1-17, I Samuel 12:16-19, and Matthew 9:38.  Several groups of figures appear to labor in an agricultural (wheat?) field.  Three male figures stand or walk in the center of the composition facing right.  The rightmost of these is visible only from the waist up and raises clasped hands in what may be a gesture of prayer.  The central figure, also only visible from the waist up, bends his right arm and extends his left, with fingers spread.  The leftmost figure of this trio, who is gowned, extends his left leg backward and raises both arms at approximately 45 degrees, palms facing up.  He turns his head to the left to look down at the group of three figures in the lower left corner of the scene.  This may be Christ.  Three(?) small figures are positioned above this group, apparently in the distance.  In the lower right corner of the composition, two gowned female figures walk left.  The rightmost figure may carry something in her arms, possibly a bundle of grain, and her companion extends her left leg backward and points down at the ground with her left hand.  Above these figures in the distance is another figure, possibly with arms raised vertically.  Three figures stand, squatting slightly, lower left.  The figure furthest left in this group raised his(?) arms horizontally, hands together.  The figure on the right in this group extends his bent left arm and hand upward, fingers spread.  Above is the head and upper body of a figure, apparently with his(?) left arm bent over his chest and possibly carrying a large object (a sack of wheat?) on his back.  Multiple structures, perhaps a barn or house at left and a silo at right, stand in the upper left corner of the scene.  Vertical lines in the foreground likely indicate the agricultural crop and background horizontal lines suggest additional fields.</illusobjdesc>
