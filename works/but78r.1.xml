                    <illusobjdesc>Seen from behind, a winged male figure who is nude with prominent buttocks stands on the right side of the composition.  Although his body faces away from the viewer, he turns his head to face left so that his face is seen in profile.  His hair is short; his expression and furrowed brow suggest anger.  Leaning slightly to the left, he raises his left arm horizontally with palm facing away and fingers spread.  His right arm is by his side, and he carries a weapon (perhaps a stick or rod?) in his right hand.  He raises his right heel slightly, which may suggest impending movement leftward.</illusobjdesc>
