The first six copies were color printed that year; four of these copies were printed on both sides of the leaves and two were printed on one side only. Copy G belongs to the former issue and joins in the Archive Copy E from the same issue and Copy B, more heavily printed, from the latter. It also joins Copy H, the only monochrome copy, printed in 1795, and Copy K, from the last printing session, c. 1821. With each printing session represented in the Archive, users can trace the full printing history of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>.
            <lb/><lb/>
            Like all the illuminated books in the Archive, the text and images of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> Copy G are fully searchable and are supported by our Inote and ImageSizer applications. With the Archive's Compare feature, users can easily juxtapose multiple impressions of any plate across the different copies of this or any of the other illuminated books. With our new Related Works feature, launched last month, users can access related materials through active links on the work index pages and in the Show Me menu on the object view pages. New protocols for transcription, which produce improved accuracy and fuller documentation in editors' notes, have been applied to all copies of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> in the Archive.
            <lb/><lb/>
            With the publication of this copy of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>, the Archive now contains fully searchable and scalable electronic editions of seventy-one copies of Blake's nineteen illuminated books in the context of full bibliographic information about each work, careful diplomatic transcriptions of all texts, detailed descriptions of all images, and extensive bibliographies. In addition to illuminated books, the Archive contains many important manuscripts and series of engravings, sketches, and water color drawings, including Blake's illustrations to Thomas Gray's <hi rend="i">Poems</hi>, water color and engraved illustrations to Dante's <hi rend="i">Divine Comedy</hi>, the large color printed drawings of 1795 and c. 1805, the Linnell and Butts sets of the <hi rend="i">Book of Job</hi> water colors and the sketchbook containing drawings for the engraved illustrations to the <hi rend="i">Book of Job</hi>, the water color illustrations to Robert Blair's <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, and all nine of Blake's water color series illustrating the poetry of John Milton.

A nude male sits crouching in a contracted posture within the mouth of a cave

the other figure.  His left arm is bent at the elbow, with his 
forearm and index finger on his left hand pointing up.  He grasps a 
knife or dagger in his right hand.  He may be an assassin, 
contemplating the murder of the figure to the left.  This second figure 
is a youthful male wearing tights, a hat, a bundle or 
backpack on his back, and belts over his chest.  He strides 
forward and to the left.  He faces left and holds a walking-stick 
in his right hand.  His left arm is bent at the elbow, with his 
left forearm and hand behind his back.  He is probably one of 
Blake's representations of a traveler.  Below his feet is a path 
or road.  To the right of this walking figure, above the 
cave with the assassin, is some undifferentiated vegetation, 
perhaps the leaves of trees. At least two distinct leaves appear on the 
ground below the traveler, and some indeterminate vegetation—perhaps 
moss—is pictured to the right of the crouched figure.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="B"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>assassin</characteristic><characteristic>crouching</characteristic><characteristic>sitting</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>legs drawn up</characteristic><characteristic>legs crossed</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent</characteristic><characteristic>pointing</characteristic><characteristic>contracted</characteristic><characteristic>knife</characteristic><characteristic>dagger</characteristic><characteristic>smiling</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A nude male sits crouching in a contracted posture

detached vine) descends with one further loop in the left margin to line 11.  A long, wavy vine extends between lines 5 and 6.  On it is a 
long-legged spider, just above "other sons" in line 6. There is also undifferentiated vegetation at the base of the cave on the right. The 
large leaves left of the cave may be oak leaves.  
Further to the left, under the first word of line 5, is a small 
form that may be a fly, moth, or butterfly.  A vine trails 
downward from this same word ("And") in line 5.  Just left of the beginning of line 14 is a 
flying creature, perhaps an insect of some sort.  In the bottom 
left corner of the plate, a vine descends from the first letter 
of the first word in the last line of text ("And").  In the right margin, 
another branch of the vine extending between lines 5 and 6 descends from the design above the text all the way to the lower 
margin.  It bears loops, at least two types of leaves, and perhaps some fruit or flowers.  A butterfly sits on the upper reaches 
of this vine (opposite line 5); a worm or caterpillar inches its way across the upper reaches of a large, slender leaf opposite 
the space between lines 9 and 10 in other copies, but it might simply be a small leaf in this copy.  Other branches of this vine 
extend above the falling figure and intertwine with the large leaf to the right of this same figure.  To the right are two flying 
birds.  A separate vine with spiky leaves twists right of lines 6 and 7, growing from the "d" in "thunder."  Below one of its tendrils, 
and just to the right of line 9, is a flying insect, perhaps a beetle or fly.  A somewhat 
jagged vine extends horizontally following line 8; to the right 
is another vine, growing from the top of the second letter of 
"of" in line 9.</illusobjdesc><component type="animal" location="D"><characteristic>butterfly</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A butterfly sits on the upper reaches of the vine

left leg extended and his right bent at the knee with his right 
foot below his prominent (if somewhat abstractly rendered) 
genitals.  He looks down and to the right. With his right arm he 
grasps another bald nude around the neck, apparently in an 
attempt to strangle him.  The central figure's left arm is bent 
at the elbow and his left hand grasps the neck of a third bald nude figure.  
The figure on the left has his legs spread and bent 
at the knees.  He looks up and to the right and tries, with both 
hands, to release the central male's arm from around his neck.  
The wrestler on the right has his legs spread, with his left leg 
extended vertically and his right leg bent at the knee.  His arms 
are bent back over his shoulders and possibly grasp the left leg of the 
central male.  All three figures have caricature-like facial

a great deal of interlinear decoration, the major pictorial

hovering horizontally in the air just below the heading, is a 
gowned female.  The hem of her garment forms a snake-like tail.  Her body is twisted, 
facing forward below the waist and facing down above the waist.  Her long, curled hair cascades over (and

her hands are clasped behind her head.  She has large

nature goddess of fallen time and space, and as the "nameless

vegetative motifs.  The figures, particularly the larger ones, 
may be the "sons &amp; daughters" (line 9) of Enitharmon referred to on 
the plate.  The lower left corner of "A" (in "A / PROPHECY" [lines 2-3]) grows 
into a long vine with branches.  Standing on this vine, near the 
left foot of the letter, is a human figure facing forward.  His 
or her arms, raised vertically, grow into limbs of a tree that 
bend downwards, as with a willow.  The motif suggests the 
classical myth of Daphne and her vegetating metamorphosis.  This 
parallel suggests that the figure is female.  On the right foot 
of "A" is a tree, possibly a palm, with branches that bend 
downward.  To the left of the "A" and slightly below it is a male(?) 
embracing a female.  Both hover in the air, with the male on the 
right and facing to the left.  The male is nude; the woman is gowned and has a long, snake-like tail of drapery 
extending behind her.  The man's body is twisted into a 
curve, seen from behind.  His left arm is raised horizontally and 
embraces the woman's waist.  His right leg is extended 
horizontally.  We also see the woman from behind, with her body 
twisted into a curve matching the man's.  Both her arms are 
raised horizontally, with her head facing down.  These gestures 
suggest that she is trying to escape from the man.  In contrast, 
the couple right of the letter "A" is embracing mutually and 
appear to be kissing.  The winged male(?), possibly an angel, hovers 
horizontally in the air, with his arms raised at 45 degrees to 
embrace the woman(?) who hovers vertically.  She too is winged and 
may be an angel.  Her legs are bent back and her arms raised at 
135 degrees to embrace her companion.  He faces down and to the 
left; she faces up and to the right.  Below the "A" is a hunched 
over, and apparently gowned, figure facing to the left.  This 
extremely contracted figure, with his or her upper body and head 
bent down to touch the upper legs, sits on a cloud outline.  
Other cloud outlines extend to the upper right and below 
"PROPHECY" in the heading.  On the right, below a cloud outline 
and above the last letter of "PROPHECY," two nude figures seen 
from behind soar in the sky, left arms raised horizontally and 
right arms raised at 135 degrees.  The letters of "PROPHECY" are 
well decorated with eight human figures and vines.  Proceeding 
from left to right, these include a vine with leaves or lily-like 
flowers intertwined with the first letter and extending to the 
second.  A small standing figure holds the vertical of the first 
"P."  Another figure stands on the foot of the vertical of the 
"R" and faces to the left with arms raised vertically.  Above 
this figure is a small form that may be a descending child or 
infant, arms stretched downward toward the adult.  The right foot 
of the "R" bears a very small seated figure, hunched over and 
facing to the right.  The letter "O" has two vines with lily-like 
flowers.  Standing within the "O" is a figure facing forward and 
with left arm raised horizontally to hold a shepherd's crook.  To 
the right of this shepherd is a small flock of sheep.  Three 
vines, or perhaps flames, spring from the foot of the second "P." 
A vine, perhaps with a few leaves, is intertwined with the next 
three letters ("HEC").  The final vine in this group springs from 
the foot of the final letter and forms a spiral above and to the 
right of the letter.  This "Y" also bears three human figures.  
One, seen from behind and with legs spread and arms raised 
vertically, seems to be climbing, with the right foot on the foot 
of the "Y" and the left foot on the "C."  Above, standing on the top left end of the "Y," is a figure walking to the left. 
Finally, the first bend in the vine growing from the right side 
of the final letter bears a seated figure facing right, with back 
slightly hunched over and right arm extended to the right knee.  
This figure holds a book or tablet and is probably reading.  Two 
flames, or perhaps a flame-like plant, spring from the foot of 
the "Y" on its right side.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="AB"><characteristic>group of figures</characteristic><characteristic>Enitharmon's son</characteristic><characteristic>Enitharmon's daughter</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The human figures surrounding the heading,

in turn resting on a cloud.  He faces forward and wears the 
triple-crown of a Pope.  His face, however, may be a caricature 
of George III.  He holds on his lap an open book.  Large, bat-like wings extend from behind his arms.  In some copies, the figure appears to 
have bat-like ears that merge with the pointed arches on the throne behind him.  The 
coloring in Copy G suggests that the figure has human ears, particularly noticeable 
on the figure’s right.  He appears to be smiling.  The back of this 
chair resembles the facade of a Gothic church, with arches and 
spires right and left.  His gown between his legs seems to 
contain embroidered pictures of at least one, and perhaps as many 
as four, gowned and standing figures, although their 
representation is very unclear in this copy.  Below this Pope, 
and below the cloud, are two female angels, right and left, with 
large wings.  Both have long hair, are gowned, bow and look down, 
and have one arm extended at 45 degrees.  Each holds in her

dense mass of lines that apparently represents a web; the other 
webs are more clearly pictured with finer lines.  At least four 
spiders appear on the web: right of line 
20, in a dense web below the first word ("Fled") in line 21, 
above "wide" in line 23, and right of lines 29-31 (dangling on a 
single thread).  A fifth spider appears above "&amp;

the design, although some are simply suggested by little more 
than dots.  The larger and more identifiable insects are a winged 
insect right of lines 11-13, a fly or butterfly further to the 
right and just below the mass of lines in the top right corner, 
perhaps a fly below this insect, four flies (two very small) 
right of lines 15-17, a large winged insect (a beetle?) right of 
line 21 and halfway to the right margin, a caterpillar below and 
to the left of this last insect, another winged fly or beetle 
above and to the right of the spider between lines 21 and 22, and 
a large fly or beetle (and a cluster of very small insects) below 
"he drag'd" in line 21.  The landscape below the text is filled 
with heavy vegetation, including low plants with large leaves and 
a vine with one loop and three large leaves intertwined with the 
spider web in the lower right corner.  Just to the left is a nude figure 
of uncertain gender sitting on the ground and completely covered by a fine 
net or web.  The legs are bent at the knees and the body is twisted so that 
the figure faces forward.  The head is bent back and she or he looks up (although 
the eyes may be closed).  The upper body is braced up on the elbows.  The hands are 
held together in an attitude of supplication or prayer.

birds, insects, and three snakes. Four or five 
butterflies appear right of lines 2-5.  A vine descends from the 
first letter of the first word in line 7.  Two vines grow from 
the first letter of the first word in line 10.  Vines, at least 
three birds, an insect(?) on a leaf, and flames decorate the space 
between lines 6 and 7.  A butterfly and two other winged insects, 
two vines (one may be a worm), and an odd shape that may be two 
moths flying close together appear between lines 9 and 10.  A vine 
with multiple branches and leaves wends its way through the 
margin right of lines 9-20.  At least one flower, shaped like a 
Meadia, grows close to the right margin of the plate, right of 
line 10.  Another such flower appears below and to the left of the 
first one, right of line 13.  On and around this large vine are an inch-worm (below the last word in line 9),
caterpillars (above and to the right of line 15 and right of 
lines 10-11 and 16-17), a spider (right of line 15), and several flying 
insects.  Five flying insects (at least one a butterfly) follow 
line 12.  A vine descends left of the first word in line 16.  A 
vine with two loops grows from the descender of the last letter 
of "thy" in line 21.  A large bird, possibly an eagle, and three 
smaller birds or insects fly near the right margin of the plate 
right of lines 19-21.  A vine with many loops fills the 
considerable space between lines 21 and 22 and descends in the 
right margin to line 27.  On this vine are at least two large and 
two small caterpillars, an inch-worm, two snails, at least three 
spiders, at least two insects with wings folded, and a bird perched near the right margin with its mouth 
open (because it is singing?).  Just to the left, within loops of the vine, is another singing bird, facing left with mouth open.  A large moth or butterfly appears 
below "Antamon" in line 21.  A flying insect is pictured far to the right of 
line 24.  Below and to the left is a large bird (possibly an 
eagle) soaring upwards, with a flock of at least five birds to the left.  
The form right of lines 27-31 probably represents the sky.  A 
vine descends from the second letter of "my" in line 26.  A vine 
with leaves and several branches appears right of lines 28-38.  Intertwined with this vine is a snake, 
facing to the left with its mouth open and its forked tongue 
clearly pictured.  Two other snakes, both facing left, appear in 
the bottom margin.  The right-most snake in the lower margin has 
a clearly pictured tongue.  The last letter of the last word in 
line 35 ("revelry") grows into a vine.</illusobjdesc><component type="animal" location="B"><characteristic>butterfly</characteristic><characteristic>flying</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Four or five butterflies fly right of lines 2-5 of the
