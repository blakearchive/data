                electronic edition of thirty-three of Blake’s water color illustrations to the
                Bible. All take their subjects from the New Testament and have been added to the
                twenty Old Testament subjects published in March 2010 as “Illustrations to the
                Bible, c. 1780-1824,” under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings. This new
                group is presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the
                Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of
                Blake’s images). <lb/><lb/> Blake executed most of these New Testament water colors c. 1800-05 for his
                patron Thomas Butts. The exceptions are <hi rend="i">The Whore of Babylon</hi> of
                1809 and <hi rend="i">The Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins</hi> in the Yale
                Center for British Art, datable to c. 1825. The subjects range from the childhood of
                Jesus to his ascension, the later history of his parents and one of his major
                followers, St. Paul, and a group of eight designs based on the Book of Revelation.
                While the illustrations of the life of Christ are fairly conventional in their
                subjects, in part because of the long tradition of picturing almost every event in
                the Gospels, individual motifs recall designs in Blake’s illuminated books and thus
                offer a window on Blake’s visual interpretation of the Bible. The illustrations of
                Revelation complement Blake’s intense engagement with apocalyptic events and images
                in his own poetry. <lb/><lb/> The selection of fifty-three biblical water colors now available in the
                Archive will be supplemented in the future with early works, such as <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>, datable to c. 1780, and will continue through Blake’s
                final biblical water colors, such as <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the
                    Bulrushes</hi>. <lb/><lb/> As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access
                restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible by the
                University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with the University of Rochester, the

                        a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal." Dominating the center of
                        the design is the river referenced in the text. Six figures stand on, hover
                        just above, or swim in the river. The leftmost figure is that of a gowned
                        man, facing away and to the right in profile. He has long hair and holds a
                        small horn or trumpet that he presumably plays. He has his arms at his
                        sides, but bent upward. His right leg is bent backward and on tiptoe,
                        suggesting that he is walking, perhaps on the top of the water. The figure
                        second from the left is that of a nude child, facing down and away but
                        looking up and to the right in profile. The child is possibly male(?) and is
                        swimming, with his left leg bent and his left arm raised horizontally. His
                        right arm is raised at 135 degrees and is held by the figure to the right.
                        This figure, third from the left, may be that of an adult male(?), gowned
                        and with long hair. He faces away and his legs are bent as he swims, with
                        his arms raised at 45 degrees. In each hand, he holds the hands of the
                        children swimming by his side. The third figure from the right is a nude
                        male(?) child with short hair, facing away. He swims with his legs bent
                        slightly and his arms raised at 135 degrees. His left arm is being held by
                        the male swimmer to the left. The figure second from the right may be that
                        of a gowned female with curly hair pulled up. She(?) appears to be wearing a
                        cloth band on her head and holds a plate or bowl in her left hand.
                        Alternatively, she may be holding a knife and, like the Fate Atropos, is
                        cutting the thread of life although no thread is pictured. She faces forward
                        and down, bending forward as her lower body faces right and her upper body
                        faces left. She may be looking at the plate or knife that she holds. Her
                        legs are both bent slightly and her left arm is raised horizontally. She may
                        be standing on the water. The rightmost figure of the group may be a gowned
                        female with long hair pulled up into a bun, facing away and to the left. She
                        may be walking, as indicated by her left leg, which is bent back and on
                        tiptoe. Her arms are at her side but bent and she holds a flute that she may
                        be playing. One figure hovers or flies above the river, a nude male facing
                        down, forward, and to the left. His legs are both bent and his left arm is
                        raised at 45 degrees, with his right arm raised vertically. He may be
                        pointing with both hands. His hair is slightly curly. In the midground, on
                        the right bank of the river is a building with a decorative pilaster and
                        capitol by an open door. The branches of a leafy and fruit-laden tree extend
                        above the building. Wrapped around the rightmost tree is a vine bearing
                        grape-like clusters of fruit. Clustered around this building are four gowned
                        figures. The leftmost figure is an old male with curly hair and a long
                        beard. He faces forward and holds a book under his right arm, which is at
                        his side. The second figure from the left may be a male with short, curly
                        hair who bends his right arm and holds it against his chest. He faces
                        forward and looks to the left, in profile. The second figure from the right
                        is a child, perhaps with short hair. Its gender is indeterminable. It faces
                        forward and its left arm is at its side. The rightmost figure is that of an
                        old man with long hair and a beard. He faces left, in profile and slightly
                        away, looking down. His arms are bent and he holds what may be loose pieces
                        of paper or a book. In the midground on the left river bank is a house with
                        pilasters and decorative capitols on either side of an open doorway, as well
                        as a large window with glass panes. Above the window are pictures of two or
                        three floating figures holding hands. There are slight suggestions of such
                        figures above the door. Either side of the building are two leafy and
                        fruit-laden trees. There are four figures clustered in front of the
                        building. The leftmost figure wears a gown and faces forward and right,
                        looking away. This figure may be a male with short hair. His legs may be
                        crossed as his left foot protrudes from under the right side of his hem; he
                        may be wearing a shoe. His right arm is raised horizontally and he points
                        with his right hand. The second figure from the left is a gowned female with
                        her long hair at least partly pulled up. She stands, facing forward and to
                        the right and looking down. Her left foot protrudes from below the hem of
                        her gown. Her arms are bent upward and perhaps crossed as she holds an
                        infant. The figure second from the right of this group is an infant with
                        short hair. It is of indeterminable gender and lies, facing left, up, and
                        slightly away. It may be wrapped in a cloth. The rightmost figure of this
                        group faces left and looks up. She has long hair and wears a gown. She
                        stands on tiptoe with her right arm raised vertically, perhaps reaching for
                        some fruit. In the background on the left river bank is a building with
                        three pillars visible. To the left of these three pillars may be another
                        pillar, or tree trunk. There is a leafy tree extending above and to the
                        right side of the structure. There are two figures of indeterminate gender,
                        facing forward, standing to the right of the three pillars. In the
                        background on the right river bank stand two gowned and winged angels of
                        indeterminable gender, facing away. Right of the angels are at least two
                        tree trunks and leafy branches. The river banks appear to be sandy or
                        grassy. A hill is visible in the background, on the right of a large sun
                        that dominates the top of the design, emanating beams of light. The position
                        of the sun on the horizon may indicate sunrise or sunset. Around the sun
                        stand or hover five winged and gowned angels, facing forward. In between the
                        second and third, third and fourth, and fourth and fifth angels from the
                        left hover pairs of embracing figures. These figures may be nude and face
                        each other, with the left figure of each pair facing right and the right
                        figure of each pair facing left. Their bodies are horizontal.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="AC"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>hovering</characteristic><characteristic>facing away</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>seen from behind</characteristic><characteristic>walking</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>playing</characteristic><characteristic>horn</characteristic><characteristic>trumpet</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>arms at side</characteristic><characteristic>arms bent</characteristic><characteristic>arms bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent at knee</characteristic><characteristic>leg extended backward</characteristic><characteristic>tiptoe</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Six figures stand on, hover just above, or swim in the River
