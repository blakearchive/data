In the center of the design kneels Jesus, facing away but with his head bent up. His is bending, perhaps falling, backward. He wears a gown, has long hair and a beard, and raises his arms at 45 degrees, a posture that suggests his later crucifixion. He may be looking at the angel above him. Above Jesus, bending down and seen from behind, though looking slightly forward, is a (male?) angel. The angel is nude from the waist up and has long hair. He holds Jesus around his waist. The angel is surrounded by a cloud; a burst of fiery light emanates from his waist. In the foreground are hints of grass, though it is dark. This may be a night scene. At least six tree trunks with hints of leafy branches are visible. To the left of Jesus, amidst the tree trunks, is a shadowy figure. This may be a sleeping disciple, as his eyes appear to be closed. He appears to have long hair and faces right, sitting or crouching. He wears a cloak or some other item of clothing with a hood. To the right of Jesus are two more shadowy figures, probably disciples, amidst the trees. The left figure faces forward and sits or crouches, perhaps leaning on a tree trunk. He appears to have long, curly hair and his eyes are closed. He may be sleeping. The figure to the right sits or crouches, facing left, with his eyes closed. He has long(?) hair and a beard. He may also be sleeping.
