<updatestmt> 
The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of a digital edition of forty-seven monochrome wash drawings created by Blake between c. 1774 and c. 1786.  
<lb/>
<lb/>
The use of monochrome washes to tint a pencil or pen and ink drawing offered eighteenth-century artists several advantages. They could register gradations in tone, from the white of the untouched paper to jet black, without the more time-consuming use of actual colors. No further work was required if the wash drawing was intended as a preliminary for an uncolored engraving. A monochrome wash could also be used to underlie subsequent applications of water colors, thereby darkening selected areas to create the illusion of depth or cast motifs in shadow.  
<lb/>
<lb/>
As the works presented here show, Blake made full use of monochrome washes from his earliest years as an artist. When assigned by his engraving master, James Basire, to record tombs in Westminster Abbey c. 1774-75, Blake applied black and gray washes to tint many of his drawings (Objects 1-5). These carefully executed works could then be used as preliminaries for subsequent engravings by Basire’s workshop.
<lb/>
<lb/>
Blake’s monochrome washes during his first decade as an independent artist and engraver include several interrelated groups. The seven drawings of figures from Michelangelo’s Sistine ceiling (Objects 37-43) demonstrate how copying engravings of works by Renaissance masters helped Blake learn postures and gestures he would later use in his own compositions. Other drawings provide visual evidence of how Blake developed a design from early sketches to highly finished water colors or engravings. The recto/verso drawings, <hi rend="i">Two Sketches for “Joseph Making Himself Known to His Brethren”</hi> (Objects 34 and 35), are preliminaries for the finished water color in the Fitzwilliam Museum, one of three illustrations of the biblical story of Joseph that are among Blake’s finest pictorial works of the 1780s. The three Joseph water colors are in the Archive along with a water color preliminary for <hi rend="i">Joseph Ordering Simeon to be Bound</hi>. The evolution of one of Blake’s earliest original book illustrations, a frontispiece for Thomas Commins’ <hi rend="i">Elegy Set to Music</hi> of 1786, can be traced through three variant wash drawings (Objects 45-47) and a pencil sketch also in the Archive. The four wash versions of <hi rend="i">The Good Farmer</hi> reproduced here (Objects 16-19), in addition to two pen and ink drawings of the subject previously added to the Archive, show the complex ways Blake played variations on a theme as he worked toward a final version. No such finished work is known, and thus these drawings are our only record of Blake’s engagement with this subject. Similarly, for <hi rend="i">War Unchained by an Angel, Fire, Pestilence, and Famine Following</hi>, an untraced work Blake exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1784, we have only a preliminary study (Object 6).
<lb/>
<lb/>
Blake’s illustrations to his poem <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> of c. 1789 are among his most accomplished monochrome wash drawings. These have been published in the Archive as an independent group coordinated with the <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> manuscript.

                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>In the drawing's center, an old man representing Job sits on the ground with his knees drawn up toward his chest and his arms bent upward just outside his knees. Job's bare feet are planted on the ground in front of him. His right leg is covered by his long gown, but his left leg--which leans outward slightly--is uncovered at least to the knee, and perhaps to the hip, which is pictured on the ground below. Job's elbows point outward and may rest on his knees or legs. Job raises his hands to his face, turning both hands inward to support his head under the jaws; his fingers curl, perhaps covering his ears or grasping his hair. The cuffs of Job's long-sleeved gown appear below his hands. Job's long, curly beard occupies the space between his wrists and extends down between his knees. Long, wavy hair covers Job's head, which turns slightly to the left as he gazes toward something beyond the drawing's frame. Job's mouth is open, and his brows are knitted in an expression of grief or even despair. Three marks appear on Job's left cheek, suggesting tears. At left of Job sits his wife. She faces forward and to the right, bending toward Job as she pulls her knees into her chest in a contracted posture. Her bare right foot appears on the ground next to Job's right foot, and her legs are drawn up in front of her. Job's wife wraps her arms around her legs and clasps her hands in front of her knees by interlacing her fingers. Her shoulders hunch forward, and her neck extends forward so that her head hovers over her knees. Job's wife wears a long-sleeved gown with cuffs and a long, voluminous skirt that covers her legs. Another cloth may drape around her waist and right hip. She has long hair that parts in the center and drapes over both shoulders. Her head turns downward, and she appears to gaze at the ground in front of Job. Her mouth is open in an expression of despair. On Job's other side, occupying the right third of the drawing, sit three of his friends. Nearest the viewer kneels an old man with long hair and a long beard. His legs bend sharply, and he sits on his heels facing forward and to the left. His legs are entirely covered by the skirt of a long-sleeved gown with folded cuffs. The man bends forward, toward Job, and raises his hands in front of his chest. Each arm bends upward so that the forearms are nearly horizontal; the man's left hand hovers over his right, and the fingers of each hand points toward the opposite arm. The man's head tilts downward, and his downcast eyes suggest an expression of grief. Above and to the left of the old man's head is the face of another man, which bears a similarly grievous expression. This central man has short, curly hair and a beard of similar texture. He wears a long-sleeved gown like that of his counterparts. His head and eyes are lowered; he may look at the ground near where Job sits. The man kneels on the ground. His right arm bends at 90 degrees so that his forearm crosses his body (though his right hand is hidden by the beard of the man in front of him). His left arm extends downward in front of him, and he points toward the ground with his index finger. At left of this man appears the head and right arm of the third friend, furthest from the viewer. This man also has curly hair and a beard. His head and eyes lower in an expression of grief. His right arm bends upward so that his cupped hand supports his face. The cuffed sleeve below his wrist suggests that the man wears a gown or shirt, but the rest of his body is hidden by those of the other friends. The five figures stand out against a darker background. The setting is unclear, apart from the floor or ground on which the figures sit. Prominent shadows appear below the chin and hands of Job's wife, between Job and his friends, and behind the rightmost friend in the group.</illusobjdesc>

Her shoulders hunch forward, and her neck extends forward so that her head hovers over her knees. Job's wife wears a long-sleeved gown with cuffs and a long, voluminous skirt that covers her legs. Another cloth may drape around her waist and right hip. She has long hair that parts in the center and drapes over both shoulders. Her head turns downward, and she appears to gaze at the ground in front of Job. Her mouth is open in an expression of despair.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>On Job's other side, occupying the right third of the drawing, sit three of his friends. Nearest the viewer kneels an old man with long hair and a long beard. His legs bend sharply, and he sits on his heels facing forward and to the left. His legs are entirely covered by the skirt of a long-sleeved gown with folded cuffs. The man bends forward, toward Job, and raises his hands in front of his chest. Each arm bends upward so that the forearms are nearly horizontal; the man's left hand hovers over his right, and the fingers of each hand points toward the opposite arm. The man's head tilts downward, and his downcast eyes suggest an expression of grief.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>On Job's other side, occupying the right third of the drawing, sit three of his friends. The central man bears a grievous expression similar to that of the old man in front of him. This younger man has short, curly hair and a curly beard. He wears a long-sleeved gown like that of his counterparts. His head and eyes are lowered; he may look at the ground near where Job sits. The man kneels on the ground. His right arm bends at 90 degrees so that his forearm crosses his body (though his right hand is hidden by the beard of the man in front of him). His left arm extends downward in front of him, and he points toward the ground with his index finger.</illusobjdesc>

Leftmost in the group, furthest from the viewer, appears the head and right arm of the third friend. This man also has curly hair and a beard. His head and eyes lower in an expression of grief. His right arm bends upward so that his cupped hand supports his face. The cuffed sleeve below his wrist suggests that the man wears a gown or shirt, but the rest of his body is hidden by those of the other friends.</illusobjdesc>
