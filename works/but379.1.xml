Eve stands on tiptoe facing forward, with her right arm raised at 135 degrees, palm up, and her left arm raised at 45 degrees, palm down. Her left leg is extended backward slightly. The serpent's crested head faces left and down, with the suggestion of exposed teeth in its smiling(?) mouth.  The forbidden fruit and two leaves dangle from the serpent's mouth. It may be looking at Eve's raised right hand. To the left of the end of snake's tail lies Adam, supine though with his lower body turned to face forward. He, like Eve, is nude and has curly hair. Adam lies asleep with his arms at his side and his eyes closed. To the left of Eve is the trunk of a tree, its leafy(?) branches arching into the upper right corner of the design. This tree probably represents the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. In the background a moon with the crescent in its base presides over a night sky, with scattered clouds. The landscape is covered with indeterminate vegetation. A waterfall and river run to the left of Adam, and there re hills or distant mountains to the right of Eve's left hand.  A clump of trees rises above the waterfall.
