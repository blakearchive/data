                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>This design, a more complex development of Butlin 118 recto, depicts Saul granting David permission to fight Goliath (I Samuel 17: 32-37). Near the design's center stands a nude (or partially draped) man with short, curly hair and a beard. A crown sits atop his head, suggesting that he is the biblical figure Saul. Saul faces forward and to the right with his right leg straight and his left bent slightly, as if stepping forward. Saul's left arm dangles at his side, nearly straight, but his right is raised vertically. His fingers gather into a fist in a gesture that suggests power or dominance. Saul's head turns rightward to look at David and the figures that appear in the right half of the design. Immediately to the left of Saul, another male figure sits on a chair or throne. He also has short, curly hair and a beard, but he appears to be wearing a skirt or other garment from the waist down and a cape or cloth draped over his right shoulder. The man faces forward and sits with his legs spread at the knees but crossed at the ankles, right over left. His right foot is planted on the ground, and his hands rest on his knees as his arms bend close to his sides. He turns his head to the right, watching the figures that move in that half of the design. Both this man and Saul appear atop a stage or raised platform. To the right of Saul, a gowned old man steps from this platform onto the floor beneath. The man has long, wavy hair, a long beard, and a prominent mustache. He gazes forward with wide eyes as he strides forward, stepping down with his bare right foot. His arms are lowered at his sides, held outward slightly with palms forward in a posture of openness or perhaps supplication. To the right and in front of the old man is a younger male figure who likewise steps from the raised platform down onto the floor below. This man, presumably David, is nude except for a cape or drapery visible at right. He has shoulder-length hair that flows behind him. His torso faces the viewer, but his hips turn slightly to the left as he steps downward with his right foot. David's left arm bends slightly, bringing his hand near his left hip; his right arm extends downward, held approximately 45 degrees from his body. The fingers of his right hand spread wide but appear to be wrapped with some sort of string or cord. David's head turns sharply to the left, and he appears to gaze toward the throned man. These four prominent figures are surrounded by six more that are less clearly defined. They are, from left to right: an old, bearded man who sits or kneels, facing right, with his arms folded upward; three gowned figures of indeterminate gender who stand behind this man and the throne, facing forward and to the right; a bearded man who stands behind and to the right of Saul, gazing toward him; and a long-haired, bearded man who stands along the design's right border, facing left. Each of these figures stands, sits, or kneels atop the raised platform, which extends horizontally across from the design's left border until it reaches a right angle and approaches the viewer near the lower right-hand corner of the design. Both this platform and the floor appear to be bare, as do the room's walls. The upper portion of the back wall, above and to the right of Saul, is shaded darker than the rest. Other shadowy areas appear underneath the throned man's legs, at Saul's left arm, along the left side of the long-haired old man, and behind David's feet.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>To the right of Saul, a gowned old man steps from this platform onto the floor beneath. The man has long, wavy hair, a long beard, and a prominent mustache. He gazes forward with wide eyes as he strides forward, stepping down with his bare right foot. His arms are lowered at his sides, held outward slightly with palms forward in a posture of openness or perhaps supplication.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>To the right and in front of the old man is a younger male figure who likewise steps from the raised platform down onto the floor below. This man, presumably David, is nude except for a cape or drapery visible at right. He has shoulder-length, wavy hair that flows behind him. His torso faces the viewer, but his hips turn slightly to the left as he steps downward with his right foot. David's left arm bends slightly, bringing his hand near his left hip; his right arm extends downward, held approximately 45 degrees from his body. The fingers of his right hand spread wide but appear to be wrapped with some sort of string or cord. David's head turns sharply to the left, and he appears to gaze toward the throned man. His mouth may open slightly.</illusobjdesc>
