Jesus's body is laid on a wooden bier. The ends of the bier are curved so that it resembles a scroll. There may be a pillow under Jesus's head. Jesus's body is laid, supine, on a bier. He has short, curly hair and a beard. He still wears the crown of thorns. His eyes are closed and he is partly clothed with a loincloth. Blood indicates the wound on the left side of his chest. Following and to the right of Jesus's bier are three female figures. The leftmost figure in the group is the Virgin Mary, who walks, facing left. Her head is slightly bowed, though she looks ahead of her. There are indications of long hair under her long veil. She wears a gown. Her arms are bent, with her hands together, as if in prayer. The middle figure in this group also wears a gown and faces left, though she faces slightly forward and down as well. She is probably one of the two women named Mary also associated with Christ's crucifixion, either Mary Magdalene or the Mary referred to variously as the wife of Cleophas, Mary the Mother of James, and Mary the sister of Joseph. She has long hair and wears a gown. Her mouth is slightly open and she may be crying. The rightmost figure wears a gown and has long hair. She is probably one of the two women named Mary also associated with Christ's crucifixion, either Mary Magdalene or the Mary referred to variously as the wife of Cleophas, Mary the Mother of James, and Mary the sister of Joseph. She walks, facing left and slightly down, with her arms bent upward and her hands clenched under her chin. She may be praying. He bare left foot is visible below the hem of her gown. Four pallbearers, probably disciples, carry Jesus's bier on their shoulders. Only the right(?) foot, part of the body, and the lower half of the face of the leftmost pallbearer is visible. He is gowned and may have long, curly hair. The pallbearer second from the left faces left, and is similarly gowned, with long, curly hair. His visible arm is at his side and in his hand he holds an urn which has handles. His left foot is pictured. Between the two groups of pallbearers is an old man, with long hair and a beard. He may be Joseph of Arimathea. He faces left and slightly forward, holding a walking stick in his right hand. His left arm is at his side and in that hand he holds an urn with a lid. He wears a sandal on his left foot. Only a portion of the body and the beard of the pallbearer second from the right is visible. He wears a gown. The rightmost pallbearer wears a gown and holds an urn by its handle in his lowered left hand. His left arm is at his side. He has a beard and faces left, looking down slightly. The ground is covered with grass and in the middle distance are leafy trees. The sky is slightly cloudy. To the left of the Virgin Mary, on the hill of Calvary in the background, are three crosses. Between and to the left of each of the sets of pallbearers, a city is visible in the background. Spires, domes, walls, and columns are pictured. The architecture includes both classical and Gothic elements, including a pointed arch on the right. The dome and spires suggest a temple and one or more churches. This is probably an imaginative representation of Jerusalem.
