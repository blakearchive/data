    The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of thirty-three of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible.  All take their subjects from the New Testament and have been added to the twenty Old Testament subjects published in March 2010 as “Illustrations to the Bible, c. 1780-1824,” under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.  This new group is presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).
                <lb/><lb/>
                   Blake executed most of these New Testament water colors c. 1800-05 for his patron Thomas Butts.  The exceptions are <hi rend="i">The Whore of Babylon</hi> of 1809 and <hi rend="i">The Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins</hi> in the Yale Center for British Art, datable to c. 1825. The subjects range from the childhood of Jesus to his ascension, the later history of his parents and one of his major followers, St. Paul, and a group of eight designs based on the Book of Revelation.  While the illustrations of the life of Christ are fairly conventional in their subjects, in part because of the long tradition of picturing almost every event in the Gospels, individual motifs recall designs in Blake’s illuminated books and thus offer a window on Blake’s visual interpretation of the Bible. The illustrations of Revelation complement Blake’s intense engagement with apocalyptic events and images in his own poetry.
                    <lb/><lb/>
                        The selection of fifty-three biblical water colors now available in the Archive will be supplemented in the future with early works, such as <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>, datable to c. 1780, and will continue through Blake’s final biblical water colors, such as <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi>. 
                    <lb/><lb/>

In the center of the design stands Jesus, facing away but turned slightly right. He is mostly nude, though he has a loincloth around his waist. His left leg is bent and extended backward slightly as his left foot is on tiptoe. He has long, curly hair and a beard and bends his arms upward with his palms together as if in prayer or supplication. He may have a halo-like aura of light around his head. To the right of Jesus, and baptizing him, stands John the Baptist, facing left in profile and slightly forward, but looking up with his mouth open. He may be praying, speaking, or blessing. He has long, curly hair and a beard and wears a furry animal skin like a toga. His left arm is bent at his side with his index and middle fingers on his left hand raised as though pointing. His right arm is raised at 135 degrees and from it he pours water onto Jesus's head. His right leg is bent and extended backward as his right foot is on tiptoe. To the right of John the Baptist kneel two female figures facing left, both probably gowned with long hair. The leftmost female has her arms bent upward and her hands together as if in prayer or supplication, though she looks down. Her mouth may be open. She may be praying. Only the head and back of the rightmost female is visible. She may have her eyes closed. 
  To the left of Jesus kneels a group of six figures, facing right. Only the top of the head of the leftmost figure is visible, with long hair, though a gown may be partly visible along the lower left margin of the design. The second figure from the left in this group of kneeling figures is that of a gowned female with long hair pulled up into a bun. She wears a gold band in her hair. The third figure from the left is a gowned female with long, slightly curly hair. She bends her right arm upward and holds it to her chest. Her head faces slightly forward. The fourth figure from the left in this group is an old man with long hair and a beard. He looks down but bends his arms upward with his palms together as though in prayer or supplication. The fifth figure from the left in this group is gowned but of indeterminable gender. The sixth figure from the left is a nude or mostly nude male, who may have a strip of cloth covering his genitals. He has long hair and bends one leg underneath him, drawing the right knee up. He bends his right arm upward around his head and faces slightly forward. His facial expression suggests pain or despair.
  On the left of the group of kneeling figures stands a gowned female, facing left and away, but looking up and to the right. Her left arm is at her side and her left leg is extended backward and on tiptoe, perhaps to suggest that she is walking. She has long, slightly curly hair that spirals to the right. Jesus, John the Baptist, and nine other figures stand or kneel in the Jordan River. On either side of the river in the background rise small mountains or large hills, dotted with indeterminate leafy vegetation. The riverbanks are sandy. The sky in the background is slightly cloudy. 
  In the top center of the design is the dove of the Holy Ghost, seen from behind and facing down, perhaps flying downward. Its wings are spread and it has an aura of light and beams of light emanating from it. To the right and left of the dove hover gowned and winged angels, most likely all male. There are at least ten angels to the left and seven to the right. They may all be looking at Jesus. The angels on the left of the design face right and slightly forward, as well as down. The first and fourth angels from the left have long hair, while the second and third from the left have short, curly hair. Their mouths may be open. They may be speaking, singing and/or praying. The second and fourth angels from the left hold (and presumably play) tambourines; the third angel from the left hands and plays a lyre. The angels on the right of the design face left and slightly forward as well as down. The rearmost angel as well as the first and second from the right have long hair, while the second and third from the left have short, curly hair. The third angel from the left may have his mouth open, while the middle angel may be smiling. The fourth angel from the left holds and plays a lyre; the second angel from the right holds and probably plays a tambourine. Beams of light as well as clouds surround the angels.
