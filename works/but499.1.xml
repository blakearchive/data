      <seriesstmt>The William Blake Archive</seriesstmt>
      <updatestmt>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of thirty-three of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible.  All take their subjects from the New Testament and have been added to the twenty Old Testament subjects published in March 2010 as “Illustrations to the Bible, c. 1780-1824,” under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.  This new group is presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).
        
        <lb/>
        <lb/>
        Blake executed most of these New Testament water colors c. 1800-05 for his patron Thomas Butts.  The exceptions are 
        <hi rend="i">The Whore of Babylon</hi>
        of 1809 and 
        <hi rend="i">The Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins</hi>
        in the Yale Center for British Art, datable to c. 1825. The subjects range from the childhood of Jesus to his ascension, the later history of his parents and one of his major followers, St. Paul, and a group of eight designs based on the Book of Revelation.  While the illustrations of the life of Christ are fairly conventional in their subjects, in part because of the long tradition of picturing almost every event in the Gospels, individual motifs recall designs in Blake’s illuminated books and thus offer a window on Blake’s visual interpretation of the Bible. The illustrations of Revelation complement Blake’s intense engagement with apocalyptic events and images in his own poetry.
          
        <lb/>
        <lb/>
        The selection of fifty-three biblical water colors now available in the Archive will be supplemented in the future with early works, such as 
        <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>
        , datable to c. 1780, and will continue through Blake’s final biblical water colors, such as 
        <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi>
        .

          <illusobjdesc>The design is based on Matthew 27:66, the sealing of Christ's tomb. Toward the top center stands a partly nude male on a ladder. He wears pants and sandals, but has no shirt on. He has short, curly hair and holds a trowel in his right hand and a piece of wood with mortar on it with his left hand. His right arm is raised at 45 degrees but bent upward and his left arm is raised at 45 degrees and bent slightly. He faces away and looks to the right. His left leg is bent as he climbs or balances on the ladder. A wooden ladder scales the center of the design. To the left of the ladder stand five male figures. The leftmost figure is that of a guardian soldier with a beard. He wears a plumed helmet and a cloak, and faces left and down. The second-to-left figure is that of a guardian soldier, facing forward and to the right. He wears a plumed helmet and armor with a cloak over it. His right arm is bent upward and with that hand he holds a halberd (a battle ax with a long handle). The middle figure of this group is another soldier with a plumed helmet. He is only visible as a head, facing away and to the left. The second-to-right figure is gowned and faces away. Hebrew letters adorn the hem of his gown (see the textual transcription). He has long hair and bends his right arm upward to point. The rightmost figure of this group is an old man with a long beard, facing forward and to the left. He wears a gown as well as a hat that is adorned with Hebrew letters; see the textual transcription.  He is probably a priest. His mouth is open (he is probably speaking) and he bends his right arm upward to point. His left arm is at his side, palm down. To the right of the ladder stand three male figures. The leftmost figure has short, curly hair and wears a gown. He faces away, with his left arm bent and his right arm raised vertically, pointing with his right hand. His right leg is bent and on tiptoe. He may be looking at the work of the mason. The middle figure is a guardian soldier wearing a plumed helmet and a cloak. His left arm is bent upward, and his right arm is bent so that he can hold a halberd with his right hand. His right leg is bent and crossed over the left, and on tiptoe. He faces forward and to the left, looking up. The rightmost figure is that of a guardian soldier wearing a plumed helmet and a cloak. He may hold the long spear that rises above him. He has a beard and faces forward and looks up to the left. This scene takes place in front of the stone wall of Christ's tomb, the arched doorway of which is being sealed.

            <note>These Hebrew letters are written on the headband or phylactery of the bearded man standing immediately to the left of the ladder.  The inscription, reading right to left, can be translated as &quot;and he sealed up the place.&quot;  The third (final) word, &quot;תיב,&quot; can be transliterated as &quot;bayit&quot; and means &quot;house&quot; in normative Hebrew.  In this context, it would appear to take on a more general meaning of &quot;place&quot; or even the &quot;sepulchre&quot; of the passage illustrated, Matthew 27:66 in the King James Bible.</note></l>

            <note>These Hebrew letters are written on the hem of the gown worn by the figure seen from behind and standing left of the ladder.  The first four words, reading right to left, can be translated as &quot;they are in the chaff scattered by the wind.&quot;  The phrase is similar to several passages in the King James Bible; see particularly Job 21:18, Psalms 1:4 and 35:5, and Isaiah 17:13.  The first letter of the second word might be a kaph (כ), in which case the meaning would be &quot;they are like the chaff&quot; rather than &quot;they are in the chaff.&quot;  The third letter in the fourth word looks like a tav (ת), but that would not spell a word.  We are uncertain about the letters of the fifth (final) word; one or more letters may be within the fold in the man's garment between the second and third letters.  The first letter might be a daleth (ד) or a vav (ו).  The second letter is unclear; our selection of a bet (ב) is highly speculative.  None of these possible combinations of letters spells a word.</note></l>
