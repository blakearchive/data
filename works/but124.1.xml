  <updatestmt> 
The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of a digital edition of forty-seven monochrome wash drawings created by Blake between c. 1774 and c. 1786.  
<lb/>
<lb/>
The use of monochrome washes to tint a pencil or pen and ink drawing offered eighteenth-century artists several advantages. They could register gradations in tone, from the white of the untouched paper to jet black, without the more time-consuming use of actual colors. No further work was required if the wash drawing was intended as a preliminary for an uncolored engraving. A monochrome wash could also be used to underlie subsequent applications of water colors, thereby darkening selected areas to create the illusion of depth or cast motifs in shadow.  
<lb/>
<lb/>
As the works presented here show, Blake made full use of monochrome washes from his earliest years as an artist. When assigned by his engraving master, James Basire, to record tombs in Westminster Abbey c. 1774-75, Blake applied black and gray washes to tint many of his drawings (Objects 1-5). These carefully executed works could then be used as preliminaries for subsequent engravings by Basire’s workshop.
<lb/>
<lb/>
Blake’s monochrome washes during his first decade as an independent artist and engraver include several interrelated groups. The seven drawings of figures from Michelangelo’s Sistine ceiling (Objects 37-43) demonstrate how copying engravings of works by Renaissance masters helped Blake learn postures and gestures he would later use in his own compositions. Other drawings provide visual evidence of how Blake developed a design from early sketches to highly finished water colors or engravings. The recto/verso drawings, <hi rend="i">Two Sketches for “Joseph Making Himself Known to His Brethren”</hi> (Objects 34 and 35), are preliminaries for the finished water color in the Fitzwilliam Museum, one of three illustrations of the biblical story of Joseph that are among Blake’s finest pictorial works of the 1780s. The three Joseph water colors are in the Archive along with a water color preliminary for <hi rend="i">Joseph Ordering Simeon to be Bound</hi>. The evolution of one of Blake’s earliest original book illustrations, a frontispiece for Thomas Commins’ <hi rend="i">Elegy Set to Music</hi> of 1786, can be traced through three variant wash drawings (Objects 45-47) and a pencil sketch also in the Archive. The four wash versions of <hi rend="i">The Good Farmer</hi> reproduced here (Objects 16-19), in addition to two pen and ink drawings of the subject previously added to the Archive, show the complex ways Blake played variations on a theme as he worked toward a final version. No such finished work is known, and thus these drawings are our only record of Blake’s engagement with this subject. Similarly, for <hi rend="i">War Unchained by an Angel, Fire, Pestilence, and Famine Following</hi>, an untraced work Blake exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1784, we have only a preliminary study (Object 6).
<lb/>
<lb/>
Blake’s illustrations to his poem <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> of c. 1789 are among his most accomplished monochrome wash drawings. These have been published in the Archive as an independent group coordinated with the <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> manuscript.

                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>The general theme and subject of this composition were probably influenced by several biblical passages, including Ruth 2:1-17, I Samuel 12:16-19, and Matthew 9:38.  This monochrome wash drawing depicts a gathering of people of different
                        ages, male and female, separated into different groups, but all of them are
                        in a field. The figures with the most details are in the foreground, while
                        those in the background are more sketched, holding no discernable features.
                        The largest of the background group is a collection of five figures, whom
                        all besides one are raising their arms (the other figure has their arms down
                        and out as they bend, as if to move away) to a figure descending from the
                        storm clouds above them. The figure is possibly sending out a bolt of
                        lightning as they reach toward the crowd. Opposite of this crowd are two
                        figures huddled together with their arms curled against their chest,
                        possibly walking away from the event. They are also walking toward the
                        figure standing even further to the left. The figure might be wearing a
                        cloak, and is watching the scene play out from afar. On top of the hill
                        closest to these three there is a building, likely a barn. The man in the
                        center foreground, probably Christ, is bearded with curly hair. He is standing and
                        looking down at the group of figures to the left of the piece while his arms
                        are gesturing to the field of what might be wheat beside him. He is wearing
                        a multiple layered robe, the outer layer pinned or tied at the shoulders so
                        the fabric cascades down around his arms and front like a smock. There is
                        another older male to the right of the central figure. His hair and beard
                        are long and curly. He holds his arms up with his hands held closely
                        together. He seems to be wearing a long cloak that pools on the ground above
                        his long-sleeve robes. To the left of the central male figure are about nine
                        people: seven adults of varying ages, a child, and an infant. The two
                        figures closest to the male are a kneeling woman who has a young child of
                        indeterminable gender huddled against her knees. Her arm is down at her side
                        to support the child, and her eyes are raised toward the central male
                        figure. The child sits on their side with their legs curled up. Both she and
                        the child have long hair that falls down their backs. The figure kneeling
                        beside them is almost entirely obscured, save for a head of curly hair and
                        their hands, which are held with fingers clasped together as if to plead or
                        to pray. Due to the length of his hair, it is possible the figure is male.
                        There is another male figure beside them has his eyes turned up to look at
                        the central male figure. Behind them is an elderly male with a long beard
                        that has his shoulders hunched over as he supports himself with a walking
                        stick that he holds in his right hand. His eyes are closed. Standing beside
                        him is a woman wearing a wimple, her curly hair poking out and resting
                        across her forehead. She is carrying an infant in her arms. Her eyes are
                        closed or her face is bowed slightly as she turns toward the old man and the
                        other members of the gathering. The infant has curly hair and is turned away
                        from the viewer. Next to the woman carrying the infant is possibly a couple.
                        One figure has short curly hair and the start of a beard (though it might be
                        because of the shading on his face). He has his arms crossed as he looks to
                        the right, possibly over at the background group. The other figure might be
                        female, though her face is partially warped. She has long hair, and is
                        turned away as she waves one of her hands up while her other hand rests over
                        her chest.</illusobjdesc>
