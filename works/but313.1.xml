                    all the other color printed drawings; the coloring of the human figures and the horse is clearly unfinished.  The print was probably a trial effort at planographic color printing and may have preceded all the other color printed drawings (or at least all those printed planographically) in date of composition and printing.</p><p>"Pity" illustrates lines from Shakespeare's *Macbeth*, Act 1, Scene 7: "And Pity, like a naked new-born babe,/ Striding the blast, or heav'n's cherubin hors'd/ Upon the sightless couriers of the air...."  The closed eye of the horse suggests that Blake has transposed sightlessness from the observer (one who cannot see the wind) to the observed (blind horses).  The design would seem to be a positive image of compassion, but some of Blake's writings of the 1790s indicate that it is only the useless product of a fallen condition.  As he writes in "The Human Abstract" in "Songs of Experience," "Pity would be no more,/ If we did not make somebody Poor" (Erdman page 27).</p><p>The coloring on the human figures and on the horse is clearly unfinished.</p></objnote><objsize>19.7 x 27.5 cm.</objsize><windowsize width="600" height="550"/></physdesc><related objectid="but310.1.cprint.01"/><related objectid="but311.1.cprint.01"/><related objectid="but312.1.cprint.01"/><illusdesc><illustration type="plate" location="E"><illusobjdesc>Two figures, one of whom holds a baby, ride back-to-back on a horse and soar above a supine woman below.  The horse extends at least one front leg, and both hind legs, horizontally in a posture suggestive of leaping, striding, or flying.  The horse's mouth is open; a rein extends from it toward the horse's neck.  Its mane flies forward and its tail streams backward and up.  The front-most figure, one of Shakespeare's "cherubin" (angels), wears a gown that covers her lower body, sits on the horse with her right leg drawn up, but turns her upper body to face the viewer.  With both of her arms, she reaches down to hold the child, who stands with his right foot on the fingertips of her left hand.  With her right hand she supports the child.  Her flame-like hair stands on end, angled to the left.  She may be looking down toward the woman lying below, or perhaps toward the child.  The child faces away from the viewer, but bends its head and body backwards to look up towards the female who holds him.  The child’s right leg is extended down and back; its left leg is not pictured.  Its arms are raised horizontally (or between the horizontal and 135 degrees).  Behind the front-most female figure, and facing away from the viewer, is another figure of uncertain gender (more likely male than female?) with semi-long hair.  This figure’s upper body is nude, but the drapery streaming out behind him suggests that a gown covers his lower body.  His arms are extended horizontally with the left palm probably down.  Beneath the horse and the figures above lies a supine, gowned female with long hair.  Her arms are bent at the elbows and her hands clasped on her breast with fingers interlinked in an attitude of prayer.  Her head is bent back in a limp posture.  Her eyes are open, pupils raised; her mouth is open and we can see her teeth.  The horse flies over clouds.  The woman lies on the ground, which may be covered with low-growing vegetation (grass, moss, or lichens).  Long grass or reeds bend to the right over her upper legs.  The background is dark; this is certainly a stormy scene, and may be a night scene.  Two other impressions of this color print picture two horses, but there is no clear representation of a second horse in this impression.  Uncolored areas to the right and left of the figure with arms extended horizontally may have been reserved for picturing a second horse, particularly its tail and head.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>angel</characteristic><characteristic>partly nude</characteristic><characteristic>drapery</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>hair standing on end</characteristic><characteristic>flame-like hair</characteristic><characteristic>leg drawn up</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>twisted</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>reaching</characteristic><characteristic>riding</characteristic><characteristic>straddling</characteristic><characteristic>bending forward</characteristic><characteristic>arms down</characteristic><characteristic>hunched over</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The front-most female figure in the upper part of the design, whose lower body is draped with a gown, rides a horse.
