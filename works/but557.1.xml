      The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the republication of electronic editions of the Thomas Butts and John Linnell series of Blake’s water color illustrations of the <hi rend="i">Book of Job</hi> and the sketchbook of preliminary pencil drawings for his <hi rend="i">Job</hi> engravings.  These three series were previously published in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).  With this republication, those functions now become available, along with our new Related Works feature giving access to related materials through active links on the work index pages and the Show Me menu on the object view pages.  Blake’s <hi rend="i">Job</hi> engravings have been previously published with Image Search and Inote capabilities.  
      <lb/><lb/>
      With this republication, the Archive now includes fully searchable reproductions of all four series of <hi rend="i">Job</hi> designs, among Blake’s greatest achievements as a visual artist.  Thus, characters pictured in the designs, such as Bildad, Eliphaz, and of course Job’s wife, can be searched and located in all four series.  The Archive’s Image Search menu also includes a great many lesser motifs, figure types, postures and gestures.  In coming months, we will publish similarly updated versions of other works presently in Preview mode, including Blake’s nine series of water colors illustrating the poetry of John Milton.
      <lb/><lb/>
      The Archive recently added a new set of scholarly tools that should prove particularly useful when studying Blake’s <hi rend="i">Job</hi> designs.  These tools, known collectively as our Related Works system, are designed to show relationships among works and individual objects in the Archive. They function at two levels.  First, work index pages now include active links to related materials in the Archive.  Thus, researchers can move easily from any given <hi rend="i">Job</hi> series to any other series.  Second, the Show Me menu on object view pages now includes Related Works in the Archive.  Like the work-level menu, this list includes active links to related designs and is meant to allow study of the related materials side by side.  For example, researchers can move quickly from Blake’s engraving of Behemoth and Leviathan to its drawing in the sketchbook and study how Blake developed his design from preliminary sketch to finished engraving.

      September 2006:
      <lb/><lb/>
      The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of electronic editions of the Linnell set of Blake's water color illustrations to <hi rend="i">The Book of Job</hi> and the sketchbook containing Blake's reduced drawings preparatory for the Job engravings. The sketchbook is reproduced complete and in color for the first time. These two important sets of Job illustrations join the Butts set of water colors and the engravings, both previously published in the Archive. Thus, the Archive now includes all four series of Job illustrations. The engravings are fully searchable. The Linnell set of water colors and the sketchbook are presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (our image annotation program).<lb/><lb/>
      Blake's pictorial engagements with <hi rend="i">The Book of Job</hi> extended over many decades. His first efforts were a small group of wash drawings of the mid-1780s showing Job in his misery with his wife and three friends. Another version of this subject appears among the emblem series that Blake sketched in his Notebook, but the composition appearing in the wash drawings culminated in the large intaglio etching/engraving, "Job," which Blake listed in his advertisement <hi rend="i">To the Public</hi> of 10 October 1793. This print may have stimulated Blake's chief patron, Thomas Butts, to commission a tempera painting, <hi rend="i">Job and His Daughters</hi>, c. 1799-1800 and, about six years later, a series of nineteen water colors illustrating the story of Job (the so-called "Butts set"). In 1821, Blake and his new patron John Linnell borrowed the water colors from Butts. Linnell traced the series and Blake colored them (the so-called "Linnell set"). Blake also added two more compositions to this later group and added versions of these same compositions to the earlier group, so that both sets now have twenty-one designs. The Linnell set led directly to his commission for the engravings. These began as a series of reduced sketches executed in 1823; the engravings themselves, with a title page added, were not finished and published until 1826.<lb/><lb/>

Butlin 557.I states that all the inscriptions were "probably done by the Linnell family."  Their motivation for such an activity is unclear; one could understand their placing a single Blake signature on the cover to indicate the authorship of the drawings that follow, but why would anyone other than Blake practice a Blake signature over 30 times on the cover of a valuable sketchbook?  There is at least a slight chance that these inscriptions are by Blake.  The inscriptions on this recto of the outer front cover might have been written along with the similar inscriptions on the conjugate verso of the outer back cover (Object 32) before the sheet was folded.</note></l><l n="but557.1.penc.01.02" justify="right">WB<space extent="20"/><note>Lines 1-2 are inscribed within an almost-complete circle to form a monogram.</note></l><l n="but557.1.penc.01.03" justify="left" indent="10">WB<space extent="20"/>A

                  Job's family, restored 
and reunited, stands and sings or plays musical instruments.  From left to 
right they are a figure holding an instrument, possibly a double horn or pipe; two figures playing large, raised horns; a figure playing a curled horn; a 
figure holding a scroll; Job's wife playing a mandolin; a young figure holding a 
scroll (possibly another musical score); Job playing a large triangular harp; a figure playing a lyre; a figure 
playing a curled horn and another playing a large harp; and a final 
figure holding a pipe.  If the gender and age of these figures are the same as in the engraving, the first four on the right are youthful males (Job's sons); the figure left of Job's wife a female, one of Job's daughters; two daughters left and right of Job; and three sons on the right.  The 
instruments hung in the tree in the first scene of the drama are now 
used to praise God.  The great (oak?) tree from the opening scene again 
anchors the middle of the design; a sun appears over a distant mountain 
range on the right.  A crescent moon appears in the far distance on the left.  Five sheep, including one ram, and a dog lie on 
grass in the foreground.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="BD"><characteristic>family</characteristic><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>old</characteristic><characteristic>Job</characteristic><characteristic>father</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>playing</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>palm vertical</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>fingers</characteristic><characteristic>fingers spread</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised at 135 degrees</characteristic><characteristic>pointing</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Job's family members, restored and reunited, stand around their parents.

Butlin 557.VIII states that the dated monogram near the bottom of the leaf (lines 17-19) is "in Blake's hand," but that all other inscriptions are "probably by the Linnell family."  Their motivation for such an activity is unclear; one could understand their placing a single Blake signature on the front cover to indicate the authorship of the drawings that follow, but why would anyone other than Blake practice a Blake signature 18 times on the back cover of a valuable sketchbook?  There is at least a slight chance that these inscriptions are by Blake.  The inscriptions on this verso of the outer back cover might have been written along with the similar inscriptions on the conjugate recto of the outer front cover (Object 1) before the sheet was folded.  The first "W" in line 1 is written sideways.</note></l><l n="but557.1.penc.32.02" justify="left" indent="15">WB</l><l n="but557.1.penc.32.03" justify="left" indent="35">WB<note>The upper-right termination of the "W" is extended into a circle linked to the "B" to form a monogram.</note></l><l n="but557.1.penc.32.04" justify="left" indent="12">WB</l><l n="but557.1.penc.32.05" justify="left" indent="30">W<space extent="25"/>B
