      The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the republication of electronic editions of the Thomas Butts and John Linnell series of Blake’s water color illustrations of the <hi rend="i">Book of Job</hi> and the sketchbook of preliminary pencil drawings for his <hi rend="i">Job</hi> engravings.  These three series were previously published in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).  With this republication, those functions now become available, along with our new Related Works feature giving access to related materials through active links on the work index pages and the Show Me menu on the object view pages.  Blake’s <hi rend="i">Job</hi> engravings have been previously published with Image Search and Inote capabilities.  
      <lb/><lb/>
      With this republication, the Archive now includes fully searchable reproductions of all four series of <hi rend="i">Job</hi> designs, among Blake’s greatest achievements as a visual artist.  Thus, characters pictured in the designs, such as Bildad, Eliphaz, and of course Job’s wife, can be searched and located in all four series.  The Archive’s Image Search menu also includes a great many lesser motifs, figure types, postures and gestures.  In coming months, we will publish similarly updated versions of other works presently in Preview mode, including Blake’s nine series of water colors illustrating the poetry of John Milton.
      <lb/><lb/>
      The Archive recently added a new set of scholarly tools that should prove particularly useful when studying Blake’s <hi rend="i">Job</hi> designs.  These tools, known collectively as our Related Works system, are designed to show relationships among works and individual objects in the Archive. They function at two levels.  First, work index pages now include active links to related materials in the Archive.  Thus, researchers can move easily from any given <hi rend="i">Job</hi> series to any other series.  Second, the Show Me menu on object view pages now includes Related Works in the Archive.  Like the work-level menu, this list includes active links to related designs and is meant to allow study of the related materials side by side.  For example, researchers can move quickly from Blake’s engraving of Behemoth and Leviathan to its drawing in the sketchbook and study how Blake developed his design from preliminary sketch to finished engraving.

      September 2006:
      <lb/><lb/>
      The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of electronic editions of the Linnell set of Blake's water color illustrations to <hi rend="i">The Book of Job</hi> and the sketchbook containing Blake's reduced drawings preparatory for the Job engravings. The sketchbook is reproduced complete and in color for the first time. These two important sets of Job illustrations join the Butts set of water colors and the engravings, both previously published in the Archive. Thus, the Archive now includes all four series of Job illustrations. The engravings are fully searchable. The Linnell set of water colors and the sketchbook are presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (our image annotation program).<lb/><lb/>
      Blake's pictorial engagements with <hi rend="i">The Book of Job</hi> extended over many decades. His first efforts were a small group of wash drawings of the mid-1780s showing Job in his misery with his wife and three friends. Another version of this subject appears among the emblem series that Blake sketched in his Notebook, but the composition appearing in the wash drawings culminated in the large intaglio etching/engraving, "Job," which Blake listed in his advertisement <hi rend="i">To the Public</hi> of 10 October 1793. This print may have stimulated Blake's chief patron, Thomas Butts, to commission a tempera painting, <hi rend="i">Job and His Daughters</hi>, c. 1799-1800 and, about six years later, a series of nineteen water colors illustrating the story of Job (the so-called "Butts set"). In 1821, Blake and his new patron John Linnell borrowed the water colors from Butts. Linnell traced the series and Blake colored them (the so-called "Linnell set"). Blake also added two more compositions to this later group and added versions of these same compositions to the earlier group, so that both sets now have twenty-one designs. The Linnell set led directly to his commission for the engravings. These began as a series of reduced sketches executed in 1823; the engravings themselves, with a title page added, were not finished and published until 1826.<lb/><lb/>

Butlin 557.I states that all the inscriptions were "probably done by the Linnell family."  Their motivation for such an activity is unclear; one could understand their placing a single Blake signature on the cover to indicate the authorship of the drawings that follow, but why would anyone other than Blake practice a Blake signature over 30 times on the cover of a valuable sketchbook?  There is at least a slight chance that these inscriptions are by Blake.  The inscriptions on this recto of the outer front cover might have been written along with the similar inscriptions on the conjugate verso of the outer back cover (Object 32) before the sheet was folded.</note></l><l n="but557.1.penc.01.02" justify="right">WB<space extent="20"/><note>Lines 1-2 are inscribed within an almost-complete circle to form a monogram.</note></l><l n="but557.1.penc.01.03" justify="left" indent="10">WB<space extent="20"/>A

toward Satan, who hovers, striding vigorously to the left, in flames.  Also in the fire 
are slight indications of the faces of Job and his wife.  Four angels hover on the left side of the 
group; one reaches toward (and perhaps offers an object before) God's throne-like chair, while another holds an open book.  These figures are balanced by a group of four on the 
right, including an angel apparently placing an object before God.

                  covering his lower body, waist to knees, and strides energetically towards the couple.  Job raises his hands as if in prayer; his wife lifts her clasped hands  
                  above her head.  A ram grazes far right, below the (stony?) seat or bench on which Job (and his wife?) sit.  A tree rises along the 
                  right margin and extends its branches and leaves along the top margin of the sketch.  Two stone pillars form the background for Job and his 
                  wife; to the 
                  left are two grazing sheep.  The sky contains dark clouds, perhaps suggesting a coming storm.  Another messenger, 
                  wearing a hat and holding a staff, strides energetically to the left in the middle background.  A few vertical lines to the left of this second messenger will become a building in the engraving.  A mountain dominates the 
                  horizon between Job’s wife and the messenger.  The foreground, raised into a slight mound, appears to be partly covered with grass because of the yellow-green tinting.

                  Job, in his misery, lies upon a bed of straw, his head

                  She is gowned; Job's loins are covered with a cloth.  A 
                  triumphant Satan stands above Job, his feet resting on Job's right knee 
                  and abdomen.  Satan is nude.  His arms are raised 
                  horizontally; three arrows descend near his right hand.  He 
                  holds a vial in his left hand from which spills either a liquid or

                  probably) setting over the ocean on the far left.  A ruined wall or 
                  a broken cromlech or portal, and a broken column appear in the 
                  folds of the hills in the middle distance and background.  A mountain

               Job kneels (on his bed of straw?), center left, his mouth perhaps 
               slightly open. He has a long beard.  He is 
               nude above the waist; a piece of rough (burlap?) cloth covers his loins 
               and legs.  His hands are down by his thighs, palms out.  His eyes appear to be turned slightly 
               upward, as though he is beseeching his God.  His posture, visage, and 
               gestures suggest pain and despair.  Job's wife sits far left, her head 
               twisted toward her husband.  Her hair is long and her mouth is open; she may be speaking.  A few lines on her face may indicate that she has aged, as in the engraving.   
               Both feet appear to extend from under the hem of her gown.  Her knees are drawn up 
               sharply toward her chest, with both arms wrapped around them.  Her hands 
               are open, fingers spread, in a gesture that suggests she, in her despair, is pointing toward and questioning 
               Job and his fate. If our identifications of the friends in Object 10 of Blake's engravings of *The Book of Job* are correct, and if the friends are arranged 
               in the same order back to front then the three figures on the right are (from top to bottom) Eliphaz (or possibly Zophar), Bildad, and Zophar (or possibly Eliphaz). 
               Job's three friends sit, squat, or stand on the right.  They are 
               gowned and point accusatory arms, hands, and fingers at Job.  A single pencil line indicates a low hill in the middle distance between Job and the friends.  A large pillar, or section of a wall, anchors the left 
               margin. The horizon 
               is defined by dark mountains; above, the sky is stormy, with  
               clouds.

                  Job's family, restored 
and reunited, stands and sings or plays musical instruments.  From left to 
right they are a figure holding an instrument, possibly a double horn or pipe; two figures playing large, raised horns; a figure playing a curled horn; a 
figure holding a scroll; Job's wife playing a mandolin; a young figure holding a 
scroll (possibly another musical score); Job playing a large triangular harp; a figure playing a lyre; a figure 
playing a curled horn and another playing a large harp; and a final 
figure holding a pipe.  If the gender and age of these figures are the same as in the engraving, the first four on the right are youthful males (Job's sons); the figure left of Job's wife a female, one of Job's daughters; two daughters left and right of Job; and three sons on the right.  The 
instruments hung in the tree in the first scene of the drama are now 
used to praise God.  The great (oak?) tree from the opening scene again 
anchors the middle of the design; a sun appears over a distant mountain 
range on the right.  A crescent moon appears in the far distance on the left.  Five sheep, including one ram, and a dog lie on

Butlin 557.VIII states that the dated monogram near the bottom of the leaf (lines 17-19) is "in Blake's hand," but that all other inscriptions are "probably by the Linnell family."  Their motivation for such an activity is unclear; one could understand their placing a single Blake signature on the front cover to indicate the authorship of the drawings that follow, but why would anyone other than Blake practice a Blake signature 18 times on the back cover of a valuable sketchbook?  There is at least a slight chance that these inscriptions are by Blake.  The inscriptions on this verso of the outer back cover might have been written along with the similar inscriptions on the conjugate recto of the outer front cover (Object 1) before the sheet was folded.
