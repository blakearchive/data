                The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel Copy N</hi> and <hi rend="i">Enoch Walked with God</hi>, both in the Cincinnati Art Museum. We have also republished <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> Copy U with a more authoritative arrangement of the plates and an enhanced Copy Information page.   
                <lb/><lb/><hi rend="i">Thel</hi> is dated 1789 by Blake on the title page, but the first plate (Thel's Motto) and the last (her descent into the netherworld) appear to have been completed and first printed in 1790, while Blake was working on <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>. Copy N, never before reproduced, was printed and colored c. 1818 along with Copy O. It is one of sixteen extant copies, ten of which are in the Blake Archive—including Copy O—and four of which are in
                    preparation for future publication. Like Copy O, Copy N was printed in orange ink on Ruse &amp; Turners paper, watermarked 1815, beautifully colored, numbered by Blake in pen and ink, and bound with Thel's Motto as the last instead of the first of the book's eight plates. Unlike Copy O, its plates have a single orange line framing them. 
                <lb/><lb/>
                        Blake included the book in his advertisement "To the Public" of October 1793: "The Book of Thel, a Poem in Illuminated Printing. Quarto, with 6 designs, price 3s." He listed it again in 1818, in a letter to Dawson Turner, in which he priced it for £2.2.0., the price for which Copy N almost certainly sold. This letter is also in preparation for future publication.
                <lb/><lb/><hi rend="i">Enoch Walked with God</hi>, at 17.5 x 24 inches, is one of Blake's largest early designs. It was executed c. 1780-85 in water colors and pen and ink over pencil and charcoal. It joins sixty-four other water color drawings in the Archive illustrating the Bible.  
                <lb/><lb/> 
                                This is the first time that works from the Cincinnati Art Museum have been represented in the Archive. Accordingly, we are also publishing the museum's Blake collection list, which includes all of its original works by Blake, not just those published in the Archive, and joins the Collection Lists of over thirty other contributing institutions.
                <lb/><lb/>
                                    Additionally, with this publication, the Archive has implemented a new feature on its main viewing page to enable users to rotate the image, a particularly salient feature for Blake's texts written upside down or vertically.
                <lb/><lb/>
                                        The Archive has also updated its General and Specific Bibliographies, which now incorporate links to many Google Books.

                                            As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with the University of Rochester, the continuing support of the Library of Congress, and the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.

A low dais or plinth consisting of two steps runs most of the way across the bottom of this design, from the lower left corner nearly to the lower right corner.  It forms a kind of stage for the scene.  Four tree trunks rise at regular intervals above the dais, starting from the left edge of the design and proceeding to the right edge of the dais.  Each tree bears a leafy canopy just visible below the upper edge of the design.  Vines climb the three rightmost trees.  Indeterminate, perhaps leafy vegetation fills much of the space between the two leftmost tree trunks.  Between the three leftmost trunks a distant landscape of low grassy hills is visible.  A lake may be located just below the hills, and a near bank below that.  Wash above the hills, between the third and fourth trees, and to the right of the fourth tree suggests the sky.  An old man, apparently Enoch, is seated near the center of the design, on a kind of dais.  His body faces forward, with his bent knees out toward the viewer.  He turns his head to the right and tilts it back slightly, so that his face is visible in profile looking up to the right.  His slightly bent left arm is forward, and he rests his left hand on his right knee.  His bent right arm is also drawn forward, and he grasps one edge of a book loosely with this hand.  The opposite edge of the book is propped against the folds of his garment on his right thigh; his left hand may also help to support the book.  The old man casts a dark shadow on the dais to the right.  To the left of the old man reclines a young woman, probably one of Enoch's daughters.  Her lower body extends to the left along a bench or couch, and the shape of her garments suggests that her bent right leg may be crossed over her left.  She twists her upper body forward at the waist and rests against a pillow or similar support to the right, visible beneath the old man's right elbow.  Her right arm is down and bent across her torso.  She turns her head slightly to the right.  A young man, probably one of Enoch's sons, rests in a similar position just to the left of her.  Two children sit between them.  The man's lower body extends to the left, but he twists at the waist so that his torso faces forward.  He turns his head right so that his face is visible in profile.  The man wears a long gown and has long curly hair.  His right arm is bent and drawn forward, and rests on the right shoulder of the foremost child, a girl.  The girl's shoulders face forward though she turns her head slightly right.  Her right upper arm is extended down to the left, while her left upper arm is down.  She has long hair and wears a shirt or gown.  The rightmost child is a boy whose head and left shoulder are visible to the right of the leftmost child.  The boy's shoulder faces forward, but he turns his head to the right.  He has short curly hair, and may be nude.  The partly erased head and upper body of an additional figure appears, facing right, above and slightly to the left of the head of the female just left of Enoch.  The couch on which the four people sit extends to the left.  Shadow fills the area beneath the couch.  Two youths stand together near the left edge of the design.  One is slightly to the left of the other, and partially hides his companion.  The leftmost youth faces right and rests his weight on his right leg, which is planted on the lower step of the dais; his left leg is bent forward and drawn up, and his left foot rests on tiptoe on a higher step.  His right arm is down by his side but drawn forward slightly.  He holds an object, perhaps a book, in his right hand.  He is nude with visible genitals and has long curly hair.  The partly hidden youth to the right stands on the highest step of the dais, facing forward, but turns his head to the right.  His left arm is by his side and seems to be bent behind his back at the elbow.  He may be nude or may wear a short tunic.  He has short curly hair.  A grouping of five angels is visible at the right side of the design.  The foremost angel hovers or flies facing forward and left, but turns his head farther left so that his face is seen in profile looking left.  His left arm is down by his side and bent forward at the elbow, and he holds one corner of a piece of paper, possibly a scroll, with his left hand.  The angel wears a gown or tunic draped over his right shoulder, leaving his torso partly nude.  His mouth is slightly open and his long hair flies behind his head.  He partially hides a second angel, whose head, right arm, and right shoulder are just visible above and to the left of the first.  This second angel's right shoulder may face partly forward, but his head faces left and is bent down slightly.  He has short curly hair, and may be nude or may wear a gown or tunic.  His slightly bent right arm is extended forward from his body at roughly 135 degrees and he holds the other end of the large paper with this hand.  Marks on the paper suggest a text, possibly Hebrew letters.  The third angel from the right in the front group of three, who is partly hidden by the other two, stands or hovers facing forward and slightly left.  This angel's slightly bent right arm is extended and drawn across his torso to the right; it is hidden below the elbow.  His right leg, visible below the paper the two foremost angels hold, seems similarly to extend down to the right.  He has short curly hair and may have a small mustache.  The heads and shoulders of two more angels appear together in the upper right corner.  Of these, the shoulders of the angel on the right face left, but he turns his head away so that his face is not visible.  He partially hides the angel on the left, whose left shoulder seems to face away though he turns his head back towards the viewer.  Shadow fills the upper right corner of the design, extending down the right edge.  Shadow also fills the space beneath the foremost angel's gown.  A few odd forms upper right, only sketched in outline, hint at serpents.  There may be a chair sketched in outline just right of Enoch.
