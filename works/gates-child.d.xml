<hi rend="i">moir</hi> effect, in the display of several images when 
viewed through either the
ImageSizer window or in the Inote Panner.
These effects are not present in the non-Java inline displays of the same 
images, nor in their enlargements, nor in Inote itself. 
The distortion, we believe, is a product
of the geometric compression of the image by the ImageSizer and Panner.
We anticipate resolving this issue in the future, but we 
have elected to publish this edition as is since the
integrity of the image data is not at stakeonly its representation
according to some of the Archive's display mechanisms. Users who wish to
verify the accuracy of a given impression are advised to examine either its
enlargement or the non-Java inline version of the same image.</note></publicationstmt><seriesstmt>The William Blake Archive</seriesstmt><updatestmt>
            The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of new electronic editions for two works in Blake's emblem series: <hi rend="i">For Children: The Gates of Paradise</hi> and the revised and augmented version For the <hi rend="i">Sexes: The Gates of Paradise</hi>. Through a numbered series of intaglio plates with inscriptions ranging from single words to brief aphorisms, Blake puts the course of human life from birth to death in psychological perspective. Some of the emblems form narrative sequences; others exemplify mental states and their reification in the external world. Blake etched in intaglio the eighteen plates of <hi rend="i">For Children</hi> in 1793 and printed all extant copies (A-E) in the same year. The copy published in the Archive is Copy D, from the Rosenwald Collection, Library of Congress.<lb/><lb/>
            In about 1820, Blake revised <hi rend="i">For Children: The Gates of Paradise</hi>, giving the work a new title, <hi rend="i">For the Sexes: The Gates of Paradise</hi>, reworking the design plates at least twice, and adding three new text plates at the end (19-21). Plates 19-20 contain brief interpretive statements keyed by number to the preceding design plates. The final plate is addressed to Satan as the "God of This [fallen] World." Copies A and B were probably printed c. 1820. Copies C and D, plus a large group of impressions never collated into complete Copies by Blake but now divided into what are designated as Copies J-N, date from c. 1825. Copies E-I are probably posthumous. We now publish Copy D, from the collection of the Pierpont Morgan Library, New York.<lb/><lb/>
            Both electronic editions have newly edited SGML-encoded texts and new images scanned and color-corrected from first-generation 4x5" transparencies; they are each fully searchable for both text and images and supported by the Inote and ImageSizer applications described in our previous updates.<lb/><lb/>
            With the publication of these two titles, the Archive now contains 33 copies of 18 separate books, including at least one copy of every one of Blake's works in illuminated printing except the 100 plates of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> (forthcoming).<lb/><lb/>
            Also, we are pleased to announce that a Tour of the Archive is now available online. Through a sequence of several dozen graphical screenshots linked to narrative commentary, the Tour introduces users to the basic organization and structure of the Archive, the features of its interface, its search options, and the function of the Inote and ImageSizer applications. The Tour is located in the "About the Archive" wing of the site. Available as the first link off our main table of contents page at the URL above, the "About the Archive" materials include, in addition to the Tour, a statement of Editorial Principles and Methodology, a Frequently Asked Questions list, a Technical Summary, and an updated version of the article-length Plan of the Archive detailing our intentions with regard to Blake's non-illuminated works--and more. We hope that the Tour, together with these other materials, will prove valuable both to our own growing user community and to scholars interested in the theory and practice of electronic editing more generally.

arching toward the left in the top third of the image.  Its long,
dangling branches and/or leaves suggest it may be a willow.  A few
small plants with large leaves cover the ground below the trunk. 
To the right, below the tree's largest branch, is a gowned woman
striding to the left with legs spread apart.  Her hair is drawn
into a bun on the back of her head.  Her left arm is bent at the
elbow and she holds in her left hand two small children or infants. 
We see only one child's head and the right eye and cheek of the
other; a part of the woman's gown, or a separate blanket, covers
the children's bodies.  The woman, perhaps the children's mother or
a nurse, leans over and faces down.  She reaches down with her
right arm and hand and appears to be pulling a third child or
infant out of the earth.  We see this child only from the chest up;
his or her hair stands on end.  The position of the child suggests
that it is the anthropomorphic form of a vegetable, perhaps a
mandrake, traditionally thought to be shaped like a human body. 
Perhaps the woman has "harvested" the other two children, held in
her left arm, in a similar fashion.  A few clouds fill the sky

                  stone, we see five seated male figures, all apparently nude (with
                  the possible exceptions of the figures lower left and right).  The central
figure, facing forward, is old and bearded with hair standing on
end; the others are much younger.  This central figure has his legs
drawn up; his knees are very prominent.  His face suggests despair
or worse.  Immediately to the left, very close to the old man, is
a young man with legs drawn up and crossed at the ankles.  His
knees are also prominent.  His body faces forward, but his head is
turned up and to the right; he may be looking at the face of the
old man.  Although we see only his right shoulder and upper arm,
his right arm may be extended horizontally; he may be embracing the
old man.  On the right is another young male close to the old man. 
His legs are drawn up and crossed at the ankles, with prominent
knees.  His body faces forward, but his head is turned to the left,
with his face pressed against the body or left leg of the old man. 
This figure's hair seems to be long.  Another youthful male sits in
the right foreground.  His legs are extended but slightly bent at
the knees.  Although
probably nude, like his companions, lines just below his knees
suggest that he might be wearing breeches.  His left arm is at his side, with his left hand on the
ground (or, rather, on the floor), fingers spread apart.  He faces
left, with his head bent back and looking up; his mouth is slightly
open.  His hair is probably long.  In the left foreground is the
final youthful figure, seated and with legs extended.  Though he may be nude, lines just below his knees suggest that he, too, may be wearing breeches.  He faces to the right,
with his head down.  His right arm is at is side, with his right
hand on the ground (or, rather, on the floor), fingers spread.  His
hair is curly.  Given the configuration of the males, the setting,
and the compositional relationship to several drawings by Blake,
this design would seem to be inspired by Dante's description of

We can see the supine figure's feet through the lower leg of the

wearing a scarf over her head.  Her left arm is extended at 45
degrees.  Her mouth may be slightly open, and she also looks up and
to the right at the ghost with an expression of fear or surprise.
