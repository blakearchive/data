                                                  bedroom scene. A curly-haired male, possibly
                                                  William Blake, sits on the edge of a bed. He wears
                                                  a shirt, stockings, and shoes. He is facing left
                                                  and bending forward. His right leg is drawn up and
                                                  crossed so that his right ankle rests on his left
                                                  knee. His left arm is extended so that his hand
                                                  rests on his raised left ankle; he may be in the
                                                  act of pulling on shoes or stockings. To the right
                                                  of the male figure is another figure, probably
                                                  female, lying on her right side in the bed. This
                                                  may be William Blake's wife, Catherine. Her bent
                                                  left arm is visible, resting on the bed covers.
                                                  She may be sleeping. To the left of the bed is a

                                                  a window. In the upper left corner of the page is
                                                  a portion of a head seen in left profile, from the
                                                  forehead to the end of the nose. To the right of
                                                  the partial profile is another face seen in left
                                                  profile, but here the eyes, mouth, and chin are

                                                  tiger crouches facing right, with mouth open and
                                                  tail raised. The tiger's teeth and tongue are
                                                  suggested. Shading on the tiger indicates fur, but
                                                  not stripes. It is looking up at the figure of a
                                                  man in a window set above an arched doorway to the
                                                  right of the tiger. There may be a cloth, such as
                                                  a loincloth, over his genital area. The man's
                                                  lower body faces forward, but his upper body is
                                                  twisted so that it faces right. His legs are
                                                  spread and his right leg is bent at the knee; only
                                                  his left upper thigh is visible within the window
                                                  frame. He may be straddling the windowsill in an
                                                  effort to climb inside. He leans away from the
                                                  tiger and his right arm is extended (only the
                                                  shoulder is visible). He may be looking back
                                                  toward the tiger over his right shoulder. Below

                                                  head of a tiger, facing right with mouth open and
                                                  teeth and possibly the tongue visible. </illusobjdesc>

                                                  design upright. Three figures (perhaps Druids)
                                                  stand in a row, facing forward. The central figure
                                                  appears to be male, and wears a hat and ruffled
                                                  collar. The sex of the outer two figures is
                                                  unclear, although both are probably male. All
                                                  three figures wear robes or gowns. The central
                                                  figure faces forward, apparently being led by the
                                                  two figures next to him. Both arms are at his
                                                  side, bent at the elbow, and raised so that the
                                                  forearms are horizontal and extended forward. His
                                                  wrists are clutched in the angle formed by the
                                                  bent arms of the two figures on either side of
                                                  him, and his hands hang limp before him. The robed
                                                  figure on the left is facing forward and stepping
                                                  toward the viewer with his right foot. Its right
                                                  arm is at its side and its left arm is bent at the
                                                  elbow such that its forearm extends across its
                                                  chest. In the angle formed by its bent left arm,
                                                  the figure holds the right wrist of the central
                                                  figure, perhaps leading him forward. The robed
                                                  figure on the right is facing forward with his
                                                  head turned to the left, looking at the central
                                                  figure. Both arms are at his side, but both are
                                                  bent at the elbow such that his left forearm
                                                  extends across his waist. His right forearm may
                                                  extend across his chest. Like the figure on the
                                                  left, he holds the left wrist of the central
                                                  figure in the angle formed by his bent right arm,
                                                  perhaps leading him forward. This drawing is

                                                  figures next to him. Both arms are at his side,
                                                  bent at the elbow, and raised so that the forearms
                                                  are horizontal and extended forward. His wrists
                                                  are clutched in the angle formed by the bent arms
                                                  of the two figures on either side of him, and his

                                             <illusobjdesc>A group of three wrestlers, all nude
                                                  males, appears to hover in mid-air. The central
                                                  nude, muscular male has his legs spread, with his
                                                  right leg extended and his left leg bent at the
                                                  knee so that his left heel is pressed against his
                                                  left thigh. He has short hair and appears to be
                                                  smiling. He looks down and to the left. With his
                                                  left arm he grasps a bald nude around the neck,
                                                  apparently in an attempt to strangle him. The
                                                  central figure's right arm is bent at the elbow
                                                  and he grasps the neck of another bald nude with
                                                  his left hand. The figure on the right has his
                                                  legs spread and bent at the knees. His body is
                                                  horizontal with torso facing upward, but his head
                                                  is twisted so that it is facing forward. He tries,
                                                  with both hands, to release the central males arm
                                                  from around his neck. His face expresses pain and
                                                  terror, and his mouth is open. The wrestler on the
                                                  left has his legs spread, with his right leg
                                                  extended vertically and his left leg bent at the
                                                  knee. His left arm is bent back over his shoulders
                                                  and grasps the right leg of the central male. His
                                                  body is horizontal and facing up, but his head is
                                                  bent back as he is being strangled, such that his
                                                  head is upside down and facing forward. His mouth
                                                  is open and his face expresses pain and
                                                  terror.</illusobjdesc>

                                                  robed female figure flees through a forest. Her
                                                  long hair blows behind her and her right arm is
                                                  pressed to her side and bent upward so that her
                                                  hand is at the level of her breast. Her right foot
                                                  is visible below the hem of her gown. To the left
                                                  of the woman and emerging from the doorway of a
                                                  Gothic building, a large male knight strides to
                                                  the right, pursuing the fleeing female. He has a
                                                  mustache and wears a helmet and full armor. His
                                                  left arm is at his side and a shield is strapped
                                                  to it. His right arm is bent and he holds a sword
                                                  upright. The woman flees into a forest, which
                                                  serves as the background for the design. Numerous
                                                  trunks are visible, including one in the
                                                  foreground, between the woman and the knight.
                                                  Lines and dark wash at the top of the trunks
                                                  indicate the forest canopy, while dark. This

                                                  to it. His right arm is bent and he holds a sword

                                             <illusobjdesc>The page must be rotated to view the
                                                  design upright, as shown here. On the right, a
                                                  crowned king stands facing forward and to the left
                                                  and looking to the left. His right arm is raised
                                                  horizontally with his palm down, perhaps pointing
                                                  toward a retreating figure to the left. His left
                                                  arm is at his side. The train of his robe or cape
                                                  is held by three figures, who are perhaps kneeling
                                                  behind him. Walking away from the king, with its
                                                  back to the viewer, is a robed figure of
                                                  indeterminate gender. Its left arm is at its side
                                                  and its right arm is raised at nearly 45 degrees.
                                                  To the left of this figure are three or four
                                                  gowned figures, indeterminately sketched. Both the
                                                  king and the figure he is pointing at appear to be
                                                  standing on clouds. In the lower left corner of
                                                  the design is a supine figure, facing up. He may
                                                  be a giant, given his size relative to the king
                                                  and the two figures sitting at his head. His arms
                                                  are at his side and he may be wearing a gown robe,
                                                  but his lower body is indeterminate. He may be
                                                  dead; if so, this may be a burial scene. Two small
                                                  figures kneel or sit on either side of the giant's
                                                  head. The figure on the left faces right and
                                                  slightly away from the viewer. Its right arm is at
                                                  its side and it may be wearing a robe or gown; its
                                                  gender is indeterminate. The figure on the right
                                                  faces forward and is behind the giant's head and
                                                  left shoulder, and thus only its head and upper
                                                  body are visible. No facial features are visible.

                                                  and his right leg bent. His right arm is at his
                                                  side and his right hand may be resting on his
                                                  knee. To the right of and below the male figure, a
                                                  female nude, perhaps Titania, reclines. She also
                                                  faces left, has long hair, and her legs are
                                                  together. Her right arm is at her side and her
                                                  left arm is extended horizontally away from her
                                                  body. Two leaves and the stem of another poppy are
                                                  visible below the open blossom. The lower blossom
                                                  arches to the lower left corner of the design, so
                                                  that only a portion of it is visible. Growing up
                                                  from the lower left corner of the page is a lily
                                                  plant containing three large leaves that arch to
                                                  the right and two blossoms which hang over the
                                                  open poppy blossom and the reclining figures.
                                                  Directly beneath the foremost lily blossom is a
                                                  ring of perhaps five hovering fairies, all of them
                                                  gowned and holding hands. This drawing is very

                                             <illusobjdesc>In the central emblem, a male traveler
                                                  strides boldly to the right. He wears a coat,
                                                  breeches, shoes, and a broad-brimmed hat. His
                                                  right arm is bent at the elbow, with his forearm
                                                  raised horizontally and he holds a walking-stick
                                                  in his right hand. A long shadow extends from his
                                                  left foot. Dark pencil marks above and behind him
                                                  might indicate clouds and/or sky, as well as leafy
                                                  trees or large plants in the background. In the
                                                  upper left corner of the page a male wearing a
                                                  coat or shirt and hat stands with his back to the
                                                  viewer, legs spread. He may also wear a skirt, or
                                                  pants with wide legs, held at the waist with a
                                                  belt. He is urinating beside a door, wall, or
                                                  pillar, located to the right. Three versions of a
                                                  soaring human figure—bearded, with flame-like hair
                                                  and arms extended horizontally—with a dead(?) nude
                                                  body in its mouth are located above (two versions,
                                                  the larger figure above) and to the right (the
                                                  third version, seen in closest detail) of the
                                                  central emblem. Lines trailing from the figures
                                                  suggest that their bodies are descending. The
                                                  soaring figures, perhaps demons, goblins, or
                                                  devils, may be eating the limp bodies. This might
                                                  also be Saturn eating one of his offspring. In the
                                                  lower left, a figure stands, looking down at the
                                                  dog sitting to the right. To the right and
                                                  slightly below the boy and dog is a curving trunk
                                                  of a tree, without crown or branches. To the left
                                                  of the emblem, a nude(?) infant, probably dead,
                                                  lies face up with its head to the right, near a
                                                  plow located to the left. To the left and slightly
                                                  above the central emblem are the back view of a
                                                  left leg drawn to just below the knee and the side
                                                  view of a left(?) foot, facing left. </illusobjdesc>

                                             <illusobjdesc>A giant flying devil, goblin, or demon
                                                  descends from the top of the page. It is nude and
                                                  muscular, with arms spread wide—first drawn
                                                  horizontally and then redrawn at the angle of
                                                  descent--and palms down, fingers spread. It faces
                                                  forward and left and in its open mouth it bites,
                                                  eats, or at least holds a limp human figure,
                                                  probably dead. To the left of this figure is an
                                                  indeterminate sketch of what may be a hand with
                                                  two or three fingers discernible. This may be a
                                                  detail for the hand of the flying figure at the
                                                  top of the page. Below and slightly to the right
                                                  of the giant flying demon at the top of the page
                                                  is another, slightly larger, giant flying demon in
                                                  the same posture. It is also nude and muscular,
                                                  with arms spread wide. This figure also faces
                                                  forward and left and in its open mouth it bites,
                                                  eats, or at least holds a limp human figure,
                                                  probably dead. To the left of the lower flying
                                                  giant is a detail of buttocks, seen from behind.
                                                  Below the flying demons, in front of what might be
                                                  a doorway, a gowned female(?) figure stands with
                                                  arms raised at 45 degrees. It is uncertain whether
                                                  she faces forward—toward an approaching male to
                                                  the left—or away. She is flanked by three
                                                  children. The shortest is to the left of her and
                                                  appears to be holding her leg. The two other
                                                  children are to the right of her; the tallest
                                                  appears to have a hat dangling from a ribbon. The
                                                  woman's hand may be on the shoulder of the tallest
                                                  child. To the right of the woman and children are
                                                  two separate indeterminate details, perhaps of
                                                  body parts. To the left and slightly below the
                                                  woman and children is another detail of buttocks,

                                                  doorway, probably of a tomb or grave. He wears
                                                  breeches, a shirt, a belt, and a broad-brimmed
                                                  hat. He holds a staff or walking stick in his
                                                  right hand. His left arm is raised and he may be

                                                  have long hair, and its dangling legs are crossed

                                             <illusobjdesc>In the central emblem, a young male
                                                  strides, with legs spread, from left to right. He
                                                  wears tights or a combination of breeches and a
                                                  shirt. His hair is curly. He faces to the right.
                                                  His left arm is at his side; his right arm is
                                                  raised vertically but slightly bent at the elbow.
                                                  He holds a hat in his raised right hand. To the
                                                  right of his face is a (nude and male?) human
                                                  figure, perhaps an infant, child, cherub, or
                                                  putto, hovering (flying?) in mid-air. We see this
                                                  figure from the back, but with his head twisted
                                                  back to the left. His legs are spread, as though
                                                  fleeing from the youth with the hat, who may be
                                                  pursuing him. The hovering figure has his left arm
                                                  extended horizontally and his right arm extended
                                                  at 45 degrees. Below, on the ground, in the right
                                                  corner of the emblem, is a second diminutive
                                                  figure of uncertain gender. He or she may be dead
                                                  and lies face-down, with the right leg extended
                                                  and arms extended horizontally in a cruciform
                                                  position. His or her hair is long. There are leafy
                                                  trees in the background of the emblem. In the
                                                  upper left of the page is a face, drawn in
                                                  profile, facing left, and with curly hair. This
                                                  might be Robert Blake. Diagonal pen strokes
                                                  (efforts at deletion?) cover the profile. </illusobjdesc>

                                                  Job, sits facing forward, surrounded by four men,
                                                  two on each side. His legs are drawn up and

                                                  side with the palms facing the viewer. The posture
                                                  suggests despair. The four males surrounding the
                                                  central figure all sit or kneel, and all appear to
                                                  be robed. The figure in the left foreground faces
                                                  left and has his right arm raised horizontally and
                                                  bent so that it is pointing at the central figure.
                                                  Only part of the head of the figure in the left
                                                  background is visible. The figure in the right
                                                  foreground faces right and has curly hair and a
                                                  beard. His right arm is raised horizontally and
                                                  bent at a right angle, so that he points upward.
                                                  His left arm is at his side, but bent upward so
                                                  that it points at the central figure. Only part of
                                                  the head and body of the figure in the right
                                                  background is visible. These four surrounding

                                                  visible. The figure in the right foreground faces
                                                  right and has curly hair and a beard. His right
                                                  arm is raised horizontally and bent at a right
                                                  angle, so that he points upward. His left arm is
                                                  at his side, but bent upward so that it points at
                                                  the central figure. Only part of the head and body
                                                  of the figure in the right background is visible.

                                                  She faces forward, though most of her lower body
                                                  is concealed by the blossom; her hair is long and
                                                  her arms are raised at 135 degrees with palms up.

                                             <illusobjdesc>In the central emblem, a gowned woman
                                                  with long hair seems to be falling on her knees.
                                                  Her arms are raised vertically as if in
                                                  supplication, with the fingers of both hands
                                                  spread apart. She faces up, with her head bent
                                                  back; her posture indicates pain or despair,
                                                  possibly indicative of disease. In the lower left
                                                  corner of the central emblem, a woman sits on the
                                                  ground, with her upper body propped up by the man
                                                  to the left and behind her. Her hair is long, her
                                                  right leg is bent, and her right arm is at her
                                                  side. Her limp posture suggests despair and
                                                  perhaps pain and disease. Behind her, a
                                                  curly-haired male sits in profile against the
                                                  lower left margin of the central emblem, facing
                                                  right and down. He perhaps holds the woman to the
                                                  right with his right arm. On a doorstep to the
                                                  right of the central woman in the emblem, another
                                                  woman also kneels, facing forward and right with
                                                  her head bent back. Her body is limp, perhaps with
                                                  disease and pain, and her right arm dangles. She
                                                  is being held below her breasts by a gowned and
                                                  seated female(?) figure behind her, who is facing
                                                  forward. The background building includes a
                                                  doorway and a pillar or pilaster left of the door.
                                                  The sky upper left may be cloudy and stormy,
                                                  perhaps including diagonal lines of rain. Below
                                                  the central emblem, an enlarged detail—head, upper
                                                  arms, and breasts—of the emblem's central figure
                                                  is drawn. She faces right with her head bent back
                                                  and facing up, long hair hanging down. At least
                                                  her right arm is raised vertically.</illusobjdesc>

                                             <illusobjdesc>In the central emblem, a large number of
                                                  soldiers are engaged in fighting. Figures on the
                                                  left appear to be climbing out of a ship to attack
                                                  figures on the right. At least one soldier on the
                                                  left and one on the right can be seen with arms
                                                  raised, holding swords. Elevated above the mass of
                                                  fighting soldiers, a male figure stands with legs
                                                  together on the prow of the ship. His arms are
                                                  raised horizontally; in his right hand he holds a
                                                  sword, in his left a shield. This may be Caesar,
                                                  landing in Britain. Directly to the left and below
                                                  the elevated figure, what appears to be a dead or
                                                  dying soldier hangs over the side of the ship.
                                                  Only his upper body is visible, upside down and
                                                  seen from behind. His arms may be dangling. To the
                                                  left of the dead or dying figure, another soldier
                                                  leaps overboard, facing forward. His right arm is
                                                  raised across his body and holding a standard with
                                                  the form of an eagle at its top. The soldier's
                                                  mouth is open. To the right and below the elevated
                                                  figure, a soldier strides with right leg forward,
                                                  legs spread. His body faces forward, his head is
                                                  bent back possibly with mouth open, and he looks
                                                  up at the elevated figure. His right arm reaches
                                                  downward across his body, possibly holding a
                                                  sword. He holds a shield in his left hand. On the
                                                  right side of the design, cut off by the border of
                                                  the emblem, a portion of an elephant is visible,
                                                  facing left. In its curled trunk it holds a
                                                  trumpet. On the right side of the emblem, behind
                                                  the trumpet held by the elephant and above the
                                                  heads of several soldiers is perhaps a rectangular
                                                  flag. A few lines above and below the flag might
                                                  represent cliffs above the shore where the
                                                  soldiers are landing.</illusobjdesc>

                                                  left of the prostrate figures, is an indistinct

                                                  below and left of center, features a young nude
                                                  woman who kneels on the ground and leans to the
                                                  left with her arms crossed in front of her and her
                                                  hands over her breasts. Her hair appears to be
                                                  long. She appears to be kissing a much smaller
                                                  figure, probably also female. This second nude
                                                  figure is seen from behind; her arms are extended
                                                  horizontally. Her right leg is bent at the knee in
                                                  a dance-like posture and her left leg seems poised
                                                  on the flower of what may be a marigold. The
                                                  kneeling figure is probably Oothoon, the smaller
                                                  figure probably the "nymph" who personifies the
                                                  marigold, as the context of the etched version of
                                                  this design in <hi rend="i">Visions of the

                                                  kneeling figure's right are traces of an erased
                                                  drawing depicting a figure standing acing left
                                                  with arm bent and features expressive of woe or
                                                  jealousy (corners of mouth turned down). A few
                                                  strands of long hair drift right of the figure's
                                                  head. This may be an alternative position for
                                                  Oothoon, looking down on the flower and nymph.
                                                  Beside her a straight tree is loosely entwined by
                                                  a vine. Diagonal lines upper left, rising from
                                                  left to right, are probably beams of

                                             <illusobjdesc>In the central emblem, four dancing
                                                  figures form a rough circle in the sky with clouds
                                                  around them. A few lines hint at a rainbow behind
                                                  the figures. A female figure, the lowest of four
                                                  figures in the circle, strides or leaps
                                                  energetically to the left. She appears to be nude,
                                                  but a piece of gown may be trailing from her left
                                                  leg. In both raised hands, she holds the ends of
                                                  two separate pieces of what seems to be some kind
                                                  of cloth, perhaps a scarf, which connects her to
                                                  two other dancers in the circle. Her hair may be
                                                  drawn up in a bun. Her lower body is facing left,
                                                  her left leg is extended backwards, and her upper
                                                  body is twisted so that her head is facing right,
                                                  looking back over her right shoulder. She balances
                                                  on what might be a cloud. A female figure strides
                                                  or leaps in midair above and to the left of the
                                                  lowest of the four figures. Her torso is
                                                  horizontal and she faces upward, her head thrown
                                                  back. Like the figure below her, her arms are
                                                  extended and raised slightly above the horizontal.
                                                  Her right leg extends behind her and what might be
                                                  part of a gown descends from her waist along her
                                                  right leg. She is connected to the figure below
                                                  her by the scarf-like cloth, which she holds in
                                                  her right hand. The most indistinct of the four
                                                  figures, the topmost, hovers in midair with its
                                                  head toward the viewer or facing left and its arms
                                                  extended horizontally. What might be a long,
                                                  flowing drapery extends behind and to the left of
                                                  the figure. Its right hand is connected to the
                                                  upward reaching left hand of the horizontal female
                                                  below it, and its left hand may be connected by
                                                  another scarf-like cloth to the right-most figure
                                                  in the circle. The right-most figure strides or
                                                  leaps in midair, its head thrown back and facing
                                                  up, its right leg extended backward. Its right arm
                                                  is raised vertically and it may be grabbing a
                                                  scarf that is trailing from the extended left hand
                                                  of the top-most figure. Its left arm is extended
                                                  downward to connect with the right hand of (or a
                                                  scarf-like cloth held by) the lower-most
                                                  female.</illusobjdesc>

                                                  body. Her long hair can be seen above her right
                                                  forearm. Her head is thrown back and her belly

                                                  perhaps female, sits before a bed on which two
                                                  figures are lying. The seated figure faces right,
                                                  with her head down, perhaps kissing an infant that
                                                  she holds in her bent right arm. Only the head and
                                                  left arm of the infant are visible. A rectangular
                                                  object to the right might be the infant's cradle
                                                  or, if the infant is dead, a small coffin. Behind
                                                  the seated woman, two figures lie side by side on
                                                  a bed, facing up. Only the head of the rear figure
                                                  is visible, while the left arm is visible at the
                                                  side of the figure nearest the seated woman. The
                                                  supine figures may be sick, dying, or dead.

                                                  old. His right arm is bent at the elbow and he
                                                  props his head on his right hand, a posture
                                                  traditionally indicative of melancholy. His left
                                                  arm is raised horizontally, as if to ward off the
                                                  youthful figure. He is seated on what might be
                                                  some large stairs, part of a building behind and
                                                  to the left of him. The inscribed caption, "My son

                                                  up on a bed, most likely a sickbed, since the
                                                  figure is surrounded by five people who lean
                                                  attentively toward it. Its head is supported by a
                                                  pillow and in its left hand seems to be a book.
                                                  The figure closest to the head of the invalid
                                                  bends forward at the waist, facing right, looking
                                                  at the face of the invalid. The bending figure's
                                                  right arm is also bent and raised toward its face.
                                                  The right arm of another figure is also seen. The
                                                  heads of the figures descend in height from the
                                                  upper left to the invalid's head in the lower
                                                  right. A few diagonal lines above the figures may
                                                  be bed curtains. Lightly sketched lines below the

                                                  over to the right. This figure may have been part
                                                  of an earlier version of the

                                                  stand outside an arched door, embracing a boy and
                                                  a girl. The man is bearded, has curly hair, and
                                                  appears to be wearing a long coat or gown. He

                                                  girl whom he embraces. The girl's head is bent
                                                  back, looking up at him. Her left arm is raised to
                                                  the man's right shoulder and her left leg is

                                                  embraces and perhaps kisses boy. Her head is also
                                                  bent downward. The curly-haired boy mirrors the
                                                  girl's posture as he embraces the woman. His left
                                                  arm is also raised, his head is bent back, and he
                                                  may be kissing the woman. His left leg is extended
                                                  backward and a garment swirls at his knee. In the

                                                  His right arm reaches forward, possibly holding a

                                                  bent forward. His head is bent back, his right arm
                                                  is extended horizontally, and his left arm is

                                                  hand he holds a dagger, with which he may have

                                                  mark on his chest. Two lines below the figure's
                                                  feet suggests a shadow. Above this emblem, a

                                                  ankles. Its head appears bent forward and rests
                                                  atop the knees. Above the contracted figure hovers
                                                  what might be a gowned female, with body
                                                  horizontal, head to the left, and with her right
                                                  arm extended horizontally (but vertically relative
                                                  to her body). Her left arm may be extended

                                                  old man wearing spectacles. He has a long beard
                                                  and long hair. His eyes are closed or look sharply
                                                  down. He may be blind or partly blind. His legs,
                                                  with prominent knees, are crossed at the ankles.
                                                  His left arm is raised horizontally, with the left
                                                  hand grasping the wing of the youthful figure to
                                                  the right. His right arm is bent at the elbow; he
                                                  holds in his right hand a pair of scissors with
                                                  which he is about to cut the tip of the youth's
                                                  right wing. This youthful male figure, nude and
                                                  striding energetically to the right, is a winged
                                                  Cupid, cherub, or angel. His legs are spread
                                                  apart, as though running to the right; he may be
                                                  fleeing from the old man. The youth's hair is
                                                  curly. His right arm is bent upward at the elbow,
                                                  with the fingers of his raised right hand spread
                                                  apart. His body faces to the right, but we see
                                                  only the back of his head as he looks back to the
                                                  sun rising or setting on the distant horizon.
                                                  Lines of radiance emanate from the sun. A tree,

                                                  or walks facing left, being led by a youth. The
                                                  old man's legs are bent and he supports himself
                                                  with crutches. He is very slender, perhaps
                                                  emaciated. The child holds the old man's right
                                                  hand with his left, leading him to the left. The
                                                  child's right arm is also raised at about 45
                                                  degrees and he may be pointing with his right
                                                  hand. Above and to the right of the central emblem
                                                  is the left profile of a long-haired male with
                                                  mouth open. At the bottom of the page is a sketch
                                                  of the Elohim creating Adam, a design more fully
                                                  developed in Blake's large color prints (Butlin
                                                  289 and 290). Elohim, bearded and old with long
                                                  hair and large wings, hovers over the supine form
                                                  of Adam. Elohim's arms are exended vertically
                                                  (relative to his body, but horizontally relative
                                                  to the bottom of the page), and he reaches with
                                                  his right hand, grasping (and in a sense
                                                  sculpting) the head of Adam, whom he is creating.
                                                  Elohim is gowned and faces to the right, possibly
                                                  looking down at Adam or at his own left hand
                                                  reaching for material out of which he forms the
                                                  first human. Adam lies supine and limp beneath the
                                                  hovering form of his creator. Adam's partially
                                                  formed head, which Elohim is fashioning, is bent
                                                  back. His emaciated left arm is at his side;
                                                  perhaps we can also see his exposed ribs or organs
                                                  below his chest. His hands and feet are net yet
                                                  formed and look like branches on a tree or
                                                  possibly sinews and veins.</illusobjdesc>

                                             <illusobjdesc>Within a small room, probably a prison
                                                  cell built of stone, we see five seated male
                                                  figures. The central figure, facing forward, is
                                                  old and bearded; the others appear to be younger.
                                                  The central figure, and the two figures next to
                                                  him, appear to be sitting on a low stone step or
                                                  possibly on the floor. There may be small windows
                                                  with bars above them. The larger, older central
                                                  figure has his legs drawn up; his knees are very
                                                  prominent. He may be wearing breeches. His face
                                                  suggests despair. Immediately to the left, very
                                                  close to the old man, is a young man with legs
                                                  drawn up and crossed at the ankles. His knees are
                                                  also prominent. His body faces forward, but his
                                                  head is turned up and to the right; he may be
                                                  looking at the face of the old man. On the right
                                                  is another young male close to the old man. His
                                                  legs are drawn up and crossed at the ankles, with
                                                  prominent knees. His body faces forward, but his
                                                  head is turned to the left, with his face pressed
                                                  against the body or left leg of the old man.
                                                  Another youthful male sits in the right
                                                  foreground. His legs are extended but slightly
                                                  bent at the knees. His left arm is at his side,
                                                  with his left hand on the floor. He faces left,
                                                  with his head bent back and looking up. In the
                                                  left foreground is the final youthful figure,
                                                  seated and with legs extended. He faces to the
                                                  right, with his head down. His right arm is at is
                                                  side, with his right hand on the floor. Given the
                                                  configuration of the males, the setting, and the
                                                  compositional relationship to several drawings by
                                                  Blake, this design would seem to be inspired by
                                                  Dante's description of Count Ugolino and his sons
                                                  in prison. Below this central emblem is a detailed
                                                  view of one of the sons, squatting or sitting with
                                                  knees facing forward and body twisted to the left
                                                  so that the head is seen in profile. </illusobjdesc>

                                             <illusobjdesc>In the central emblem is a low bed (or
                                                  possibly a bier) beside which several figures
                                                  crouch. There appears be a gowned body lying
                                                  supine and perhaps dead or dying on the bed. Its
                                                  face is hidden by a male figure in the foreground.
                                                  At the supine figure's feet, hovering in the air
                                                  at a 45 degree angle from lower left to upper
                                                  right, is a gowned and bearded old man. He is
                                                  probably a spirit (possibly even God) of some sort
                                                  or the soul of the dead man. His hair is long and
                                                  he faces to the right. His left arm is bent at the
                                                  elbow with the forearm raised horizontally across
                                                  his body. His right arm is bent at the elbow with
                                                  the forearm raised vertically. The index finger
                                                  (and perhaps a second finger) of his right hand
                                                  points upward. In the foreground on the right is a
                                                  male with curly hair. He squats or kneels on his
                                                  right leg, bent under his body; his left leg is
                                                  extended to the left and bent slightly at the
                                                  knee. His left arm is at his side, with the
                                                  fingers of his left hand spread apart. He is
                                                  looking to the left at the figure hoveringing
                                                  above the bed. Behind the bed is the head and
                                                  upper body of a gowned woman wearing a scarf or
                                                  hood over her head. Her right arm is extended
                                                  nearly horizontally along the bed and the fingers
                                                  of her right hand are spread. She also looks up
                                                  and to the left at the hovering figure. Behind her
                                                  and to the left are what may be the heads of two
                                                  other small figures, perhaps children. This group
                                                  of figures may constitute a family. To the left
                                                  and slightly above this central emblem is a detail
                                                  of a head, shoulder, and vertically raised right
                                                  arm with outstretched fingers.</illusobjdesc>

                                                  a cluster of vegetation near the base of the tree.
                                                  The second reaching arm, slightly bent at the
                                                  elbow, appears to be pulling a child or infant out
                                                  of the earth. We see this child only from the
                                                  chest up, emerging from a cluster of vegetation;
                                                  his or her hair stands on end and his or her arms
                                                  are raised at 135 degrees. The position of the
                                                  child suggests that it is the anthropomorphic form
                                                  of a vegetable, probably a mandrake, traditionally
                                                  thought to be shaped like a human body. Below this

                                                  grasping the mandrake/child's

                                                  hand. Both figures are very lightly sketched,
                                                  particularly the one kneeling. The kneeling
                                                  figure, who is facing forward and slightly to the

                                                  his head appears to be bent back. The reclining
                                                  figure is perhaps nude, facing forward. His legs
                                                  appear to be bent, as is his right arm, which is
                                                  crossed over his left bicep. His left arm is also
                                                  bent and he rests his head, facing down, on his
                                                  left hand. Both figures are on a cloud. At the top

                                             <illusobjdesc>In the center of the page stands a group
                                                  of figures: two female(?) adults and three or four
                                                  children. The frontmost female probably faces
                                                  forward and raises her left arm at 135 degrees,
                                                  palm down. Behind and to the right is another
                                                  female(?) whose head and left arm are visible, as
                                                  well as a portion of her upper body. She raises
                                                  her left arm at 135 degrees, palm up, mirroring
                                                  the gesture of the woman in front. To the left of
                                                  the two adults stands a child of indeterminate
                                                  gender, facing right and pressed against the left
                                                  leg and hip of the frontmost adult. The child's
                                                  (left?) arm is raised vertically, palm up. To the
                                                  right of the frontmost woman, a child of
                                                  indeterminate gender stands, seen from behind,
                                                  with arms spread nearly horizontally. The child
                                                  might be embracing the woman and children on
                                                  either side of it. To the right of the child seen
                                                  from behind stand one or two children of
                                                  indeterminate gender, facing forward or left. A
                                                  left arm appears to be at the side of the
                                                  right-most child. Behind the group of figures in

                                                  very lightly sketched or partly erased. In the

                                             <p>The three drawings of an eagle may be related to
                                                  Blake's illustrations to "The Eagle," the second

                                                  eagle second from the top on the left is similar
                                                  to the eagle in the headpiece to the ballad, but
                                                  this Notebook drawing is not a direct preliminary
                                                  for the engraving. The central design may be

                                             <illusobjdesc>In the central emblem, a gowned female
                                                  stands facing left, with long hair and her head
                                                  down. At her breast she is holding what appears to
                                                  be a swaddled infant, the head of which is cradled
                                                  in her left arm. The caption suggests that the
                                                  infant is dead. Vertical lines behind the woman
                                                  and child suggest a hanging curtain. On the upper
                                                  left side of the page are two similar designs, one
                                                  above the other, of a large descending eagle with
                                                  wings spread, head facing right and mouth open.
                                                  Clinging to the neck of both eagles on the upper
                                                  left side of the page are two gowned figures, each
                                                  perhaps clutching an infant (whose head is
                                                  indicated by a smaller circle) in their right
                                                  arms. Each figure is gowned and upside down, its
                                                  body bent backward so that the legs curve to the
                                                  right. The arms of each are raised relative to the
                                                  body, with elbows bent in order to wrap around the
                                                  neck of the eagle. The lower figure has a piece of
                                                  drapery extending from it. The right foot of this
                                                  figure is also clearly visible. Centered at the
                                                  top of the page is another eagle, this one rising
                                                  with wings and head raised. Its head is facing
                                                  right with mouth open. Clinging to the breast of
                                                  this eagle are what appear to be three figures
                                                  indicated by their circular heads. The central
                                                  figure is uppermost and largest, and appears to be
                                                  raising its left arm.</illusobjdesc>

                                                  left profile, perhaps bearded. Immediately below
                                                  and to the right of the upper-most head is the
                                                  portrait of a curly-haired male, facing forward
                                                  and smiling. To the right of the curly-haired male
                                                  face is a gowned female(?) figure, facing forward
                                                  with legs crossed. Her arms are down in front of
                                                  her with hands clasped together. Her head is
                                                  lowered with long hair falling over her face.
                                                  Below and slightly to the left of the standing
                                                  female figure in the upper right is a gowned
                                                  figure of indeterminate gender, sitting
                                                  cross-legged. The figure faces forward and its
                                                  knees are drawn up to its upper chest in a very
                                                  contracted posture. Its legs are crossed at the
                                                  ankles and its feet are visible below the hem of
                                                  the gown. The figure's hands rest upon its knees,
                                                  and its head is bent forward and rests upon its
                                                  hands. The right-most design on the page is a male
                                                  face, seen in left profile. Only the facial
                                                  features are discernible, not the hair, ears, and
                                                  rest of the head. In the lower right corner of the
                                                  page, A gowned male(?) figure walks forward, left
                                                  leg first. His arms are bent upward to hold the
                                                  hands of the infant who sits on (or hovers in
                                                  front of) his head. Its arms are raised
                                                  horizontally to hold the hands of the walking
                                                  figure, and its legs dangle on either side of the
                                                  walking figure's head. Both figures are facing
                                                  forward. Just below the center of the page is a
                                                  gowned and seated woman, facing right. She sits
                                                  huddled with legs drawn up and her head bent down
                                                  so that it appears to be resting on her knees. Her
                                                  long hair hangs down and her right arm appears to
                                                  be wrapped around her body. Her right foot is
                                                  visible. Her posture suggests despair or grief.
                                                  Nearly centered at the bottom of the page is a
                                                  bearded(?) male, facing forward, with a pained or
                                                  despairing expression. He is extremely contracted,
                                                  and either his knees or shoulders are visible
                                                  beside his face, and his arms may be wrapped
                                                  around his head. The figure is tightly surrounded
                                                  by drapery, an end of which hangs down at the left
                                                  side of the design, giving a "P" shape to the
                                                  drapery and contracted figure. A few lines to the
                                                  right suggest either stones or clouds. In the
                                                  lower left corner of the page is another
                                                  contracted male figure, facing forward, only the
                                                  head and crossed arms of whom are depicted, all of
                                                  which forms an "O" shape. His mouth is open, with
                                                  teeth visible, in an expression of pain or
                                                  despair. Directly above the O-shaped figure in the
                                                  lower left corner a figure of indeterminate gender
                                                  kneels in a huddled position, head to the left and
                                                  legs drawn up. Its head is bent downward and may
                                                  be resting on its hands in a posture that suggests
                                                  despair. Above this figure a female hovers in the
                                                  sky or on a cloud with arms extended and raised at
                                                  135 degrees with palms up. She faces forward with
                                                  her body horizontal, so that we see only her
                                                  chest, face, arms, and hands. Some snake-like
                                                  drapery trails behind her, forming a curved shape
                                                  in the air. From the underside of the cloud
                                                  descends a lightning bolt terminating above a
                                                  circle, perhaps a moon. To the left and slightly
                                                  below the two male faces at the top of the page, a
                                                  gowned woman stands facing forward, legs together
                                                  and arms at her sides, with her palms raised so
                                                  that they are facing down. She is looking down and
                                                  to the right at a child who is lying face up on
                                                  the ground, perhaps dead. In the upper left corner
                                                  of the page a figure of indeterminate gender sits
                                                  facing forward in a huddled position, its legs
                                                  drawn up and crossed at the ankles and its head
                                                  bent down between its prominent knees. The
                                                  position of its angled shins and feet creates a
                                                  "Y" shape.</illusobjdesc>

                                             <illusobjdesc>The page features a central emblem
                                                  surrounded by seven separate designs. In the
                                                  central emblem, two kneeling figures embrace with
                                                  a child between them. The figure on the left,
                                                  perhaps female, has her right leg extended
                                                  backward, her head bent back, and her right arm
                                                  raised at 135 degrees relative to her body as she
                                                  embraces the larger figure facing it. The figure
                                                  on the right, perhaps male, faces left, kneeling
                                                  on his left knee. The child between them faces
                                                  left, has its left leg bent, and its left arm
                                                  raised at 135 degrees as it seems to embrace the
                                                  figure on the left. In the upper left corner of
                                                  the page is a head encircled by what appears to be
                                                  some kind of drapery or scarf, the end of which
                                                  hangs from the left side of the encircled head.
                                                  Centered at the top of the page is a seated figure
                                                  (although no chair is visible), facing right, with
                                                  head down and right arm on its knee. In the upper
                                                  right a muscular, nude male falls head-first. His
                                                  knees are sharply bent and his legs are spread. He
                                                  seems to grasp his head with both hands in a
                                                  gesture indicating despair. Between the spread
                                                  legs of the falling figure is a human (and
                                                  apparently male) head, facing forward, with mouth
                                                  open and a pained and despairing expression. This
                                                  head seems to be surrounded tightly by the
                                                  figure's arms and snake-like drapery suggestive of
                                                  a spiral. The end of the drapery coils above the
                                                  figure's head, forming one loop. Alternatively,
                                                  this may be the body of a snake rather than
                                                  drapery. The caption for the design indicates that
                                                  it is a vision of fear. In the lower right of the
                                                  page can be seen the long hair of what might be a
                                                  beard, though the head from which it descends is
                                                  indistinct. Centered at the bottom of the page is
                                                  a figure, seated on a stone or a mound, facing
                                                  forward. Its right arm reaches across its body,
                                                  with its elbow on the left knee and arm wrapped
                                                  around the head, which is lowered. The posture
                                                  suggests despair or melancholy. In the lower left
                                                  of the page an old robed man stands facing
                                                  forward. He has long hair and a beard and his
                                                  hands are clasped together at his chest. Halfway
                                                  down the left side of the page is a nude male
                                                  figure with legs spread, facing forward but with
                                                  body bent backward so that it is nearly
                                                  horizontal, with his head bent back. His right arm
                                                  is extended horizontally and his left arm seems to
                                                  be bent upward, almost vertically, above him.
                                                  Either his fingers are spread or his arm
                                                  terminates in what might be a star.</illusobjdesc>

                                                  hair streaming out on each side of her head. She

                                                  expression. Her mouth is open and she may be
                                                  speaking to the women below. Flames emanate from
                                                  beneath her chest and curl over her arms. One of

                                                  in a group of three women. Her legs are drawn up
                                                  to her chest. She faces to the right and looks up
                                                  at the hovering figure above her. Another woman
                                                  sits in the center of the group of three huddled
                                                  on the seashore. Both legs are drawn up toward her
                                                  chest, and they may be crossed at the ankles. Her
                                                  left arm extends horizontally to the left and her
                                                  left hand rests on the right shoulder of her
                                                  companion on the left. She may be embracing her
                                                  companion. She faces right and looks up to the
                                                  figure hovering above. We only see her legs, drawn
                                                  up to her chest, and her head of the rightmost
                                                  figure in the group. Her head it may be lowered,
                                                  or she may be looking upward like her companions.

                                                  right arm. This daughter, perhaps gowned, faces
                                                  toward Jerusalem, perhaps holding her. Her visible
                                                  right arm is bent upward. The shortest of the
                                                  three daughters stands to the right of Jerusalem,
                                                  with her back to us. She appears to be gowned, and
                                                  may be holding her mother and/or her sister. The
                                                  tallest of the three daughters stands facing
                                                  forward to the right of Jerusalem, whose left arm
                                                  extends behind her head. The daughter may have
                                                  long hair and her arms are crossed at the wrist in
                                                  front of her waist. She may be touching or holding
                                                  the shoulder of the shortest daughter in front of
                                                  her. To the right of the four figures are what may

                                                  the Daughters of Albion</hi> suggest that this is
                                                  Theotormon. Within a tongue- or flame-like wave is
                                                  a nude female, shackled and chained on the ankle
                                                  of an extended left(?) leg. The other leg, as well
                                                  as her head, neck, and shoulder, cannot be clearly
                                                  discerned. She arches to the left, with her arms
                                                  bent at the elbows and her hands clasped together
                                                  just below her neck in a gesture that suggests
                                                  prayer or supplication. Though her face is
                                                  unclear, her posture suggests that she is facing
                                                  down. She is probably Oothoon, pleading to her
                                                  lover Theotormon. Drawn within an oval in the
                                                  upper right corner of the page is a design also
                                                  sketched on object 6 of the Notebook. A tiger
                                                  crouches facing right with mouth open and tail
                                                  raised. Shading on the tiger indicates fur, but no
                                                  stripes. It is looking up at slight indications of
                                                  a figure in a window above the arch doorway of a
                                                  building to the right of the tiger. There may be
                                                  pillars or pilasters on both sides of the doorway.
                                                  The arch appears to be slightly pointed,
                                                  indicating a Gothic structure. A leafy tree grows
                                                  to the right of the building; a tower or spire and
                                                  three domes rise in the distance on the left. This
                                                  may be a city with a church.</illusobjdesc>

                                                  to the left are a tower or spire and three domes.

                                                  male sits, in a crouch-like posture, on what
                                                  appears to be a cloud. Part of this cloud, or
                                                  perhaps other clouds, extends behind him and in
                                                  front of him, covering his feet. His legs are bent
                                                  sharply at his prominent knees. His arms are bent

                                                  He faces forward. Three round objects just within

                                                  upper right, suggest stars. The dark background
                                                  may indicate a night sky. To the right of this
                                                  emblem is a nearly identical image, but drawn more
                                                  lightly and with different proportions. Here the
                                                  figure is even more contracted; his chin rests on
                                                  his right knee and his left elbow descends between
                                                  his knees. Three round objects upper left and
                                                  possibly a fourth upper right suggest stars. The

                                                  arms spread and legs together and extended back
                                                  and to the right. His head also appears to be bent
                                                  back, though no facial features can be determined.
                                                  In the lower left corner, below the cloud, a
                                                  figure hovers with body horizontal and head to the
                                                  right. This may be Satan, as in Blake's water
                                                  color versions of <hi rend="i">Christ Offers to

                                                  to be spread horizontally, but other features are
                                                  unclear. Directly above the Holy Ghost is the sun,
                                                  surrounded by clouds. There are lines within the
                                                  circumference of the sun, but what they depict
                                                  cannot be determined. Large clouds comprise the
                                                  background of the design. If the identifications

                                                  twisted so that his upper body faces the viewer.
                                                  He is looking to his left and slightly upward. His
