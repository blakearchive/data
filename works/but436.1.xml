            The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of 20 of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible. These designs illustrate the Old Testament and are arranged according to the passages illustrated.  They are presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).
            <lb/><lb/>
            The Bible had an enormous influence on Blake’s work as both artist and poet.  Among his many and complex responses to that text are water color drawings.  The present group of 20 is selected from a sequence of about 80 biblical water colors of similar size Blake painted for Thomas Butts between c. 1800 and 1805.  These designs emphasize interactions between the human and the divine.  In works such as <hi rend="i">Ezekiel’s Wheels</hi> and <hi rend="i">David Delivered Out of Many Waters</hi>, the interaction is revelatory or redemptive.  In other designs, including <hi rend="i">Pestilence: The Death of the First-Born</hi>, the relationship between God and humankind devolves into punishment and destruction.
            <lb/><lb/>
            This group of 20 water colors is the first installment in our publication of a large selection of Blake’s water color drawings illustrating the Bible.  In coming months we will publish a group of New Testament illustrations also from the series executed for Butts.  Later we will add early works, such as <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>, datable to c. 1780, and continue through Blake’s final biblical water colors, including <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi> of c. 1824.

In the center of the design stands the Angel of the Divine Presence. The angel faces forward but looks down slightly. He has long white hair and a beard, and appears to be old. He wears a gown and his left foot extends from under the hem of the gown, revealing six toes. His arms are at his side, though bent slightly so that his right hand rests on Adam's left buttock and his left hand rests on Eve's left buttock, as though he is embracing them or holding the skins with which they are dressed. In front of the angel, Adam stands in profile facing right. He has short, curly hair and is partly clothed by what appears to be a sheepskin around his waist. His left leg is bent and may be on tiptoe. His head is bent down slightly. His arms are bent with his hands together as if in prayer or supplication. Opposite Adam, and in front of the angel stands Eve, in profile facing left. Eve has long hair, which is pulled up away from her face. She, like Adam, is partly clothed by what appears to be a sheepskin around her waist. Her left leg is bent and extended backward slightly, with her foot on tiptoe. Her head is bent down slightly. Eve's arms are bent, with her hands together as if in prayer or supplication. Framing the central figures is an arch of palm trees with leafy fronds. The trunks of the trees are visible. To the left of Adam and to the right of Eve are two pillars with flames atop them. These appear to be altars. The ground may be grassy. Behind the figures, the sky is cloudy and vegetation is visible right of the angel's left hand.  There may be a hill right of the angel's left lower arm.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>angel</characteristic><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>God</characteristic><characteristic>old</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>eyes down</characteristic><characteristic>hem</characteristic><characteristic>left foot</characteristic><characteristic>toes</characteristic><characteristic>arms at side</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>embracing</characteristic><characteristic>giving</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><illusobjdesc>In the center of the design stands the Angel of the Divine Presence.
