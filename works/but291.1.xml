Neither source, however, offers a precedent for Blake's double representation of Satan.  His still human and angelic form, armed with shield and spear, hovers over the sleeping Eve, but his bat-like wings indicate his fallen condition.  His serpentine form coils around Eve's lower body, arches over her head, and rests its crested head on her chest.  Her right hand lies limply over the forbidden fruit.</p></objnote><objsize>42.8 x 53.2 cm.</objsize><windowsize width="600" height="550"/></physdesc><illusdesc><illustration type="plate" location="E"><illusobjdesc>Satan, nude, muscular and bat-winged, hovers over the supine form of Eve.  He raises his arms at an angle between the horizontal and 135 degrees (relative to the ground below) with his lower body horizontal, his upper body twisted upward, and his left leg (the right is not pictured) extended to the right.  With his right hand, he clasps a shield that is fastened with a strap to his elbow.  In his left hand he holds an arrow-pointed spear.  A serpent twines around Eve’s bare right foot, coils around her right leg and lower body, arches over her limp, backward-bent head, and rests its spiky, crested head on her breast.  Eve has long, curly hair and lies with her legs together (?) and her right arm at her side.  Her right hand rests limply, fingers slightly spread, on the forbidden fruit.  Eve lies on grass, moss, lichens, or some such vegetation.  Her eyes are closed; she may be sleeping or in a trance.  Flames mount upward from right to left from behind Eve's body and rise above Satan’s head.  The sky upper right is dark.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>muscular</characteristic><characteristic>Satan</characteristic><characteristic>short hair</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>arms raised horizontally</characteristic><characteristic>arms raised at 135 degrees</characteristic><characteristic>body horizontal</characteristic><characteristic>twisted</characteristic><characteristic>leg extended</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>wing</characteristic><characteristic>bat-winged</characteristic><characteristic>flying</characteristic><characteristic>hovering</characteristic><characteristic>facing down</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Satan, nude, muscular and bat-winged, hovers over the supine form of Eve.
