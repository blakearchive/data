In the center of the design lies a young Christ, asleep on a cross. Jesus is nude, with short, curly hair and a halo (or at least an aura of light around his head). His legs are crossed at the ankle, with his feet overlapping. His arms are raised horizontally. The Virgin Mary stands to the left of the cross. She is gowned and wears her hair pulled up in a bun. She faces right, bending over slightly to look at the sleeping Jesus. Her arms are bent upward, with her hands clenched together under her chin as though she is praying. Below the cross is a hammer and several nails; compasses or a divider rest to the right of the cross. Grass, leafy trees, and indeterminate vegetation dot the background and the ground below the figures is grassy. The figures stand in or in front of an open wooden structure, perhaps the frame for an unfinished building. A body of water, possibly a river or lake, appears in the middle distance with a cliff on its right side. The walls of a building, or possible as many as four buildings, stand on the bluff on the right. There are some spires of a city visible in the background as well.  A mountain range defines the distant horizon. The sky is cloudy, with tinting that suggests a sunset or sunrise.
