                The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of fully searchable and scalable electronic editions of the following works related to Blake’s development of his illustrations to Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>: Preliminary Sketches for Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, listed under Drawings and Paintings, Pencil Sketches; Preliminary Drawings for Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, listed under Drawings and Paintings, Monochrome Wash Drawings; and Preliminary Illustrations to Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, listed under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.<lb/><lb/>
                In addition, we are republishing the following works, previously presented in our Preview mode, to make their designs fully searchable: Robert Blair, <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, the 1808 book listed under Commercial Book Illustrations, Designed by Blake and Engraved by Other Engravers; <hi rend="i">Deaths Door</hi>, listed under Separate Plates and Plates in Series, Designed and Engraved by Blake; and Illustrations to Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, the series of twenty finished designs, listed under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.<lb/><lb/>
                Taken together, these works in a variety of media present a comprehensive overview of one of Blake’s major projects as an illustrator and exemplify his working methods as he developed rough sketches into finished water colors.  The evolution of any one design can be traced via links presented under Related Works in the Archive on the pull-down menus, lower left on the main viewing page for each work. <lb/><lb/>
                In October 1805, Blake was commissioned by the engraver and would-be publisher Robert H. Cromek to prepare forty drawings illustrating Robert Blair's <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, a popular "Graveyard" school poem first published in 1743.  Cromek originally planned to select twenty of these designs for a deluxe edition of the poem.  Blake launched into the project with great enthusiasm, rapidly sketching out his illustrations in pencil, developing some into wash drawings, and then producing a group of more finished water colors for presentation to Cromek.  In a first prospectus of November 1805, Cromek names Blake as both the designer and engraver of fifteen designs.  Blake etched one image, <hi rend="i">Deaths Door</hi>, in white-line, but Cromek rejected it.  The dark power of the print appeals to modern tastes, but was far from fashionable in the early nineteenth century.  In a second prospectus, also of November 1805, Cromek announced that Louis Schiavonetti would engrave twelve designs for the new edition.  Blake had lost the potentially lucrative commission to engrave his own designs; his relationship with Cromek descended into anger and argument.  In spite of their disagreement, Cromek included a portrait of Blake as a frontispiece to the volume, published in 1808.  Cromek promoted the book aggressively and the illustrations to <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> became Blake's best known work through much of the nineteenth century. <lb/><lb/>

Cromek's edition of Robert Blair's *The Grave*, not published until 1808.  It is a preliminary sketch for *Alternative Design for the Title-Page: The Resurrection of the Dead*, a water color in the British Museum signed and dated by Blake "1806" (Butlin 613). Blake began to compose his illustrations to Blair's poem in the fall of 1805, but apparently he did not begin to work on this alternative title page design until early 1806. These very slight sketches on the verso (Object 2) are probably related to the recto.</note></compdate></objdescid><objinfo><numberobj>1</numberobj><objsize>51.2 x 36.2 cm.</objsize><numberleaves>1</numberleaves><leafsize>51.2 x 36.2 cm.</leafsize><medium>pencil</medium><support>wove paper</support><watermark>ITAYLOR</watermark><pennednumbers>none</pennednumbers><framelines>none</framelines><stabholes>none</stabholes></objinfo><provenance n="1"><name>Morgan Library and Museum</name><date>2001</date><dealer>none</dealer><price>gift</price><note>Probably inherited by Blake's wife, Catherine, at his death in 1827; probably acquired by Frederick Tatham at Catherine Blake's death in 1831; probably the dealer Joseph Hogarth, sold Southgate and Barrett auction, London, 7-30 June 1854, 12th day, lot 5082, probably the work described as "Frontispiece to Blair's Grave, *the first idea*," with 21 other works by or attributed to Blake (16s. to "Edsall," possibly a dealer); Richard Johnson, sold Platt's auction, London, 25 April 1912, lot 702 with 16 other works (price and purchaser unknown); Sotheby's, 28 May 1934, lot 166 (£7 to the dealer Raphael King of York); offered by King, catalogue of 23 Nov. 1934, item 31 (£35); the New York dealer E.
