            The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of 20 of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible. These designs illustrate the Old Testament and are arranged according to the passages illustrated.  They are presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).
            <lb/><lb/>
            The Bible had an enormous influence on Blake’s work as both artist and poet.  Among his many and complex responses to that text are water color drawings.  The present group of 20 is selected from a sequence of about 80 biblical water colors of similar size Blake painted for Thomas Butts between c. 1800 and 1805.  These designs emphasize interactions between the human and the divine.  In works such as <hi rend="i">Ezekiel’s Wheels</hi> and <hi rend="i">David Delivered Out of Many Waters</hi>, the interaction is revelatory or redemptive.  In other designs, including <hi rend="i">Pestilence: The Death of the First-Born</hi>, the relationship between God and humankind devolves into punishment and destruction.
            <lb/><lb/>
            This group of 20 water colors is the first installment in our publication of a large selection of Blake’s water color drawings illustrating the Bible.  In coming months we will publish a group of New Testament illustrations also from the series executed for Butts.  Later we will add early works, such as <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>, datable to c. 1780, and continue through Blake’s final biblical water colors, including <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi> of c. 1824.
            <lb/><lb/>

Dominating the design is a large figure, a personification of Pestilence. This figure is male and nude, and covered with scales. There are wispy wing-like protrusions along his torso, upper legs, feet, and right arm. The lower half of his body faces left, while the upper half is twisted to face forward, and he turns his head to look slightly to the right. His right leg is extended backward and on tiptoe to indicate that he is mid-stride. His arms are raised horizontally, palms down. There appears to be liquid flowing from the palms of both hands, probably representing the disease he is spreading. He also has short, flame-like hair and may be smiling or speaking. Between the giant figure's legs is an angel, standing in the background. The angel stands in a doorway, is possibly female, has wings and wears a gown. She also has short, curly hair. She faces forward and slightly right and holds her arms at her sides. She stands, perhaps looking at the giant, and her mouth may be slightly open in surprise or shock, or she may be speaking.
  In the foreground on the left of the design is a group of three figures. The leftmost figures in the left foreground are emerging from a doorway. The figure in the doorway is female. She has long hair and stands facing right and slightly forward. She wears a gown and has her arms raised at 135 degrees, with the fingers of her left hand spread. Her mouth is open, suggesting she is speaking or, more probably, shouting or screaming. She bends forward slightly as she looks at the figure to the right. The middle figure of this group is an old man, facing right. He has a beard and wears a gown. In his right arm, which is bent, he carries a lit torch. His knees are bent and his right leg extended backward to indicate forward movement. He bends forward slightly and may be looking at the group of figures to his right. The rightmost figure of this group is that of a young man, gowned from the waist down, who kneels, facing right and with his head thrown back and face looking upward. His right arm is bent but dangling at his side and his mouth is open, suggesting he may be speaking or crying out in pain. He has short, curly hair. He may be dying. 
  In the center of the foreground is a group of two figures. The figure to the left is a male youth who lies, supine, with his legs together and his arm at his side. He may wear a gown and has short, curly hair. His eyes are closed. He may be dead. The figure to the right is a woman who kneels and bends forward to face left and slightly forward. She wears a gown and has long hair. Her left arm is bent upward so that her hand rests, palm up, on the ground next to the dead man's head. She rests her head on his chest and has her mouth open. She may be speaking, praying or crying. In the right foreground of the design is a group of five figures. The leftmost figure of this group may be a young man, partly clothed with a cloth secured around his waist. He kneels and leans backward with his face upward. His arm is bent, with his hand on the ground, palm down. He has short, curly hair. The second-to-left figure is that of a woman with long, curly hair pulled up into a bun. She faces left and slightly forward, and looks down at the kneeling figure to the left, with her mouth open. She may be surprised, speaking or screaming. Her left leg is bent and she bends slightly forward. She wears a gown and has her arms crossed. In her arms, she holds an infant. It faces left and forward and wears a gown. Its arms are at its sides and it may have short, curly hair. Its eyes are open and it may be smiling. The second-to-right figure in this group is that of an infant, probably dead, of indeterminable gender. The infant lies in what may be its mother's arms and faces left and up. Its head is back, drooping over the mother's left arm, and its eyes are closed. Its arm hangs limply. The rightmost figure is that of a female, wearing a gown and with long hair or a veil over her hair. She faces left and turns her head to face forward. Her left arm is bent to hold a dead infant. Her mouth is open as she looks at the infant. On the left and right sides of the design, and in the center background, are three buildings, each with open doorways and squared pillars or pilasters. Four square windows may also be visible. In the background, to either side of the giant, are large pyramids. The scene takes place at night and thus is dark. The night sky is cloudy.
