            The editors of the William Blake Archive http://www.iath.virginia/edu/blake are pleased to announce the publication of four new electronic editions of Blake's illuminated books. They are: <hi rend="i">The Ghost of Abel</hi> Copy A (The Library of Congress), <hi rend="i">On Homers Poetry [and] On Virgil</hi> Copies B (The Fitzwilliam Museum) and F (The Pierpont Morgan Library), <hi rend="i">Laocoön</hi> Copy B (collection of Robert N. Essick).<lb/><lb/>
            These three works are Blake's final illuminated books, their composition dateable between 1822 (<hi rend="i">The Ghost of Abel</hi>, <hi rend="i">On Homers Poetry [and] On Virgil</hi>) and c. 1826-27 (<hi rend="i">Laocoön</hi>). In the words of Sir Geoffrey Keynes, they offer Blake's "Last Testament" on subjects ranging from aesthetic theory to political economy, from forgiveness to apocalyptic judgment. A drama in miniature, <hi rend="i">The Ghost of Abel</hi> addresses "Lord Byron in the Wilderness" (plate 1) and, more specifically, the issues of vengeance and forgiveness raised by Byron's <hi rend="i">Cain: A Mystery</hi> (1821). The broadsheet <hi rend="i">On Homers Poetry [and] On Virgil</hi> challenges these representative figures of classical learning, with special emphasis on concepts of unity as an artistic ideal, identity, and the destructive consequences of imperialism. There are five copies extant for each of these works, which, like most of Blake's illuminated books, were produced in relief etching; the <hi rend="i">Laocoön</hi> plate, which is an intaglio etching/engraving, is extant in two copies. Through a careful representation and restoration of the famous Hellenistic sculptural group, Blake attempts to return the Laocoön to its supposed Hebraic origins and its allegorical meanings, revealed by the terse yet intellectually expansive texts with which Blake surrounds the central image.<lb/><lb/>
            All of these editions have newly edited SGML-encoded texts and are all fully searchable for both text and images and supported by the unique Inote and ImageSizer applications described in our previous updates. We now have twenty-six copies of sixteen illuminated books in the Archive. Late this year and early in the next, we will add <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> Copy D and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> Copy E. We will also be adding at least six more copies of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi>, two copies of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi>, five copies of <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>, four copies of <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen</hi>, and two copies each of <hi rend="i">America, a Prophecy</hi> and <hi rend="i">Europe, a Prophecy</hi>. In addition, by the end of 1998 we will provide a fully-searchable SGML edition of David V. Erdman's <hi rend="i">Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</hi>.<lb/><lb/>
            In the coming weeks we will also be opening a brand-new wing of the Archive, consisting of an extensive array of supporting materials: an updated and expanded Plan of the Archive, a statement of Editorial Principles and Methodology, a summary of the Archive's technical design and implementation, a list of Frequently Asked Questions, an in-depth illustrated Tour highlighting the Archive's features and some ways to use its resources, and more. Our hope is that these extensive documentary materials will prove valuable both to our own growing user community as well as to scholars interested in the theory and practice of electronic editing more generally. We will make a separate announcement when these materials are available on the site.<lb/><lb/>
            Finally, on our recently opened Contributing Collections page, we plan to begin adding color-coded and linked lists of each institution's entire Blake collection to indicate what is and is not in the Archive and what is forthcoming. In addition to providing a convenient index of the scope and contents of the Archive, these lists should also be useful to scholars in planning research trips.

the top of the plate ("On Homers Poetry" [line 1]).  The cloud—if that is
what it is—on the left is twisted into a spiral shape.  The clouds
right of the heading may be a leaf and vine or branch.  The first
vertical of "Homers" in the heading extends into a vine, as does
the descender of the last letter of "Poetry."  A wavy line, perhaps
a vine, follows line 8 of the text.  The wavy lines right of lines
22-32 might be vines, roots, or flames.  On the left side of the
plate, between lines 21 and 25 and left of lines 22-24 and the "On
Virgil" heading (line 25), we see a tree trunk along the left margin. 
Standing just to the right is a gowned and bearded male facing
right.  At least his right arm is bent at the elbow and he holds
(and presumably plays) a large harp.  This is probably the bard
Homer.  His audience consists of four figures to the right, all
probably gowned and standing.  The left-most figure in the group,
facing left, has her or his head bowed slightly, with the right arm
bent over the chest.  The next figure to the right, facing forward,
apparently has her or his arms at the side or behind the back.  The
next figure to the right, apparently facing forward, has her or his
right arm bent over the chest.  The final figure is larger and
probably male.  He faces to the left with head bowed and arms
probably crossed over his chest.  To the right of this group is a
tree with two branches.  It is leafless (unless we consider the
words above it as its metonymic "leaves").  To the right of this
tree and below the "On Virgil" heading is some grass or small
plants followed by a spiraling vine.  The right upper termination
of the "V" of "Virgil" also becomes a vine with a single loop.  In
the space between lines 33 and 34 are, on the left, some horizontal
wavy lines that may be vines, cloud outlines, or waves.  To the
right are the vague outlines of two (female?) figures lying
horizontally, one with her head on the left and the other (far
right) with her head on the right.  At the bottom of the plate are
a number of indistinct forms that may be hovering human figures
(note particularly the figure, with arms raised horizontally, below
"Gothic" in line 38).  These vague forms are poorly printed on the
left in this copy.  In the lower right corner of the plate is an
indistinct form that might possibly be a human figure with long
hair, bent low to the ground (in prayer?) with head and extended
arms on the left.  This figure's legs, on the right, are drawn up
and may be covered by a gown.</illusobjdesc><component type="object" location="AB"><characteristic>cloud</characteristic><characteristic>twisted</characteristic><characteristic>spiral</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Cloud forms appear right and left of the heading at
