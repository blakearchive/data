To the left of center stands Jephthah, an armored male figure. He wears a plumed helmet on his head and a cloak around his shoulders; the cloak may be held in place by a broach on his right shoulder. He wears sandals on his feet. His arms are at his side but bent with his hands together.  He is probably holding his cloak rends "his clothes" (Judges 11:35). He faces forward and right but looks up, with his mouth open and a look of anger or despair on his face. He may be speaking or crying out. To the right of center walks Jephthah's daughter, a young girl on tiptoe. She has long, curly hair and wears a gown. Her arms are raised at 135 degrees, palms up. She faces forward and to the left and looks at Jephthah with her mouth partly open. She may be speaking. To the left of Jephthah stand three figures. The frontmost figure is a boy with short, curly hair. He wears what appears to be a skin-tight bodysuit or a shirt and breeches. Facing away but looking down and to the left, his left foot is on tiptoe. He may be holding the shield to the right. The leftmost figure of this group appears to be an armored soldier wearing a helmet. He may have a beard. He faces right and may hold a shield and a spear. The rightmost figure of this group appears to be wearing a helmet and may hold a spear. He faces right. To the right of Jephthah's daughter stand three figures. The leftmost figure is a young girl with curly hair and a wreath or garland on her head. She wears a gown and her right foot is visible beneath the hem. Her arms are at her side but bent upward as she holds in her hands and plays a double horn or pipe. She faces left and forward, with her head slightly down. The figure second from the right is a gowned young girl with long hair. She wears a crown of laurel leaves on her head. Her left leg is bent with her left foot on tiptoe, which may indicate that she is walking. Her arms are bent and at her side, and she holds and plays a double horn or pipe in her hands. She looks down and faces left. The rightmost figure is a woman with long, slightly curly hair. She faces forward and left and looks up, with her mouth slightly open. She may be singing. Her arms are raised vertically and she holds in her right hand a tambourine that she plays with her left hand, which is also pointing upward. To the right of Jephthah stand two horses, facing right. The horse nearest the viewer is wearing a bridle and bit. We see only the top of the neck of the horse behind. In the top right corner of the design is a pillar and triangular roof of a building. The sky backing the scene is partly cloudy. The figures stand on bare or sandy(?) earth, possibly a road or path, in the foreground, though the midground appears to be grassy. Two trees, probably palms, with trunks that lean into each other and drooping, leafy branches or fronds stand in the center of the midground. Mountains or tall rocky hills are visible in the background.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="AC"><characteristic>Jephthah</characteristic><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>father</characteristic><characteristic>soldier</characteristic><characteristic>armor</characteristic><characteristic>plume</characteristic><characteristic>cloak</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>sandal</characteristic><characteristic>arm at side</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent</characteristic><characteristic>hands together</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>facing up</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>mouth open</characteristic><characteristic>anger</characteristic><characteristic>despair</characteristic><characteristic>speaking</characteristic><characteristic>crying</characteristic><characteristic>screaming</characteristic><characteristic>breaking</characteristic><illusobjdesc>To the left of center stands Jephthah, an armored male figure.
