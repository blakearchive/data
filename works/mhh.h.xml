         The William Blake Archive www.blakearchive.org is pleased to announce that it has received a two-year Preservation and Access Grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The editors and staff are most grateful for the support it provides as we begin to expand the Archive over the next few years to include Blake's drawings, paintings, and engravings.<lb/><lb/>
            We are also very pleased to announce the publication of new electronic editions of <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> Copies H and I, both in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, England. Printed in 1790 and 1827 respectively, they join copies of <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> in the Archive from other printings: Copies C (1790), D (1795), and F (c. 1794). Copy G, from a c. 1818 printing, and Copy K (Plates 21-24) and Copies L and M (separate printings of "A Song of Liberty") from a 1790 printing are forthcoming.<lb/><lb/>
            The electronic editions have newly edited SGML-encoded texts and new images scanned and color-corrected from first-generation 4 x 5 inch transparencies; texts and images are fully searchable and supported by the Inote and ImageSizer applications described in our previous updates.<lb/><lb/>
            With the publication of these two titles, the Archive now contains fully searchable and scalable electronic editions of 41 copies of 18 of Blake's 19 illuminated books in the context of full bibliographic information about each work, careful diplomatic transcriptions of all texts, detailed descriptions of all images, and extensive bibliographies. They also join our searchable SGML-encoded electronic edition of David V. Erdman's <hi rend="i">Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</hi>. With the forthcoming publication of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> Copy E, the Archive will contain at least one copy of each of Blake's works in illuminated printing and multiple copies of most.<lb/><lb/><hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> Copy H, perhaps the most illuminated of Blake's illuminated books, appears initially to have relied on colored inks rather than watercolor washes for its coloring. It was produced with Copy B in 1790, with plates printed in various shades of red, olive, and green inks on both sides of the leaves. The impressions forming Copy B (Bodleian Library, Oxford University) are uncolored, and those forming Copy H may also have been left in this state originally. But Copy H was sold to the painter John Linnell, Blake's young patron, in 1821 for two pounds and two shillings (less than half of what he was asking for books of similar size and number of pages), and apparently at that time Blake extensively reworked the pages by coloring the illustrations, adding gold leaf (e.g., title page), streaking the background of the texts in yellows and blues, and, what is most unusual, going over the texts in various colored inks, letter by letter, line by line. The results are pages among the most colorful that Blake ever produced and texts among the most challenging editorially, with many key words and phrases visually highlighted (e.g., "Contraries" and "Human existence" of Plate 3 set off by dark ink in lines rewritten in red ink). Such detailed refinishing also resulted in a book with stylistic features characteristic of productions both early (facing pages and plates printed without borders) and late (elaborate coloring and page numbers).<lb/><lb/>
            One stylistic element characteristic of illuminated books produced c. 1818 and later is the frameline, usually one thin line in red or black ink drawn a few centimeters around the image. Copy H has no framelines, probably because they would prove visually jarring for pages that face one another. But they are used to superb effect in <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> Copy I, where they set off each page as a miniature painting. Copy I, printed and colored in 1827 for Thomas Wainewright, was one of the last illuminated books produced by Blake. It was printed in orangish-red ink on one side of J. Whatman paper dated 1825, numbered 1-27, and finished in gold, watercolors, and pen and ink to match Wainewright's copy of <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> (Copy X). It was produced in the same style Blake used in c. 1818, 1821-22, and 1825-26. Works from these sessions include <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> Copy O and <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> Copies Z and AA, which are in the Archive, and <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> Copy G, <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> Copy E, <hi rend="i">America, a Prophecy</hi> Copy O, <hi rend="i">Europe, a Prophecy</hi> Copy K, and <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters</hi> of Albion Copy P, all of which will enter the Archive within the year. Printing plates in full (i.e., with their plate borders), a feature of this late production style, can make pages appear slightly larger and introduce compositional elements missing in copies printed earlier. For <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> Copy I, as well as Copy G, the inclusion of the plate borders introduced the outer lines forming rocks and cavern shapes on Plates 10, 11, 15, and 20, images named in the text but pictured only in these last two copies.

A heraldic vignette announces "The voice of the Devil" 
                  (lines 2-3): three angels blow their trumpets on either side of these lines.  To the left of the text, two of the angels—one 
                  gowned, the other nude—face up and left; to the right of the text, the third angel, also gowned, mirrors its companions, 
                  facing up and right.  A looped, vine- like extension grows from the ascender of "all" in line 4.  Beside the lone angel on the 
                  right, a vine rises from the first letter of "been" in line 4; alternatively, one might interpret the motif as a bird, flying 
                  left, whose tail touches the ascender of "been."  Its fantastic plume contains a single loop, a feature that continues the 
                  vegetative motif of the scene.  To the right of the vine or bird ascends a smaller winged object, either a bird or an insect, 
                  and to its left, three leaf-like flags extend from the "d" of "sacred" and the "h" of "have" in line 4.  These flags may represent 
                  the musical notes of the trumpeters.  Below the winged bird or insect, at the end of line 5, two figures, a gowned female and a child, 
                  reach out to each other, nearly touching hands.  Further down, to the right of line 7, a small figure, its body and arms horizontal, 
                  flees from a recumbent figure on a leaf.  Next to the words "the Soul" in line 10 are seven figures in sundry positions.  There may 
                  be two huddled figures facing each other, although the left-most figure is indistinct in this copy.  The figure on the right in this 
                  group crouches or squats, reaching an arm out to its companion.  They are followed by two tiny figures, barely suggested in this copy, 
                  hovering and facing each other.  They may be holding hands.  The hand-holding figures hover above a vine-like streamer extending from 
                  the "M" of "Man" in line 11.  Next to this pair, three figures huddle together on some vegetation consisting of leaves and/or tufts 
                  of grass.  Following the word "Energies" in line 12 are four figures and two animals: the first animal, perhaps a horse, kicks up its 
                  back heels.  Next to it stand two children holding hands, followed by another hand-holding pair, a child and an adult.  The latter 
                  extends his left arm horizontally, perhaps pointing to the ox which grazes nearby on a bit of tableland.  An ornamental ribbon, most 
                  likely vegetative in nature, closes the vignette.  Further down the plate, two leaves grow from the "B" of "But" in line 13.  A branch 
                  with spiky leaves grows from the "e" of "age" in line 17.  Following it, an amorphous, horizontal figure hovers above a wispy line, 
                  suggesting a cirrus-like cloud.  The figure raises its arm, seemingly in an effort to make contact with the adjacent figure, who 
                  hovers, legs spread and one arm reaching to the left, above a line of vegetation.  To the right, a man walks a small dog on a leash.  
                  The forms on each side of the man and dog may be the stumps of trees.  Facing left, a lumbering figure, bearded or blindfolded, walks 
                  (runs?) in a contorted position, viz., bending forward from the waist with one arm outstretched in front of him.  Mimicking his general 
                  posture, an anthropomorphic tree arches to the left.  Near the margin between lines 18 and 19 stands a small figure, possibly holding 
                  a cane.  Six or seven figures observe another figure one line down (line 20).  With legs slightly apart and arms raised, it appears 
                  to address its audience.  To its back is either a tree with a disproportionally large branch or leaf.  Concluding the procession, 
                  two horses, the second of which is indicated merely by some faint profile lines, pull a figure in its cart.  The hatching at the end 
                  of line 20, colored blue in this copy, may represent water or a cloud.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="AB"><characteristic>angel</characteristic><characteristic>trumpeter</characteristic><characteristic>playing</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>facing up</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>rising</characteristic><characteristic>hovering</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Three angels blow their trumpets on either side of the lines, "The voice of the Devil" (lines 2-3).

                     (line 15) have vine- or flame-like extensions, including the "F" and "y" of "Fancy."  The letter "A" is particularly 
                     elaborate: its looped extension terminates in three curved lines suggestive of twigs or branches.  Near the word "it" 
                     in line 14, a leaf extends almost to the right margin where it touches the tip of a flame below.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="object" location="CD"><characteristic>waves</characteristic><characteristic>spiky</characteristic><characteristic>sea</characteristic><characteristic>storm</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Just above the lower margin of the plate, blue washes and spiky lines suggest a stormy sea with large waves.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="text" location="C"><transcription><lg type="prose" justify="left"><l justify="left">HOW</l></lg></transcription><characteristic>writing</characteristic><characteristic>etching</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Lower left, and mostly covered with blue wash, a few fragments of

Vegetative motifs flank the plate's second line, "Proverbs of Hell."  The grape leaf to the
immediate right of "Hell" (line 2) reappears elsewhere on the plate: below "Truth" in line 16; and again 
above line 18, where it is attached to a looped tendril (both leaf and tendril covered by washes in this copy, 
but with outlines still visible).  Other vegetative designs adorn the plate passim: a long, slender branch with 
leaves or buds follows "contemptible" in line 6; two leaves follow line 14; and some flame-like leaves appear in 
the right margin above "and" in line 16.  To the left of "Enough! or Too much" in line 18 is a small sprig of ivy.  
Numerous figures populate the plate, all of which are concentrated in the spaces following the text of lines 8 and 14.  
After line 8, four figures appear.  Of these, two face each other; at least the lower figure appears to be lying on 
the ground.  A third figure, adjacent to the other pair, lies supine(?) on a gentle slope, which resembles a cloud.  
To the right, the last figure of this group raises its arms horizontally and extends one leg backward.  The second group 
                  of figures—after line 14—begins (left) with a hovering figure holding a leaf.  Behind it is an infant or small child, 
who is followed by a man and woman, as well as two birds.</illusobjdesc><component type="vegetation" location="E"><characteristic>grape</characteristic><characteristic>leaf</characteristic><characteristic>vine</characteristic><characteristic>loop</characteristic><characteristic>spiral</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The grape leaf assumes some prominence among the interlinear designs on this plate:

                     a small sprig of buds or leaves—perhaps a detachment from the longer branch described above—also

leaf graces the top of a few delicate curves next to "cliffs" in line 15.  A double-looped vine extends from the "T" of "There"
in line 20.  And a leaf to the right of the eagle's head hangs from a serpentine, looped vine that concludes the plate's final line of text (line 22).</illusobjdesc></component></illustration></illusdesc><phystext><texthead justify="left"><l n="mhh.h.illbk.15.01" justify="left" indent="48"><physnumber type="pen-and-ink">15</physnumber></l></texthead><texthead justify="left"><l n="mhh.h.illbk.15.02" justify="left" indent="15">A Memorable Fancy</l></texthead><vspace extent="1"/><lg type="prose" justify="left"><l n="mhh.h.illbk.15.03" justify="left" indent="7">I was in a Printing house in Hell &amp; saw the </l><l n="mhh.h.illbk.15.04" justify="left" indent="1">method in which knowledge is transmitted from gene-  </l><l n="mhh.h.illbk.15.05" justify="left">ration to generation.</l></lg><lg type="prose" justify="left"><l n="mhh.h.illbk.15.06" justify="left" indent="6">In the first chamber was a Dragon-Man, clear- </l><l n="mhh.h.illbk.15.07" justify="left">-ing away the rubbish from a caves mouth; within, a </l><l n="mhh.h.illbk.15.08" justify="left" indent="1">number of Dragons were hollowing the cave,</l></lg><lg type="prose" justify="left"><l n="mhh.h.illbk.15.09" justify="left" indent="5">In the second chamber was a Viper folding round </l><l n="mhh.h.illbk.15.10" justify="left" indent="1">the rock &amp; the cave, and others adorning it with gold </l><l n="mhh.h.illbk.15.11" justify="left" indent="1">silver and precious stones.</l></lg><lg type="prose" justify="left"><l n="mhh.h.illbk.15.12" justify="left" indent="4">In the third chamber was an Eagle with wings </l><l n="mhh.h.illbk.15.13" justify="left" indent="1">and feathers of air, he caused the inside of the cave  </l><l n="mhh.h.illbk.15.14" justify="left" indent="1">to be infinite, around were numbers of Eagle like </l><l n="mhh.h.illbk.15.15" justify="left" indent="1">men, who built palaces in the immense cliffs.</l></lg><lg type="prose" justify="left"><l n="mhh.h.illbk.15.16" justify="left" indent="5">In the fourth chamber were Lions of flaming fire </l><l n="mhh.h.illbk.15.17" justify="left" indent="1">raging around &amp; melting the metals into living fluids.</l></lg><lg type="prose" justify="left"><l n="mhh.h.illbk.15.18" justify="left" indent="5">In the fifth chamber were Unnam'd forms, which </l><l n="mhh.h.illbk.15.19" justify="left" indent="1">cast the metals into the expanse.</l></lg><lg type="prose" justify="left"><l n="mhh.h.illbk.15.20" justify="left" indent="5">There they were reciev'd by Men who occupied  </l><l n="mhh.h.illbk.15.21" justify="left" indent="1">the sixth chamber, and took the forms of books &amp; </l><l n="mhh.h.illbk.15.22" justify="left" indent="1">were arranged in libraries.</l></lg></phystext></desc><desc id="mhh.h.illbk.16" dbi="mhh.H.P16" compwith="bb136.B4"><objtitle>,

                  sea creature entangled in the remnants of a net; the scene as a whole is said to illustrate 
                  the text that continues from the previous plate, which describes Swedenborg's self-deceptions: 
                  he imagines "himself the single / one on earth that ever broke a net" (Plate 21, lines 14-15; 
                  Plate 22, line 2).  In this copy, the shape seems vegetative or worm-like.  Beyond this shape, 
                  a hunched figure (possibly holding a book or tablet) sits on a vine.  Following "falshoods" in 
                  line 5, a figure (barely delineated in this copy) clad in a billowing garment hovers amidst some 
                  vegetation.  Below, two elaborate spirals radiate from a common center right of line 9.  To the 
                  right of "further" in line 12 are several large, vivid leaves.  Next to "number" in line 17, three 
                  birds soar on extended wings.  To the left of the long-tailed bird and below the small, nondescript 
                  bird are two swollen vegetable forms.  A loop extending from the "h" of "he" at the end of line 18 
                  coincides with the wing of the largest bird.  Four figures bound the plate's inscription, "A 
                  Memorable Fancy" (line 21), on three sides.  The first figure reclines beneath some leaves and 
                  branches to the left of the text.  The vegetation transforms into loops and squiggles clinging to 
                  the margin of the plate.  Above the inscription, a hovering figure, arm(s) extended, seems to reach 
                  for a serpent.  The four-looped vine growing from the "F" of "Fancy" and the squiggly "y" of the 
                  same word continue the serpentine motif (line 21).  To the right of the text, the third figure of 
                  the vignette stands facing right with arms raised at 135 degrees.  His head is bent back, and his 
                  posture suggests he has just been impaled by the invisible arrow released from the bow of the fourth 
                  figure, who leaps through the air brandishing the weapon.  Behind him, a snake or vine coils around 
                  a tall tuft of grass.  Further down, a yellow flower with leaves and/or thorns adorns the space 
                  following "words" in line 24.  Right of the flower, a flying bird or insect appears to carry a snake 
                  through the air, recalling similar motifs on Plates 5, 15, and 19, although this may only be more 
                  vegetation in this copy.  Vegetable forms follow,  with another large leaf or vine extending horizontally 
                  below line 26, lower left.

would then perhaps illustrate the angel of lines 3 and 4 "embracing the flame of fire."  Next to "Elijah" at the end of line 5, a 
gowned figure hovers, facing left.  A winged figure seen from behind hovers in the left margin between lines 5 and 6; leaf-like forms

is an uncertain shape: possibly the profile of a horse or another figure.  A small horse leaps right above "world" in line 9.  Following 
"well" at the end of the same line, a figure runs rightward, reaching for a small child.  The top half of the plate is dense with interlinear

looped vines growing from the descender of "my" and the ascender of "friend," both in line 7; the elaborate curlicues following the text of

                  him for the "starry" (Plate 25, line 19) and "gloomy" (Plate 26, line 24) king of this "Song of 
                  Liberty" (Plate 25, line 2).  He kneels on one leg and points(?) toward another figure with his 
                  left arm, raised horizontally.  Running amidst wispy clouds, this second figure may represent the 
                  "son of fire in his eastern / cloud," who is named in lines 5 and 6 and in whose direction the king 
                  of the text casts his eyes.  Three lines down, two horses, one of which is mounted, gallop leftward 
                  in the direction of another horse(?)—this one recumbent—and an indistinct form, both of which rest 
                  on some grassy tableland.  The horse motif reappears midway down the design, where two horses flank 
                  the inscription "Chorus" in line 14.  The horse on the left gallops or leaps toward the text.  Its 
                  companion rears up on hind legs, arching its head and back.  A small bird soars to the right of and 
                  above "Chorus," which is circumscribed by vegetative flourishes, including wavy, serpentine lines.  
                  Above line 22, a flock of birds—the largest an eagle with head held high—soars on extended wings.  
                  Various other vegetative motifs adorn the plate, e.g., the looped vines growing from the "t" of 
                  "breast" and the "d" of "accepted" in lines 7 and 17, respectively; a small leaf-bearing branch below 
                  "Spurning" in line 8; and the vegetable ribbon extending from the descender of "Holy" in line 22.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="B"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>king</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>kneeling</characteristic><characteristic>arm drawn back</characteristic><characteristic>arm extended</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised horizontally</characteristic><characteristic>pointing</characteristic><characteristic>staff</characteristic><characteristic>scepter</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Following "dismay" in line 4, a figure holds a staff—or a scepter if one takes him for
