                The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of seventeen pen and ink drawings by Blake. Ranging chronologically from his apprenticeship as an engraver to the final decade of his life, this group offers a comprehensive overview of his work in the medium. Most were created when Blake was learning his craft as an artist and reveal his exploration of various themes and genres. His apprentice drawings for James Basire (<hi rend="i">The Body of Edward I and Countess Aveline</hi>) show his early engagement with medieval art. Another group (two drawings titled <hi rend="i">Figures from a Greek Vase</hi> and <hi rend="i">Charon</hi>) is clearly based on classical art or mythology, responses to which were central to British art and design in the second half of the eighteenth century. The cluster of related sketches on two leaves, each titled <hi rend="i">Four Composition Sketches</hi>, is the earliest extant example of Blake’s attempt to construct a pictorial narrative through a series of images. In these, he began to develop his own version of the sublime, an aesthetic more fully represented by the texts and designs in the illuminated books of the 1790s. Several works from the 1780s show the influence of neoclassicism and take their subjects from two fields of lasting interest to Blake: British history (<hi rend="i">King Alfred</hi>, <hi rend="i">A Woman Enthroned</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Procession of Monks</hi>) and the Bible (<hi rend="i">Saul and David</hi>, <hi rend="i">Goliath Cursing David</hi>, and two versions of <hi rend="i">The Good Farmer</hi>). The three much later drawings are exceptions to Blake’s customary procedures and subjects: a landscape <hi rend="i">Garden Path</hi>, <hi rend="i">The Prophet Isaiah</hi> drawn on a woodblock for a wood engraving never executed, and <hi rend="i">Lady Torrens</hi>, a copy of a family portrait by his friend and patron John Linnell.<lb/>
                <lb/>
                Blake did not execute a large number of pen and ink drawings. This is a bit surprising, given the compatibility between the linearity of the medium and his insistence on “the distinct, sharp, and wirey ... bounding line” as the “great and golden rule of art” (Blake’s <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi>). He did, however, make extensive use of pen and ink work to outline forms in his water colors, color prints, and hand tinted relief etchings in the illuminated books. For preliminary sketching, Blake favored pencil over pen and ink, probably because of the lower cost of pencil and the ease of erasure and correction it offered. The Archive will publish his pencil sketches decade by decade, beginning with the earliest works, 1779 through 1790.<lb/>
                <lb/>
                This is the first time that works from the Society of Antiquaries, London have been represented in the Archive. Accordingly, we are also publishing the Society's Blake collection list, which includes all of its original works by Blake, not just those published in the Archive, and joins the Collection Lists of over thirty other contributing institutions.<lb/>

                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>The general theme and subject of this composition were probably influenced by several biblical passages, including Ruth 2:1-17, I Samuel 12:16-19, and Matthew 9:38.  Christ stands facing right in the center of the composition with both arms extended, at least the right palm facing out to the right.  His right foot is prominent beneath his cloak and gown.  He turns his head to the left to look down toward a group of three figures—two adults and one child—who kneel in the lower left corner of the scene.  The leftmost figure, who is female and nude above the waist, reaches both arms toward the standing figure while a kneeling child leans against her bent legs.  The second adult figure also appears to kneel and rest at least one arm by his(?) side.  This figural group may represent a family.  In the lower right corner another gowned figure, seen from the back, appears to walk or run right with both arms extended.  Many other partial and/or indistinct pencil sketches fill the scene, including the suggestion of another small standing figure (perhaps wearing a gown?) to the left of the rightmost figure in the corner, two figures standing above and behind the kneeling group, and, most prominently, another depiction of the central standing figure immediately to the left of the pen-and-ink version.  These figures lightly drawn in pencil may be alternative positions for the more prominent figures outlined in pen and ink.  Horizontal lines near the midpoint of the right side of the composition may suggest a horizon line or distant fields.</illusobjdesc>

In a posture of supplication, he kneels facing right and rests his left arm by his side with hand on his knee.  He looks up toward the standing male figure.  If this group represents a family, he may be the father.</illusobjdesc>
