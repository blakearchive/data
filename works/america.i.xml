                                                The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of electronic editions of <hi rend="i">America a Prophecy</hi> Copies B and I. Ten of the fourteen extant copies of <hi rend="i">America</hi> were printed in 1793, the date on its title plate. Copy I, now in the Huntington Library and Art Gallery, is from this printing. The eighteen plates of Copy I, like those of the other 1793 copies but unlike those of the later copies, were printed on two sides of the leaves, except for the frontispiece and title page (Plates 1 and 2), and left uncolored. The plates were printed in greenish-black ink; five lines at the end of the text on Plate 4 were masked and did not print, and Plate 13 is in its first state. Copy B was printed in 1795 with Copy A in the same brownish black ink on one side of the paper, with Plate 13 in its second state. Unlike Copy A, however, it is uncolored except for gray wash on the title plate. Now in the Morgan Library and Museum, Copy B has a very curious history. Its Plates 4 and 9, which were long assumed to be original, are in fact lithographic facsimiles from the mid 1870s produced to complete the copy. For a full technical description and history of this copy, see Joseph Viscomi, “Two Fake Blakes Revisited; One Dew-Smith Revealed.” <hi rend="i">Blake in Our Time: Essays in Honour of G. E. Bentley, Jr.</hi> Ed. Karen Mulhallen. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2010. 35-78. Copies B and I join six other copies in the Archive, Copies E and F (1793), A (1795), M (c. 1807), and O (1821), which altogether represent the full printing history of this illuminated book.<lb/><lb/><hi rend="i">America a Prophecy</hi> was the first of Blake's "Continental Prophecies," followed by <hi rend="i">Europe a Prophecy</hi> in 1794, executed in the same style and size but usually colored, and, in 1795, "Africa" and "Asia," two sections making up <hi rend="i">The Song of Los</hi>. Fine and important examples of all three works are in the Archive. Like all the illuminated books in the Archive, the text and images of <hi rend="i">America</hi> Copies B and I are fully searchable and are supported by the Archive's Compare feature. New protocols for transcription, which produce improved accuracy and fuller documentation in editors' notes, have been applied to Copies B and I and to all the <hi rend="i">America</hi> texts previously published.<lb/><lb/>                                                
                                                With the publication of these two copies, the Archive now contains fully searchable and scalable electronic editions of 85 copies of Blake's nineteen illuminated books in the context of full bibliographic information about each work, careful diplomatic transcriptions of all texts, detailed descriptions of all images, and extensive bibliographies. In addition to illuminated books, the Archive contains many important manuscripts and series of engravings, color printed drawings, tempera paintings, and water color drawings.<lb/><lb/>
                                                Due to recent security concerns related to Java browser plugins, the Archive has disabled its Java-based ImageSizer and Virtual Lightbox applications. Users can still view 100 and 300 dpi JPEG images as well as complete transcriptions for all works in the Archive including <hi rend="i">America</hi> Copies B and I. Text searching is also still available for all works in the Archive, and image searching remains available for all works except those in preview mode. In the coming months the Archive will implement redesigned pages that restore the features of ImageSizer and the Virtual Lightbox without the use of Java.<lb/><lb/>
                                                As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with the University of Rochester, the continuing support of the Library of Congress, and the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.

In the middle distance is a stone wall with, on the right, the

fragments of a top carved with classical motifs.  A great gap

appears to the left, and in this gap sits a giant winged figure. 

He is nude and muscular, with prominent knees and feet and both

arms shackled and chained to the ground or to the remnants of the wall on which he

squats or sits.  His legs are drawn up in an extremely contracted

posture, with his knees to his shoulders.  His head is lowered and

rests on his knees; his face is not pictured.  His hair is long and

curly.  The contracted posture and lowered head suggest despair. 

He may be Albion's Angel, the representative of the establishment

forces, or Orc, the personification of revolution.  To the right

is a family group, all nude.  A woman, very probably a mother,

sits on a fragment of the stone wall, legs crossed.  Her hair is long and her

face expresses a brooding fear, despair, or simply exhaustion. 

She holds in her lap a young child, probably male.  He

faces forward but perhaps looks up toward the woman.  His

(right?) knee is prominent.  Another child, of uncertain gender,

leans against the woman's left thigh and hip and hides his or her

head below the woman's left arm.  This figure's legs are crossed

at the ankles.  We see this figure from behind.  On the ground

below the woman is the haft of a broken sword, and further to the

left is a dismounted cannon.  The sky is dominated by dark

clouds, perhaps of smoke.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>Orc</characteristic><characteristic>Albion's Angel</characteristic><characteristic>angel</characteristic><characteristic>giant</characteristic><characteristic>arms at side</characteristic><characteristic>hands on ground</characteristic><characteristic>sitting</characteristic><characteristic>squatting</characteristic><characteristic>contracted</characteristic><characteristic>shackled</characteristic><characteristic>chained</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>head down</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>feet</characteristic><characteristic>knees</characteristic><characteristic>wing</characteristic><characteristic>head on knees</characteristic><characteristic>legs drawn up</characteristic><characteristic>muscular</characteristic><characteristic>despair</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A giant winged male sits or squats in a gap in a

corpses stacked like cord wood.  We see, on the first level of

the stack, the tops of the heads and horizontally-extended arms

of two rigid bodies lying prone.  The next layer is a single

rigid body, lying supine, with his legs extended to the right and

his arms at his side.  He faces up.  Above him is a gowned woman

with long hair, lying on top of him with her left leg drawn up

and her right leg extended.  She embraces the man around the neck

with her left arm.  Her face, seen in profile, touches the dead

or dying man's face below her; she may be kissing him, trying to

resuscitate him, or simply mourning over him.  Her mouth is partly open.  The dark sky above

these figures contains a few diagonal white lines that may

indicate rain or sleet descending from the clouds above.  These

large clouds bear the title, as though inscribed upon them, and

six figures.  On the left, a gowned woman with long hair sits

with right leg extended before her and her left leg bent back

behind her.  She faces and hunches over to the left, apparently

holding a book or tablet also being looked at or read by a gowned

child, probably male, with curly hair.  He stands before the

woman and faces right, but is probably looking down at the book

or tablet.  At least his right arm is extended horizontally and

may rest on the book or tablet.  Behind the woman is another

figure, perhaps nude and female, sitting with legs extended and

her back leaning against the back of the woman.  Although the

scale of the figures is uncertain, this may be a child or young

girl.  Another group of three figures is on the right.  An old,

bearded man with long hair sits facing to the right.  He wears a

heavy gown and hunches over a book or tablet on his lap, at which

he appears to be looking and perhaps reading.  His posture is

contracted, in contrast to the figure to the right—a nude female

hovering in the air.  We see her from behind; her posture is

gracefully twisted.  Her left arm is raised horizontally, her

right arm at 135 degrees.  The index finger on her right hand

points upward.  Her right leg is extended, her left drawn up.  Her hair is

in a bun.  Behind the old man is a nude male, youthful and facing

to the right although his body is turned to the left and leans

against the back of the old man.  His legs are crossed and he

points upward and to the left with his right arm, hand, and

extended index finger at an angle of 135 degrees.  His left arm

is bent and supported against the old man's back.  Although these

two nude figures are much smaller than the old man, they are

probably not children but energetic representations of spiritual

states unperceived, or ignored, by the old man.  The two large

figures with books or tablets have sometimes been identified as a

sibyl and a prophet.  Alternatively, the male may be a

priest.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="CD"><characteristic>group of figures</characteristic><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>corpse</characteristic><characteristic>dead</characteristic><characteristic>rigid</characteristic><characteristic>lying</characteristic><characteristic>prone</characteristic><characteristic>facing down</characteristic><characteristic>arms raised horizontally</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The lowest part of the design is formed of male

appears as though the plate is treated as a single design

extending across the top one third, down the left margin, and

across the lower margin.  A large tree, perhaps an oak, with

arching branches dominates the top left of the design.  The

vegetation right and left of the large trunk may be separate

bushes.  Below and to the right of its trunk is a large stone or

earthen bank (with a few tufts of grass) to which is shackled a

nude, youthful male by both hands and feet.  His arms are spread

out horizontally on the rock, as if crucified; his legs are also

spread apart.  His torso and neck are twisted, perhaps in pain;

he faces up.  His mouth is open; he may be speaking or crying in

pain.  His hair is curly; he is probably Orc, the spirit of

revolution here restrained.  To the right are a nude male and

female, both standing.  The female, with legs spread apart,

grasps her head with both hands, as if in mourning or despair. 

We do not see her face, but her upper torso is twisted to the

left—toward the shackled youth.  She may be Enitharmon, Orc's

mother.  Further to the right, the male stands with legs spread

apart.  His body faces us, but he turns his head to the left and

may be looking at the shackled youth.  His arms, with elbows

bent, are raised over his head, with his hands raised, palms out,

and the fingers of both hands spread apart.  His hair is spiky or

flame-like; his general expression is one of horror or grief. 

His mouth is slightly open; he may be speaking or crying out in

sorrow.  This may be Los, Orc's father.  Alternatively, the

couple has been identified as Adam and Eve, or as the "Dark

virgin" and Urthona (another name for Los) mentioned on this

plate (lines 12, 2).  The roots of the tree descend through the left

margin, perhaps taking on anthropomorphic shapes.  At the end of

the roots, in the far lower left corner of the plate, sits or

squats a nude, youthful male in a severely contracted posture. 

His legs are drawn up, with his head resting on his knees.  He

faces forward, with a grim expression, and holds his crossed

hands over his ankles.  His hair is curly or flame-like.  This

may be another representation of Orc, as the personification of

underground forces of revolution now enclosed but with the

potential to break out.  A reticulated worm, with six loops,

fills the lower margin.  The loops suggest (although they do not

quite form) a spiral.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="A"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>young</characteristic><characteristic>Orc</characteristic><characteristic>crucified</characteristic><characteristic>twisted</characteristic><characteristic>pain</characteristic><characteristic>shackled</characteristic><characteristic>chained</characteristic><characteristic>bound</characteristic><characteristic>arms raised horizontally</characteristic><characteristic>fingers spread</characteristic><characteristic>legs spread</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>facing up</characteristic><characteristic>mouth open</characteristic><characteristic>speaking</characteristic><characteristic>crying</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A nude, youthful male is shackled and chained to a stone or

would appear that the pictorial image is treated as a full-plate

design.  At top right, just below line 1, is a

winged dragon of a type traditionally called a wyvern.  The

creature is apparently flying through the air.  It faces to the

left, with a coiled or spiral tail with one loop on the right. 

Its skin looks scaly and its face is somewhat dog-like, with a

partly opened mouth and large teeth.  The top of its head bears a

crest.  Its front paws look almost like human hands.  Below and

to the left of its left paw is a jagged line, perhaps

representing a bolt of lightning.  Further to the left, and

descending into the left margin, is an old man.  His gown forms a

long, snake-like tail behind him, rather like the wyvern's tail. 

He has a long beard and long hair.  His right arm is at his side,

but we can see that, with his right hand, he grasps a large book

or tablet.  His left arm reaches downward and he holds in his

left hand a scepter or spear with a fleur-de-lis point.  This

figure may be Albion's Angel or Urizen (twice referred to in the

text) with his book of laws.  Below this descending figure is

another jagged line, perhaps representing lightning, and several

cloud outlines extending to the right margin above the last two lines

of text.  Below these billowing clouds, in the plate's lower

margin, is a landscape that includes three figures, probably a

family group of father, mother, and child.  Lower left is the

trunk of a large tree, fallen on the ground to the left.  On the

right, behind the figure group, is another fallen tree with a branch extending upward to the right margin.  The

male is the left-most figure in the group, lower right.  He is

nude and squats or kneels on the ground, with his upper body bent

forward.  Both arms are raised and bent at the elbows; he grasps

his head with both hands.  This gesture, and his crude facial

features, express despair or terror.  To the right is a crouching

female.  She may be gowned or nude.  Her left knee and foot are

prominent.  She turns her head to the right; we cannot see her

face because it is covered by the head of a child of uncertain

gender she embraces.  This child is standing and may be gowned,

although we can see little of this figure beyond the left side of

his or her head and the left leg.  These two figures seem to be

seeking protection in each other's arms.</illusobjdesc><component type="animal" location="AB"><characteristic>dragon</characteristic><characteristic>flying</characteristic><characteristic>wing</characteristic><characteristic>wyvern</characteristic><characteristic>coiled</characteristic><characteristic>spiral</characteristic><characteristic>tail</characteristic><characteristic>snake-like</characteristic><characteristic>loop</characteristic><characteristic>scales</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>mouth open</characteristic><characteristic>dog</characteristic><characteristic>crest</characteristic><characteristic>spiky</characteristic><characteristic>teeth</characteristic><characteristic>paw</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Just below line 1 is a winged dragon

treated as a full-plate design with six nude and muscular male

figures.  Top left is a man hovering horizontally in the air in

front of a cloud.  His left leg extends back and up behind him;

his left arm extends out to the right and he points in that

direction with his left index finger.  In his right hand he holds

large scales (or, more precisely, a pair of balances), perhaps to

be associated with the Day of Judgment.  This figure may be a

personification of Justice.  He has long hair and looks up and to

the right at the pair of figures to his right.  The lower man in

this pair seems to be standing, with one leg bent and one

extended, on the outline of the cloud.  He is bent over, with his

face hidden.  His hair is curly.  With both arms bent at the

elbows and extended over his head he carries on his back another

nude male.  This figure, in an extremely contracted posture, has

his arms clasped behind his back, both legs drawn up, and his

head and upper body bent over so that his head seems to touch his

groin or left thigh.  Perhaps we are to think that the man

holding this figure is about to cast him into the abyss.  Further

to the right, but still above the text area, is another nude

figure with long hair that forms loops.  In spite of this

feature, the musculature suggests a male.  We see him from

behind, floating vertically in the air, with legs slightly

spread.  His left arm is raised, his right is lowered, but he

grasps with both hands a giant sword with flames emanating from

its edge and trailing off to the right, as though blown by a

wind.  The arm position suggests that he may be sheathing the

sword, although no sheath is clearly pictured.  This figure,

perhaps another personification of Justice, looks to the right. 

Below the text are large tongues of flame, perhaps suggesting

hell.  Just above these fires are two more nude males.  The

figure on the left hovers horizontally in the air, although he

may be falling into the flames below.  His hair is curly.  His

pictorial image is treated as a full page design.  Given the

presence of stars and a crescent moon, this is a night scene. 

The sky is filled with clouds and the text panel is also shaped

like a cloud.  High in the sky, but below lines 1-4, a giant swan flies on extended wings to the right.  A

youthful nude male rides on his back.  The figure's legs are

spread apart and dangle on each side of the swan's back just in

front of its wings.  The youth's hair, blown to the left by the onward flight of the bird, may be curly.  He looks

back to the left, away from the direction of flight, and braces

himself with his right arm.  His left arm is raised horizontally

and he holds in his left hand a rein attached to the swan's beak. 

This figure has sometimes been identified as Boston's Angel,

although the reason for this may be nothing more than the fact

that he is named in the text immediately above the figure.  To

the right of the swan are four much smaller birds, all flying on

extended wings.  The largest of these has a forked tail.  Below,
and to the left of the text panel, are seven stars; these may be
a constellation, the Pleiades.  An eighth star is further below this group, left of lines 16-17.  Below the text, but still in the

night sky, are two more flying birds and, on the right, the

crescent moon and a single star (or perhaps the planet Venus). 

The earth appears only along the lower margin; on the far right

are a few spiky lines indicating vegetation.  Three nude children ride

on the back of a snake.  The front-most child, perhaps a girl

with long hair, holds a pair of reins in her left hand that

extends to the snake's open mouth.  Its forked tongue is

prominent.  The second child, further to the left, appears to be

a male.  He braces himself with his left arm, perhaps holding on

to the snake with his left hand, and reaches back with his right

arm to hold hands with the very young child or infant nearest the

snake's tail.  This child reaches up, perhaps with both hands,

but faces to the right and may be looking down.  The right-most

child has her legs together; the others have their legs spread on

each side of the snake (although we see only their right legs). 

The snake's body forms a loop left of the children and terminates

in two more loops and what appears to be three tails (two were eliminated in the

second state of the plate).</illusobjdesc><component type="object" location="E"><characteristic>sky</characteristic><characteristic>cloud</characteristic><characteristic>night</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Most of the design consists of the sky filled with

the tomb and then grows above it, where we see more of the trunk,

one large, leafless branch that arches over the text, and the

pictorial image is treated as a full-page design showing the

surface and bottom of the sea.  Above the text, the limp body of

a nude female lies supine on a stony shore, with her legs on the

right extending into the waves of the sea.  Her head is bent back

and her long hair descends below, as does her dangling right arm. 

She is probably dead, perhaps from drowning.  A plant with spiky leaves and a vine grow left of the woman's head.  A large bird, very

probably an eagle, is perched on her right upper leg.  The

eagle's wings are extended and his curved beak seems to be thrust

into the woman's abdomen.  The bird may be eating the corpse;

indeed, a triangular form below his beak may be a piece of her

flesh.  The sky behind the bird is filled with clouds; the sea on

the right (perhaps the Atlantic, named several times in the text)

is stormy.  Below the text we see the dark waters of the deep and

the bottom of the sea.  Upon it lies supine a nude male, with his

knees bent slightly and his left arm at his side.  His body is

emaciated and rigid; he is no doubt dead, probably from drowning. 

We can see his ribs and his fingers look skeletal, perhaps

because the sea creatures around him have been eating his flesh. 

These include one large fish and two small ones, all with their

mouths open.  A sea snake coils itself around the man's legs;

another snake hovers above his chest.  Five much smaller fish

appear immediately below the text and in the right margin

following lines 17-18.  Below the man, on the

floor of the sea, are two further sea snakes or worms.  Near the lower right corner is a large,

spiral shell, probably a whelk (common to the Atlantic).  In the

far lower right corner is a minimally-representational form that

may be another shell.  Vegetation rises in the left margin of the

text almost touching the female figure on the rocky shore.  This

vegetation may be seaweed.  The twisted lines include, left of

lines 5-8 of the text, a snake with

open mouth.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="AB"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>dead</characteristic><characteristic>corpse</characteristic><characteristic>limp</characteristic><characteristic>lying</characteristic><characteristic>supine</characteristic><characteristic>facing up</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>head bent back</characteristic><characteristic>drowned</characteristic><characteristic>flesh</characteristic><characteristic>arm down</characteristic><characteristic>arm dangling</characteristic><characteristic>legs extended</characteristic><characteristic>breasts</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The limp body of a nude female lies supine on a

spread appears to be hovering in the flames or rising through

shoulders.  She is facing up and to the left.  In the middle of

the design is a group of three embracing females.  The largest

sits or squats, facing right but with her head lowered.  She has

long hair.  We cannot see her face or arm positions.  In her lap

lies another nude female embracing the seated figure around her

waist with her left arm, raised horizontally.  Her body is

twisted and her face is also hidden.  The right-most figure in

the group is facing forward but her head is twisted toward the

seated figure.  This final female also has long hair; she may be

sitting or standing with her legs bent slightly.  Her left arm is extended horizontally.  To the right

of this group is another nude female in an extremely contracted

posture, facing left.  Her legs are drawn up with her knees to

her chest.  Her upper body leans forward over her raised knees

and her left arm partly encircles her lowered head and long hair.

females is a large grape leaf, a spiraling grape vine, and a

right margin, a great many interlinear motifs.  Most of these

take the form of vines or other vegetation; only the most

significant of these will be recorded here.  Above the second

word ("Albions") in line l, a bird flies upward on extended

wings.  The first letter of the first word in line 2 grows into a

vine, perhaps with leaves.  Line 3 is preceded by a

horse running or leaping to the left.  Following "Bristols" (line 3) are

the following, reading left to right: a vine with a standing

figure facing left, perhaps looking at a very small figure

looking right with arms raised horizontally; a vine with a seated

figure facing right; a flock of birds; a vine with perhaps a dog

standing on it, facing left (and barking at the birds?); a vine

with a standing figure facing left with at least one arm raised

horizontally; a small bird and a large bird (an eagle?) flying

upward; a tree trunk with one bare branch; a figure striding to

the left, at least one arm raised vertically, holding something

(perhaps a child?) in his or her raised hand.  Two birds fly on extended wings above "And cast" in line 7.  Following the word

"mail" (line 6) is another series of very small motifs.  These are,

from left to right: a leafless tree; a minimally representational

form that may be a figure sitting on the ground with one arm

propping up the upper body; two figures facing each other,

perhaps coming together to embrace or to fight; a vine with one

leaf; a vine with two loops and one leaf; a vine-like form with a

figure above it, striding and facing to the left with at least

one arm raised horizontally; a vine bearing, and arching over, a

figure lying on it and facing left.  Following line 8 is a vine,

growing from the second letter of "chattering" in line 9,

and a hovering figure, with legs spread, facing to the left and

holding to his or her mouth (and thus playing?) a trumpet or horn

of some sort.  A vine with two loops extends to the left from the

first letter of "hills" (line 12).  At the end of this line, a

twisting vine appears above the final word ("sky").  A tassel of

grain grows from the final letter of "sky."  Between lines 12 and

13 are several motifs.  From left to right these are a vine with

two loops growing from the first letter of "The" at the beginning

of line 13; a very small figure striding to the right, with at

least one arm raised horizontally, on top of the first letter of

the first word in line 13; two vines, one with two loops; a small

bird flying; a seated human figure with knees bent, at least one

arm raised horizontally, and facing to the left; a vine with

leaves growing from the "d" of "winds" in line 13; a vine or

grain tassel growing from the first letter of "driven" in line

13; and a bird flying on extended wings above "flames" in line

13.  A vine, with flowers or leaves, descends from the last

letter of "scales" (line 21).  Birds fly on extended

wing above "spirits" and "dead pining" (line 25). 

Above "bonds of" in the same line, a stag runs or leaps to the

                  left.  A bird—or perhaps a moth—flies at the end of the

line.  A vine-like form with one loop connects the last letters of lines 24 and 28.</illusobjdesc><component type="animal" location="A"><characteristic>bird</characteristic><characteristic>flying</characteristic><characteristic>rising</characteristic><characteristic>wing</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Above the second word ("Albions") in line l, a bird

crouches on the ground in an extremely contracted posture.  Her

legs are bent under her body and her upper body is bent forward

at a sharp angle over her legs.  She faces right but her head faces down; her face is

covered by her right arm, bent at the elbow with the upper arm

raised.  Apparently, her hands are together in an attitude of

prayer or supplication.  Her long hair cascades below her right

elbow and down the right margin of the text, perhaps transformed

into a waterfall.  Despair and crying are suggested by the

figure; perhaps we are to think of the waterfall as her tears. 

The figure has been variously identified as a personification of

Earth (given the presence of other figures on her body) and even

as Urizen, in spite of the apparent gender.  Seven figures stand

or sit on the giant's body.  On her head is a seated figure,

facing right and holding (and apparently reading) a book or

tablet.  On her back are two figures, one standing and facing

right.  This apparently gowned figure holds a book or tablet in

her or his right hand.  Just to the right is a kneeling figure,

with one leg extended back, and the right arm raised at 135

degrees.  This figure may be looking up and supplicating or

praying.  Below these two figures, and standing on the giant

figure's right upper thigh, is a tree with three branches (but no

leaves).  Standing and leaning against this tree is a (probably

male) figure facing to the right.  He wears a broad-brimmed hat

and holds and plays a pipe.  Further down the giant's thigh are a

few forms that may be sheep lying (and sleeping?) on her body. 

Thus, the piper is probably a shepherd.  Below the piper, a very

small figure lies on the giant's calf, facing right.  This too

may be a shepherd, given the presence of a few forms to the right

that may be lying (and sleeping?) sheep.  Just to the left of the

giant's right foot is an embracing couple.  The figure most

likely to be the female in this group is seated with at least one

leg bent at the knee, head facing down, and left arm raised

horizontally to embrace her companion.  The man kneels on the

ground, facing right, with his right arm extended at 45 degrees

to touch the woman's left thigh.  To the right of this couple,

and standing on the ground just beneath the giant's lower leg, a

stag runs or leaps to the right.  The left portion of this design

above the text is a forest of at least four leafless trees. 

Their trunks have anthropomorphic forms.  We can also see some of

their roots near the left margin; one such root extends left of the

first nine lines of text in the left margin.  The ground near the right margin apparently descends over a cliff.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="AB"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>giant</characteristic><characteristic>crouching</characteristic><characteristic>legs drawn up</characteristic><characteristic>contracted</characteristic><characteristic>hunched over</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>facing down</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>hands together</characteristic><characteristic>praying</characteristic><characteristic>supplicating</characteristic><characteristic>despair</characteristic><characteristic>crying</characteristic><characteristic>Earth</characteristic><characteristic>Urizen</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A giant figure, wearing a gown and probably female,
