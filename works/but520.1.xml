      <seriesstmt>The William Blake Archive</seriesstmt>
      <updatestmt>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of thirty-three of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible.  All take their subjects from the New Testament and have been added to the twenty Old Testament subjects published in March 2010 as “Illustrations to the Bible, c. 1780-1824,” under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.  This new group is presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).
                
        <lb/>
        <lb/>
        Blake executed most of these New Testament water colors c. 1800-05 for his patron Thomas Butts.  The exceptions are 
        <hi rend="i">The Whore of Babylon</hi>
        of 1809 and 
        <hi rend="i">The Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins</hi>
        in the Yale Center for British Art, datable to c. 1825. The subjects range from the childhood of Jesus to his ascension, the later history of his parents and one of his major followers, St. Paul, and a group of eight designs based on the Book of Revelation.  While the illustrations of the life of Christ are fairly conventional in their subjects, in part because of the long tradition of picturing almost every event in the Gospels, individual motifs recall designs in Blake’s illuminated books and thus offer a window on Blake’s visual interpretation of the Bible. The illustrations of Revelation complement Blake’s intense engagement with apocalyptic events and images in his own poetry.
                    
        <lb/>
        <lb/>
        The selection of fifty-three biblical water colors now available in the Archive will be supplemented in the future with early works, such as 
        <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>
        , datable to c. 1780, and will continue through Blake’s final biblical water colors, such as 
        <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi>
        . 
                    
        <lb/>

        <illustration location="E" type="plate">
          <illusobjdesc>The design takes its subject from Revelation 12:12-17. At the top center is the figure of a dragon or devil facing forward and down. This figure may be male and nude. He has bat-like wings and a serpentine tail that loops three times to form a spiral. This figure has seven heads, the three leftmost looking left and down and the three rightmost looking right and down. The heads on each side of the central head, and closest to it, have short, curly hair and horns with one loop in each. The middle head wears a crown and has ram-like horns with one loop in each. His spine bone is visible. His arms are raised horizontally, palms down and his right leg is bent slightly. He may be looking at the woman beneath him. Dominating the bottom center of the design is a winged female angel wearing a gown—or, in the context of the title, the woman clothed with the sun. She sits or kneels with her legs bent and her right leg partly drawn up. Her arms are raised horizontally with her palms held vertically. She faces forward and slightly right and looks up and to the left. Her long, curly hair is flame-like and stands on end. The woman at the bottom center of the design kneels on an outjutting of rock, perhaps meant to represent a mountaintop or cliff. The sky in the background is dark, perhaps indicating that the scene takes place at night. Clouds are visible in the sky, as are bolts of lightning. In the background to the left of the woman may be at least five figures, facing left and away. They are mostly just visible as sketchy heads, but the leftmost figure may be gowned with short hair, facing down or bending forward. In the background to the right of the woman may be at least six figures, facing down and to the right. The leftmost figure may be that of a nude male with short, curly hair, facing away and bending forward. The second-to-left figure may be that of a gowned male with short hair, facing forward and looking up, mouth open. The third-to-left figure may be that of a nude male with long hair and a beard, facing away. His right arm is raised at 135 degrees and his body is nearly horizontal, suggesting that he may be flying, hovering, or falling. The fourth-to-right figure may be that of a gowned woman with long hair pulled up into a bun, facing away. Her body is nearly horizontal and her right arm is bent upward, perhaps with her hand to her face. The heads of two further figures appear above the arm of the figure third from the left.

He has bat-like wings and a serpentine tail that loops three times to form a spiral. This figure has seven heads, the three leftmost looking left and down and the three rightmost looking right and down. The heads on each side of, and closest to, the central head have short, curly hair and horns with one loop in each. The middle head wears a spiky crown and has ram-like horns with one loop in each. His spine bone is visible. His arms are raised horizontally, palms down and his right leg is bent slightly. He may be looking at the woman beneath him. </illusobjdesc>
