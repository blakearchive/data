Lamech, a descendent of Cain and the central figure in the design, has in a rage killed the young man lower right.  Lamech clutches his head in despair and in the knowledge that the penalty of Cain will fall on him "seventy and sevenfold" (Genesis 4:24).  Lamech's two wives, Adah and Zillah, cling together on the left.  Blake may have known the more detailed telling of the story in the Apocrypha, as well as the traditional association between Lamech's son, Tubalcain, and metal working.</p><p>The title, "Lamech and his two Wives," is inscribed in pencil below the design, almost certainly not by Blake.</p></objnote><objsize>43.1 x 60.8 cm.</objsize><windowsize width="600" height="550"/></physdesc><illusdesc><illustration type="plate" location="E"><illusobjdesc>The central figure, Lamech, holds his head in distress as he stares at the dead body lying on the ground to the right.  His two wives, Adah and Zillah, stand to the left of Lamech, embracing each other as they look toward their husband.  A flowing piece of drapery, perhaps part of a tent, descends along the left margin of the design.  The background is mountainous and dark, with a dark cloud upper right.

His left foot is prominent at the hem of his flowing gown.

Her left arm must be similarly wrapped around the other side of the woman’s torso, for her left hand rests along the other woman's side just below the right hand.  It seems that her left hand is clutching the gown.  She faces forward but twists to the right; one knee (the right?) is prominent.  Her mouth is slightly opened and she stares at the scene unfolding before her with eyes raised and a facial expression of fear.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="AC"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>Adah</characteristic><characteristic>Zillah</characteristic><characteristic>young</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>drapery</characteristic><characteristic>hem</characteristic><characteristic>seen from behind</characteristic><characteristic>facing away</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>twisted</characteristic><characteristic>embracing</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>partly nude</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>striding</characteristic><characteristic>right foot</characteristic><characteristic>tiptoe</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Adah and Zillah, Lamech's two wives, embrace each other as they stand to the left of Lamech.
