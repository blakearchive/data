                          The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of electronic editions of Copies D and G of <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi>. Copy D is in the British Museum and Copy G is in the Fitzwilliam Museum.
                <lb/><lb/><hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> is dated 1789 by Blake on the title page, but the first plate (Thel's Motto) and the last (her descent into the netherworld) appear to have been completed and first printed in 1790, while Blake was working on <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>. Copies D and G are from the first of three printings of <hi rend="i">Thel</hi>, during which Blake produced at least thirteen copies, printed in five different inks to diversify his stock. Copy D, for example, was printed in yellow ochre ink, Copy G in green and greenish-blue inks; both are lightly finished in water colors. Copies from this press run were certainly on hand when Blake included the book in his advertisement "To the Public" of October 1793: "The Book of Thel, a Poem in Illuminated Printing. Quarto, with 6 designs, price 3s." Copies D and G join copies in the Archive from the other two printings: Copy F, printed and colored c. 1795, and Copy O, printed and colored c. 1818. They also join Copies H, J, L, and R from the first printing.
                    <lb/><lb/>
                        Like all the illuminated books in the Archive, the text and images of <hi rend="i">Thel</hi> Copies D and G are fully searchable and are supported by our Inote and ImageSizer applications. With the Archive's Compare feature, users can easily juxtapose multiple impressions of any plate across the different copies of this or any of the other illuminated books. New protocols for transcription, which produce improved accuracy and fuller documentation in editors' notes, have been applied to Copies D and G and to all the <hi rend="i">Thel</hi> texts previously published.
                    <lb/><lb/>
                        With the publication of <hi rend="i">Thel</hi> Copies D and G, the Archive now contains fully searchable and scalable electronic editions of 79 copies of Blake's nineteen illuminated books in the context of full bibliographic information about each work, careful diplomatic transcriptions of all texts, detailed descriptions of all images, and extensive bibliographies. In addition to illuminated books, the Archive contains many important manuscripts and series of engravings, sketches, color print drawings, tempera paintings, and water color drawings.
                        <lb/><lb/>

protectively over the title words and major pictorial motifs. 
This combination of motifs and their position suggests a 
tombstone.  Two birds and a human figure soar in the sky; 
seven other human forms, one winged, rest or climb among the 
title letters.  Thel, wearing a long gown and holding a 
shepherd's crook, stands lower left and gazes at a nude man 
embracing a woman around the waist.  The latter wears a gown, 
or at least a skirt, and raises her arms.  These small figures 
seem to emerge from the large, bowl-like flowers lower center 
and right.  The leaves of this plant and a flower bud complete 
the design lower center and right. The design does not directly  
illustrate a scene in the text, but the figures embracing above 
the flowers may suggest the "raptures" (Plate 5, line 13) of the Cloud
and the "fair eyed dew" (Plate 5, line 15) during their courtship.</illusobjdesc><component type="vegetation" location="E"><characteristic>tree</characteristic><characteristic>willow</characteristic><characteristic>birch</characteristic><characteristic>tombstone</characteristic><characteristic>arching</characteristic><characteristic>branch</characteristic><characteristic>leaf</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A large tree, perhaps a willow or birch,
