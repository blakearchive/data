                The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of electronic editions of Blake's illustrations to works by William Hayley, including his <hi rend="i">Essay on Sculpture</hi>, the broadside ballad <hi rend="i">Little Tom the Sailor</hi>, <hi rend="i">The Triumphs of Temper</hi>, <hi rend="i">The Life and Posthumous Writings of William Cowper</hi>, and <hi rend="i">The Life of George Romney</hi>. We are also republishing Blake’s etched and engraved illustrations to <hi rend="i">Designs to a Series of Ballads, Written by William Hayley</hi> (1802) and Hayley’s <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi> (1805). The designs and engraved texts of both sets of <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi>&#160;illustrations, as well as the new material now being published, are fully searchable.<lb/><lb/>
                In late 1799, William Hayley was seeking an engraver to illustrate his poem <hi rend="i">Essay on Sculpture</hi>. Possibly on the advice of the sculptor John Flaxman, Hayley commissioned Blake to produce three plates. In July 1800, Blake spent much of July working on the final plate, an engraving of Hayley’s deceased son, Thomas, in Hayley’s library in the coastal village of Felpham, West Sussex. During these weeks, Hayley persuaded Blake to relocate from London to Felpham to work on a number of graphic projects.  Disenchanted with his failure to secure commercial engraving work in London, Blake enthusiastically took up Hayley’s offer.<lb/><lb/>                                                
                The works now published and republished include all of Blake’s commercial engravings executed for Hayley during the three-year period Blake and his wife Catherine spent in Felpham. In addition, the Blake Archive is publishing two more engravings Blake worked on for Hayley after the Blakes had returned to London in September 1803. These plates were commissioned to illustrate Hayley’s <hi rend="i">The Life of George Romney</hi> (1809). Only one of these plates, <hi rend="i">Sketch of a Shipwreck after Romney</hi>, was included in the published biography. The other, a portrait engraving of Romney, was rejected and, until very recently, has not been seen since the 1939 Blake exhibition in Philadelphia. <lb/><lb/>

Beneath the tailpiece is a colophon. The headpiece depicts an ocean scene during a storm. In the upper center of the design is a nude male, identified as the spirit of Little Tom's father in Hayley's poem, facing forward and floating or hovering between storm clouds. He may be wearing a belt or rope around his waist. Only his upper body is visible. Both arms are raised horizontally in a cruciform pose, with palms facing outward parting the clouds. The figure has long flame-like hair; his head faces forward, to the right and slightly downward. His mouth may be slightly open and he may be speaking. The figure below is a clothed child with long, curly hair, identified as Little Tom in Hayley's poem. Facing forward, with his head titled slightly to the left and upward, Little Tom is looking at the figure above and is standing on the curved rim of a boat. His legs are apart, with the right leg bent at 90 degrees and the left slightly bent. Both feet are visible. His left arm is at his side while his right arm is bent upward above his head. With his left hand, Little Tom grasps a rope and with his right hand holds a vertical mast. Little Tom is wearing breeches and a coat, which is open to the waist. Beneath the coat is a shirt with a collar.  
  Much of the boat that Little Tom is standing on is submerged by a white-crested wave. Its vertical mast extends diagonally to the left. At the tip of the mast is a flag. A boom extends diagonally to the left. Alternatively, this could be a bowsprit, the spar that extends from a boat's prow. A sail is attached to the underside of the boom or bowsprit. A rope extends from a pulley on the upper side of the boom or bowsprit. An extension of this rope or another rope extends from Little Tom's left hand to the bottom right edge of the design. Also to the right of the mast, and extending downward from the left palm of Little Tom's father, is a bolt of lightening. The background is dark, suggesting a night scene. Vertical lines extending beneath the clouds may indicate rain.   
  The tailpiece design is a cottage door scene populated by four figures. The central figure is a tall female, facing the viewer. Her body faces slightly to the right while her head is turned to the left and downward slightly. According to Hayley's poem, this is Little Tom's mother, the Widow Spicer of Folkestone. She wears a long dress and bonnet. Below the hem of her dress, her feet are visible. Her right foot is on tip toe and she appears to be walking. Her right arm is by her side and in her right hand she holds a basket or container covered with cloth. Her left arm is bent at 90 degrees across her chest. She is pointing with her right hand to the figures on the left of the plate. She is also looking in that direction.  
  The figures that the Widow Spicer is pointing and looking at are located on the left of the plate and in a stone cottage. The figure standing in the doorway is a young male with long hair, wearing breeches and a coat with three buttons. Beneath the coat is a shirt with a collar. This is Little Tom. He faces toward the viewer with his head facing right in the direction of his mother. His eyes and mouth are open. He is both looking at his mother and may be speaking to her. His right arm is raised 90 degrees and the palm on his right hand faces outward. He is gesturing to the interior of the cottage and the two figures behind him. His left arm is by his side. The fingers on his left hand appear to be spread. Little Tom's legs are together, with his right leg extending behind his left leg. His right foot is on tip toe. Behind Little Tom are two figures. The leftmost figure is a (female?) child, identified in Hayley's poem as an "Ideot." The child is in profile, facing right with head slightly downward, has long hair and is wearing a gown. The child's right arm is by its side. There is an infant in a wicker crib, identified in Hayley's poem as a sick little infant. The crib has a hood, is on a rocker and has a handle. The gender of the infant is indeterminate and only the head, which rests on a pillow, is visible. The infant's face turns to the left and is wearing a tight-fitting hat or hood. The body is obscured by a blanket and by the lower body of Little Tom.
   On the left of the plate is a stone cottage with an open, wood-framed door. Above the crib is a wood-framed window. Next to, and slightly behind the right wall of the cottage is a large, heavily-leaved tree. The shape of the leaves suggest that this is might be an oak. The trunk divides into two main branches and some roots are visible. The foliage on the right branch extends over the Widow Spicer, along the top of the plate. 
      A path or road curves in the lower right portion of the tailpiece. Either side of the path is grass and/or indeterminate vegetation. There is also grass just above the lower edge of the design. The path winds through a densely wooded area in the middle distance with visible tree trunks. There is a hill in the middle distance, behind Widow Spicer and the oak tree. In the background, to the right of Widow Spicer's shoulder, are the spires and towers of a building or series of buildings. This is probably a city, identified in Hayley's poem as Folkestone. Behind the city is a peaked mountain. The sky is cloudy, possibly with a sunrise or sunset above the mountain peak.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="AB"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>father</characteristic><characteristic>spirit</characteristic><characteristic>ghost</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>head toward viewer</characteristic><characteristic>mouth open</characteristic><characteristic>speaking</characteristic><characteristic>flame-like hair</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>arms raised horizontally</characteristic><characteristic>palm out</characteristic><characteristic>palm vertical</characteristic><characteristic>dividing</characteristic><characteristic>belt</characteristic><characteristic>rope</characteristic><characteristic>pushing</characteristic><characteristic>floating</characteristic><characteristic>hovering</characteristic><illusobjdesc>In the upper center of the plate is a nude male, identified as the spirit of Little Tom's father in Hayley's poem, facing forward and hovering between storm clouds.
