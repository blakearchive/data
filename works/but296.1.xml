God extends his right arm, hand, and index finger to point in judgment at the nude and hunched or bowing form of Adam, who stands before him with eyes down and face partly obscured by his long, flowing beard.  God’s left hand rests on a book or tablet (of laws?) on his lap.  God may be holding the frontmost horse's rein in his right hand or possibly a rod or scepter pointing at Adam.  Beams of light radiate from the flaming disc or globe behind God.  Grass, moss, lichens, or some such vegetation may be growing beneath the feet of Adam and the horses.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>God</characteristic><characteristic>old</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>sitting</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>eyes down</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>arm extended</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised horizontally</characteristic><characteristic>pointing</characteristic><characteristic>hand</characteristic><characteristic>fingers</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent</characteristic><characteristic>arm resting</characteristic><characteristic>left foot</characteristic><characteristic>anger</characteristic><characteristic>hem</characteristic><illusobjdesc>God sits on a chariot of flame.  He is bearded, gowned, and old, and has long hair.  Flames surround him as he faces to the left with his head bent slightly forward and down to look at Adam.  His expression and posture may suggest anger.  His right arm, hand, and index finger are extended to point at Adam, who stands before him; God may also be using his right hand to hold the frontmost horse's rein or a rod or scepter.  His left arm is bent at the elbow, and his left hand rests on the book or tablet on his lap.  His bare left foot is visible beneath the hem of his gown, and appears to be resting on a platform of the chariot.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="object" location="CD"><characteristic>book</characteristic><characteristic>tablet</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A book or tablet (of laws?) rests on God’s lap.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="object" location="AB"><characteristic>rod</characteristic><characteristic>scepter</characteristic><characteristic>rein</characteristic><characteristic>line</characteristic><illusobjdesc>God may be holding a scepter or rod in his right hand, pointed toward Adam.

This posture suggests reverence and perhaps fear.  He has long hair, with a prominent forelock, and his beard obscures the lower part of his face.  He faces to the right with his left leg bent behind him, and his left foot poised on tiptoe.  He may be striding toward God.  His arms (or at least his right arm) are probably bent upward, for his right hand is raised to his forehead and his palms may be together in prayer or supplication.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="object" location="AB"><characteristic>light</characteristic><characteristic>radiance</characteristic><characteristic>beams of light</characteristic><characteristic>sky</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Beams of light or radiance extend from the disc or globe behind God’s chariot and fill the sky.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="vegetation" location="CD"><characteristic>grass</characteristic><characteristic>moss</characteristic><characteristic>lichens</characteristic><characteristic>indeterminate</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The hues and reticulations of the color printing suggest that grass, moss, lichens, or some such vegetation grows beneath the feet of Adam and the horses.</illusobjdesc></component></illustration></illusdesc></desc></objdesc></bad>
