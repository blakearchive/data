            The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of 20 of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible. These designs illustrate the Old Testament and are arranged according to the passages illustrated.  They are presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).
            <lb/><lb/>
            The Bible had an enormous influence on Blake’s work as both artist and poet.  Among his many and complex responses to that text are water color drawings.  The present group of 20 is selected from a sequence of about 80 biblical water colors of similar size Blake painted for Thomas Butts between c. 1800 and c. 1806.  These designs emphasize interactions between the human and the divine.  In works such as <hi rend="i">Ezekiel’s Wheels</hi> and <hi rend="i">David Delivered Out of Many Waters</hi>, the interaction is revelatory or redemptive.  In other designs, including <hi rend="i">Pestilence: The Death of the First-Born</hi>, the relationship between God and humankind devolves into punishment and destruction.
            <lb/><lb/>
            This group of 20 water colors is the first installment in our publication of a large selection of Blake’s water color drawings illustrating the Bible.  In coming months we will publish a group of New Testament illustrations also from the series executed for Butts.  Later we will add early works, such as <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>, datable to c. 1780, and continue through Blake’s final biblical water colors, including <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi> of c. 1824.
            <lb/><lb/>

Samson, an almost-nude male, dominates the center of the design. The bonds he breaks are ropes tied in knots on his wrists and ankles. He has short, curly hair and a beard. Samson faces forward and slightly right, though he bends his head back to look up at the female figure to his right. His arms are raised at 135 degrees, palms out and fingers spread; his left leg is bent at the knee and his right leg is extended backward and on tiptoe. His mouth may be slightly open. Samson sits on what appears to be a chair covered with cloth which also covers his genitals. To the right stands a female figure, presumably Delilah. She faces right and slightly forward, though turns her head to look to the left and down at Samson. She wears a gown and has a hat or braided headdress atop her curly hair. Her arms are bent, with the left arm bent upward, and fingers spread. Her left palm faces out, her right away from the viewer. She crouches on the seat on which Samson also sits, with her left leg bent and her right leg extended backward and on tiptoe. To the left of Samson are three male figures, probably guards or soldiers, seen from behind. They may wear armor and helmets and appear to be fleeing the scene. They all bend forward slightly, two with their left legs extended back and on tiptoe and their right legs bent to climb stairs. Their left arms are raised horizontally, fingers spread. The legs of the leftmost figure are not visible. The scene appears to take place in a room, possibly a prison cell, which has stairs in the left background and a curtain in the right background.
