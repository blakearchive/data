            <updatestmt>
                The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of seventeen pen and ink drawings by Blake. Ranging chronologically from his apprenticeship as an engraver to the final decade of his life, this group offers a comprehensive overview of his work in the medium. Most were created when Blake was learning his craft as an artist and reveal his exploration of various themes and genres. His apprentice drawings for James Basire (<hi rend="i">The Body of Edward I and Countess Aveline</hi>) show his early engagement with medieval art. Another group (two drawings titled <hi rend="i">Figures from a Greek Vase</hi> and <hi rend="i">Charon</hi>) is clearly based on classical art or mythology, responses to which were central to British art and design in the second half of the eighteenth century. The cluster of related sketches on two leaves, each titled <hi rend="i">Four Composition Sketches</hi>, is the earliest extant example of Blake’s attempt to construct a pictorial narrative through a series of images. In these, he began to develop his own version of the sublime, an aesthetic more fully represented by the texts and designs in the illuminated books of the 1790s. Several works from the 1780s show the influence of neoclassicism and take their subjects from two fields of lasting interest to Blake: British history (<hi rend="i">King Alfred</hi>, <hi rend="i">A Woman Enthroned</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Procession of Monks</hi>) and the Bible (<hi rend="i">Saul and David</hi>, <hi rend="i">Goliath Cursing David</hi>, and two versions of <hi rend="i">The Good Farmer</hi>). The three much later drawings are exceptions to Blake’s customary procedures and subjects: a landscape <hi rend="i">Garden Path</hi>, <hi rend="i">The Prophet Isaiah</hi> drawn on a woodblock for a wood engraving never executed, and <hi rend="i">Lady Torrens</hi>, a copy of a family portrait by his friend and patron John Linnell.<lb/>
                <lb/>
                Blake did not execute a large number of pen and ink drawings. This is a bit surprising, given the compatibility between the linearity of the medium and his insistence on “the distinct, sharp, and wirey ... bounding line” as the “great and golden rule of art” (Blake’s <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi>). He did, however, make extensive use of pen and ink work to outline forms in his water colors, color prints, and hand tinted relief etchings in the illuminated books. For preliminary sketching, Blake favored pencil over pen and ink, probably because of the lower cost of pencil and the ease of erasure and correction it offered. The Archive will publish his pencil sketches decade by decade, beginning with the earliest works, 1779 through 1790.<lb/>
                <lb/>
                This is the first time that works from the Society of Antiquaries, London have been represented in the Archive. Accordingly, we are also publishing the Society's Blake collection list, which includes all of its original works by Blake, not just those published in the Archive, and joins the Collection Lists of over thirty other contributing institutions.<lb/>
                <lb/>
                As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees.

The sketch in the upper right quadrant shows at least one figure seated facing right.  The sketch in the lower left quadrant contains two figures seated on a couch with an elaborate bolster-like arm.  Clouds or perhaps beams of light are visible above the pair at left.  The sketch in the lower right quadrant contains a single gowned figure facing right with one arm raised horizontally. There is a cluster of diagonal brushstrokes of grey wash to the left of this figure.  To the left of the line demarcating the lower left scene, a portion of a sketch continued from another leaf of sketches (Butlin 85 verso) is visible, indicating that the two pages were originally part of the same sheet of paper.</illusobjdesc>

Its right leg is extended backward, its right arm raised horizontally, and its left arm raised at 135 degrees.  The figure may twist its head to look back to the left, where lines that suggest flames extend from the left margin of the sketch from which the figure is fleeing.  The multiplicity of lines forming the figure may suggest movement or, alternatively, the presence of a second figure directly behind the first.  This second figure, partly erased, may be an alternative posture for the first figure.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>Four composition sketches are each separated by rough framing lines.   The sketch in the upper right quadrant shows at least one figure seated or kneeling on bent legs facing right with one arm raised at 45 degrees.  This figure appears to wear a gown with a belt.  There may be a second head and extended arm suggested behind and to the right of the first figure.  This second figure, perhaps partly erased, may be an alternative posture for the first figure.  Lines on the right side of the sketch suggest fire and smoke.  The figure may be warming its hands at the fire.</illusobjdesc>

The figure holds an indistinct object that may be a book or tablet(?), suggesting he or she may be reading.</illusobjdesc>
