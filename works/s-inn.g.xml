                The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of electronic editions of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> Copy G, from the Yale Center for British Art, and <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> Copy N, from the Huntington Library and Art Gallery.
                <lb/><lb/><hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> Copy G was printed with fifteen others in the book’s first printing in 1789. Four of these copies were later joined with <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> impressions, printed in 1794, to form <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> Copies B, C, E, which are in the Archive, and D. Copy G also joins <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> Copies B and U and will be joined in the coming years by eleven more separately printed copies of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> that are currently in production. Unlike many of these early copies of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi>, Copy G still consists of all 31 plates originally composed and executed for <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi>. The plates were printed in yellow ochre ink on 17 leaves and wiped of their plate borders; the designs were very lightly washed in watercolors and the texts left unwashed. These borderless designs, printed on both sides of the leaves to create facing pages, look more like illuminated manuscripts than prints or paintings. This mode of presentation exemplifies Blake's early printing and coloring style. Using the Archive’s Compare feature, which enables users to juxtapose impressions from the same illuminated plate printed in different periods, users of the Archive can contrast this early style to Blake’s late style, c. 1818-1827. For example, in <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> Copies V, Y, Z, and AA, which are in the Archive, Blake printed and finished the impressions to look like miniature paintings.
                <lb/><lb/>
                After 1794, the printing history of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> becomes complex because Blake began printing it with <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> to form copies of the combined <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> while continuing also to issue <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> and <hi rend="i">Songs of Experience</hi> separately. Complicating matters further are the facts that some separately issued copies of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> were combined with <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> by collectors and dealers, and that copies of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> now separate were once part of copies of the combined <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>. Copy N of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> contains 25 plates, all from <hi rend="i">Songs of Experience</hi>. These are numbered by Blake 30 to 54, thus indicating that the copy once included <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi>. This may have been what is now called Copy W of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi>, untraced since 1941. The <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> impressions of <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> Copy N were printed with plate borders in brownish-black ink on one side of the leaf and finished in water color washes and pen and ink outlining. This is an intermediate printing and coloring style, between the earliest styles as represented by <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> Copy G and the color printed works of 1794 and late style, c. 1818-1827.
                <lb/><lb/>
                Like all the illuminated books in the Archive, the texts and images of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> Copy G and <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> of <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> Copy N are fully searchable and are supported by our Virtual Lightbox and ImageSizer applications. In addition to the Archive's Compare feature, users can use the Lightbox to juxtapose and examine images from any of the works in the Archive side by side, as well as crop, zoom, and juxtapose them for close study.
                <lb/><lb/>
                New protocols for transcriptions, which produce improved accuracy and fuller documentation in editors' notes, have been applied to <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> Copy G and <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> of <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> Copy N and to all the <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> and <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> texts previously published. With the publication of these two copies, the Archive now contains fully searchable and scalable electronic editions of 83 copies of Blake's nineteen illuminated books in the context of full bibliographic information about each work, careful diplomatic transcriptions of all texts, detailed descriptions of all images, and extensive bibliographies. In addition to illuminated books, the Archive contains many important manuscripts and series of engravings, color printed drawings, tempera paintings, and water color drawings.

                  the text and between stanzas.  The initial "A" in the title sprouts
                  a plant-like structure on the left, while a loopy vine-like
                  extension dangles all the way down the left margin.  The vegetation
                  in the upper right margin—beside the "m" of "Dream" in the title—seems to be an arc of tasseled 
                  grass or grain that curves back over the title.  Beneath it—opposite stanzas 1 and 2—are 
                  three or four clusters of flame-like
                  leaves or tufts of grass.  Below those are a bit of leafy vine
                  (after line 10) and a branch or root of some sort (after line 13). 
                  In the lower right margin—opposite stanzas 4 
                  and 5—is an odd tree(?).  In front of the tree stands a figure,
                  robed, apparently wearing a hat, and holding a staff—probably the
                  "watchman of the night" (line 17), the glow-worm of the text in
                  human form.  He is one of four small human figures on the plate. 
                  The other three are in the area of the title: lying, presumably 
                  sleeping, on the left stroke of the initial "A"; sitting, perhaps
                  reading, in the "D" of "Dream"; and floating or flying, with arms
                  raised horizontally, between bits of vegetation beneath the "e" of
                  "Dream."  The animal life of the poem appears in similarly tiny
                  forms in the margins: there could be an ant (the "Emmet" of line 4)
                  crawling beneath the "her" in line 9, another ant
                  or beetle to the right of line 4, a worm or caterpillar nestled in the 
                  lower right sprigs of the vegetation right of line 6, and a winged beetle(?) (lines 19-20)
                  flying right of line 18.  A bird, perhaps an eagle,
                  unmentioned in the text, spreads its wings above "dream" in line

                  "Old John with white hair" (line 11, Object 10), points forward with

                  flame-like leaves, apparently rooted at right in the strip of
                  grassy ground that runs across the bottom of 
                  the plate, grows along the ground under the last stanza and then up
                  the left margin.  Between 
                  stanzas three and four the plant forks.  One part continues up the
                  left margin and ends under the

                  right margin, curves back over the title and ends in an upward
                  flourish at top left.  The large plant 
                  is encircled in its upper reaches by a leafy vine that is rooted,
                  like the plant itself, at the bottom 
                  right corner.  From there the vine climbs up the right margin right
                  of the standing figure and then, 
                  after arching over the figure's head, onto the flame-like plant,
                  which the vine continues to climb, finally terminating just left of

                  facing right, hands raised in prayer; (at bottom right) a gowned
                  figure stands, with an arm extended, perhaps touching the left hand

                  female angel who looks down at the infant and holds her hands out
                  toward it.  Each of her small wings is marked with a dot.  The

                     left, right, and top, and fills spaces between all the stanzas.  
                     The dominant form is perhaps the vegetation with flame-like leaves
                     that swirls in the spaces of the right margin (with a more
                     conventional leaf or two at bottom right), underneath the title,
                     and down the left margin.  Tendrils extending from both margins
                     help separate the stanzas from one another.  The vine right of the
                     final stanza on the plate has several loops suggesting a spiral. 
                     The vine full of leaves and flowers(?) that extends across the top
                     of the plate above the title and fills the top right corner and the
                     space right of the first stanza is distinct from the flame-like 
                     vegetation that dominates the rest of the plate.  Extensions of
                     letters in the title contribute to both forms of vegetation: the
                     initial "A" and "C" to the vine above, the "S" to both.  In the
                     text of the poem, occasional letters have modest decorative
                     extensions, and there are a few bits of stray decorative

                  a large leafy structure occupies
                  the space at the end of short line 5.  Below it is a leafy weeping
                  willow tree that leans right; its 
                  branches arch down into what may be water.  Between stanzas (after
                  lines 5, 9, and 13) and, in the right margin, at the ends of short
                  lines are other vinelike structures.  The initial letters of
                  stanzas 2, 3, and 4 have extensions that add to the decoration in
                  the left margin.  Several human figures populate

branches from two thin trees rooted at bottom left.  
Leafless below, the branches in the upper reaches of the margin

stanza 6.  The vine bears grape(?) clusters opposite stanzas 6 and
7, although in this copy they are colored green like the leaves. 
The letters of the title are ornamented with elaborate extensions
and flourishes.  The three capital letters, along with the "h" of
"Anothers," which is 
decorated with a kind of forked top above and a long flag below,
and the coil following the final "w," are the most notable.  In the
left margin is a lattice of branches from two thin trees rooted at
bottom left.  Leafless below, the branches in the upper reaches of
the margin carry the suggestion of leaves, and there are very loopy
tendrils beside the first three stanzas that may be a separate vine
or part of the tree.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="object" location="CD"><characteristic>shadow</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A narrow triangle of dark grey wash suggests a shadow

harp, before an audience of 
perhaps two children—standing in the middle of the group—and six
older youths.  He may be the 
bard of the title.  To the left stand two young females who
embrace.  To the right stand the 
two children and a group of three gowned females who face the bard. 
At their feet, facing them, 
kneels another female.  All the figures appear to be gowned.  The
scene is set outdoors on a strip 
of slightly inclined grassy ground with a dark shadow lower right. 
A palm-like frond arches over 
the head of the figure at far right and the vine in the left margin
of the text dangles down into this major design above the heads of
the embracing couple.  Blue and purple washes in the background
                  indicate sky, possibly with clouds.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="C"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>young</characteristic><characteristic>short hair</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised vertically</characteristic><characteristic>facing away</characteristic><characteristic>embracing</characteristic><illusobjdesc>At left stands an embracing couple.

middle figure.  At their feet and facing away from the viewer
kneels a fourth young female similarly dressed and coiffured.  She
