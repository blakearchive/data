In the center stands St. Paul, a gowned male figure with short, curly hair and a beard. He faces forward with his arms raised at 135 degrees, palms up. Both feet are visible beneath the hem of his gown. His eyes are raised and his mouth is open; he is presumably speaking. A radiance emanates from St. Paul, or from behind him, with beams of light extending through most of the design. St. Paul stands on a platform, reached by a set of stone steps. The background to the design is dark, and may represent a sky. On the bottom left of the design sit three gowned figures listening to St. Paul. The leftmost figure of the group is a woman with long hair. Her right arm appears to be at her side. She faces forward and looks up and to the right with her eyes raised and her mouth partly open. Her expression suggests awe or surprise. The middle figure of the group is an old man with long hair and a long beard. He faces right and looks up, with his legs bent and drawn up partly. His right arm is at his side but bent upward and on his knees he holds at least two books. The rightmost figure of this group is a male child with short, curly hair. He stands, facing right and forward slightly, and looking up with his head bent back. Both arms appear to be at his side, although the right arm is bent slightly. His mouth is partly open and his eyes are raised. His expression suggests awe or surprise. In the bottom right corner of the design sit three gowned figures. The leftmost figure of the group is a young woman with long hair. She faces left and looks up, with her head bent back as she listens to St. Paul. Her arms are at her side, resting on her lap. She appears to be smiling. The middle figure is a woman, facing forward. She has long, slightly curly hair. Her legs are bent so that she can hold an open book on her lap. Her arms are at her side but bent upward so that she can entwine her hands in a gesture of prayer or supplication. She looks up slightly and her mouth is partly open; she may be speaking in prayer. The rightmost figure is a male with slightly curly hair and a mustache. He wears a cloak or heavy gown and faces right, looking down.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>St. Paul</characteristic><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>short hair</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised at 135 degrees</characteristic><characteristic>palm up</characteristic><characteristic>feet</characteristic><characteristic>hem</characteristic><characteristic>eyes raised</characteristic><characteristic>mouth open</characteristic><characteristic>speaking</characteristic><characteristic>aura</characteristic><characteristic>radiance</characteristic><illusobjdesc>In the center of the design stands St. Paul, a gowned male figure with short, curly hair and a beard.
