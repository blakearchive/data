               <seriesstmt>The William Blake Archive</seriesstmt>
               <updatestmt> The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of a digital edition of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem The Emanation of The Giant Albion</hi> Copy F, from the Morgan Library and Museum. <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> is Blake's masterpiece in illuminated printing, consisting of 100 relief and white-line etchings divided into four chapters. It is his longest illuminated book and its plates are among his largest, at approximately 22.5 x 16 cm. Though dated 1804 on its title plate, it was not printed in its entirety until c. 1820. Sixty plates may have been completed by 1807; a few examples were exhibited in 1812. The printing of 1820 produced Copies A, C, and D. In the next year, Blake printed Copies B (chapter 1 only, Plates 1-25) and E. Blake printed Copy F in 1827. Copies H-J are posthumous. Most lifetime copies have hand tinting in gray or black, but only Copies B and E are colored. There are two arrangements of the plates in chapter 2, early (Copies A and C) and late (Copies D and E).<lb/>
                    <lb/>
                    Copy F has a fascinating history. It was the last copy of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> printed—as well as the last illuminated book— but its chapter 2 followed the early plate order of Copies A and C when delivered to its first owner—rather than, as one would expect, the later arrangement of copies D and E. Blake, or more likely his wife Catherine, sold Copy F to William Young Ottley for £5.5s on 11 August 1827—the day before Blake died. Blake apparently left the book uncollated on his deathbed. His friend and patron, the artist John Linnell, arranged and numbered the plates and added at least the hand coloring in Chinese white and perhaps some or all of the gray and black washes before delivering Copy F to Ottley on 16 Aug. 1827. However, Blake had begun to number the plates in pen and ink, 1-100, though remnants of these numbers appear on only 29 plates. Blake intended to order chapter 2 as he had in copies D and E, which is the order of Copy F in the Archive. Linnell either wrote over Blake’s numbers or rubbed them out and added the sequence of pen and ink numbers, top right. Linnell presumably used his own copy of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, Copy C, as the model for his numbering. The identity of the plates that Linnell altered, along with a thorough bibliographic description of Copy F and its provenance, is recorded in Copy Information, accessible under any image of Copy F in the Archive.<lb/>
                    <lb/> <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> Copy F joins the magnificently colored Copy E in the Archive and will eventually be joined by Copy A, whose plates in chapter 2 are arranged differently, and by Copy I, a posthumous copy, presumably printed by Frederick Tatham, who obtained the copperplates of Blake’s illuminated books after Catherine died in 1831. The Archive now contains fully searchable and scalable digital editions of 105 copies of Blake's nineteen illuminated books. <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> Copy F is among the first publications in the redesigned Archive, which is faster and easier to navigate, is aesthetically more appealing, and offers a more robust search feature. Users may view color corrected digital images of Blake’s works at their true size, and enlarge and rotate these images to examine the text and illustrations in detail. The images are accompanied by diplomatic transcriptions and editors’ notes, as well as illustration descriptions that make it possible to search Blake’s works for visual motifs. And, as noted, the Archive also provides full bibliographic and provenance information for each digital edition it publishes. <lb/>

                    restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible by the

                                   1821. In 1827, when Blake or his wife Catherine gave this copy to

                              includes gray and black washes and Chinese white on many plates. The
                              black washes added by hand are difficult to identify because it is the
                              same color as the printing ink. The most extensive use of black washes
                              appears on Objects 6, 78, 85, 87, 92, 93, and 95; the most extensive
                              use of gray washes appears on Objects 21, 25, 99, and 100. Some of the
                              hand tinting in black may have been added to compensate for weak
                              printing. The most extensive use of Chinese white appears on Objects
                              1, 39, 76, 84, 87, 99, and 100. The Chinese white, and possibly some
                              of the tinting in gray and black, were probably added by John Linnell
                              between the time he received this copy from Blake or his wife
                              Catherine on 12 Aug. 1827 and his delivery of the book to William
                              Young Ottley on 16 Aug. 1827. Blake is not known to have used Chinese
                              white in other illuminated books.</note></medium>

                         printed or covered with black wash.</etchednumbers>
                    <pennednumbers>1-28, 43-46, 29-37, 42, 38-41, 47-100<note>Blake began to number
                              the plates in pen and ink, 1-100, but remnants of these numbers appear
                              on only 29 plates. John Linnell either wrote over these numbers or
                              rubbed them out and added the sequence of pen and ink numbers, top
                              right, recorded here. He probably used his own copy of *Jerusalem*,
                              copy C, as a model for his numbering. Pencil numbers, 29-47, 49-58,
                              probably added shortly before the book was bound in the late
                              nineteenth century, appear top right on Objects 29-47, 49-58. Object
                              40 is also inscribed in pencil, "from another copy," but the presence
                              of the pen number "36," very probably in Linnell's hand, suggests that
                              this is not the case. Object 44 bears the additional pencil
                              inscription "44 - B.M." just right of Linnell's pen and ink number
                              "39." Apparently copy A of *Jerusalem* in the British Museum, or the
                              1877 John Pearson facsimile of copy A, was used as the model for
                              creating the present binding order of the plates, Bentley Plate
                              numbers 1-100. For a detailed explanation of Linnell's numbering, see

                         <illusobjdesc id="d0e436">A long-haired male figure, seen from behind but
                              facing right, steps with his right foot across the threshold of an
                              arched entryway whose interior is dark. The disappearance of his right
                              foot across the threshold may imply that he is stepping down onto a
                              stairway, perhaps, that leads to a crypt. With left arm bent upward
                              and fingers slightly spread, he appears to push and peer through the
                              heavy door, only slightly ajar, opening inward on the right. The
                              globed lantern in the figure's right hand and the shoe—which in copy E
                              is clearly a sandal—on his visible foot suggests that he is Los, the
                              watchman of the text, who, "Putting on his golden sandals" (Plate 83,
                              line 77), carries a "red Globe of fire" (Plate 85, line 20) in his
                              hand as he sings his Watch Song (Plates 85-86). The figure is clothed
                              in a long-sleeved, belted coat or tunic and wide-brimmed hat and
                              appears to be wearing a hard-soled shoe, perhaps a sandal, on his left
                              foot. The figure also appears to be carrying a round object that may
                              be a glowing disk or globe surrounded by radiating beams of light.
                              Inscriptions, later expurgated, on and above the archway in a proof
                              copy identify the structure framing Los as a sepulchral descent into
                              Albion: "Half friendship is the bitterest Enmity said Los / As he
                              enterd the Door of Death for Albions sake Inspired" (Erdman page

                                   be wearing sandals with straps around the calf, although the
                                   bands between his knees and ankles also suggest breeches; he also
                                   wears a long-sleeved, cinched coat or tunic whose bottom folds
                                   and hem swirl to the left and back, and a wide-brimmed hat. With

                                   door, which is slightly ajar. The figure's right arm is at his
                                   side; in his hand he clasps a circular, radiating object, whose
                                   transparency makes it appear as though his fingers simply

                                   his right foot across the threshold may imply that he is stepping
                                   down onto a stairway, perhaps, that leads to a crypt. The door is
                                   slightly ajar, opening inward on the right, and built into what
                                   in other copies is clearly a stone or brick wall, though its
                                   masonry in copy F is hardly visible. Inscriptions, later

                              features that inevitably suggest angels, but also birds, bats, and
                              flying insects, surround the title of the text. They may be among the
                              fairies mentioned in the first paragraph of "To the Public" (Plate 3).
                              Markings on the wings of the three figures at the top, bottom, and
                              lower right represent astronomical objects. Clockwise from the top are
                              a gowned, moth-like female flying in a horizontal position; a gowned
                              female flying in a standing position with her face hidden in her
                              hands, as if mourning; a nude female lying face up with her eyes
                              closed— sleeping or dead—her long hair stretched out above her head,
                              and her arms raised vertically; above her, sitting or squatting, a
                              gowned female with her head resting on her hand, as if mourning; and a
                              figure with less determinate features, though probably a gowned
                              female, flying in a near-vertical position. Perhaps all five of the
                              figures around the title are fairies acting in parallel to the main
                              action of the poem. Or perhaps the figure on the bottom is actually
                              Jerusalem ("Wingd with Six Wings" [Plate 86, line 2] according to Los)
                              sleeping the Sleep of Ulro while flanked by two mourning women. The
                              shading of the background may suggest a cloudy sky. An assortment of
                              human and animal figures appears among the letters of the title, and a
                              few of the letters have vegetative extensions.</illusobjdesc>

                                   otherwise long hair, have a rounded shape that resemble a moth's
                                   or dragonfly's. Their top edges are marked by indistinct shapes

                                   viewer. Like the other figures, she appears to be wearing a

                                   obscured by a hat whose points resemble flower petals, perhaps a
                                   sunflower's, topped with what may be ribbon or antennae (there is

                                   upward), have a shape that may be butterfly-like, though the
                                   thickness of their top edges suggests the wings of a bird or
                                   angel. The bottom set of wings is marked with stars; the top set
                                   is marked by a crescent moon and two shapes that may be stars,
                                   one above and one below the moon, both having beams of light

                                   figures with body-length wings and other features that inevitably
                                   suggest angels but also birds and flying insects. They may be
                                   among the fairies mentioned in the first paragraph of "To the
                                   Public" (Plate 3). On the left, a gowned female squats or sits on
                                   the extension of the "A" of "Albion," just above the supine
                                   figure. As if to suggest that she, like the figure opposite her,
                                   is mourning over the female below, her cheek rests on her left
                                   hand; she holds her right arm bent with the palm forward. Though
                                   her wings resemble those of the other two figures in the lower
                                   half of the plate, the configuration of hers may be more bat-like
                                   than theirs. Like the other figures, her wing is marked by a
                                   crescent moon and indistinct shapes that may be astronomical
                                   markings. Her long hair extends up and back into her wings, and
                                   her face is fringed with a pointed cap or hat—perhaps the points
                                   of sunflower petals or batwings on either side of her face—like
                                   the one that hides the face of the figure opposite her. She is
                                   dressed in the most detailed clothing of any figure on the plate.
                                   Her gown ends in spiky sleeves shaped like batwings, as does her
                                   collar. There are also spots near the hem of her layered skirt,
                                   or what may be an apron, which likewise ends in a spiky or
                                   scalloped pattern. She appears to be wearing a bracelet on her
                                   left wrist and a band around her upper right arm.</illusobjdesc>

                              inscriptions, "SHEEP" and "GOATS," at the top corners, though
                              technically he could have inscribed those earlier. Erdman reads the
                              deletions as follows (Erdman pages 145, 809n). Bentley generally
                              accepts Erdman's readings but offers them less confidently (Bentley
                              pages 419-20nn1-13) and reserves special doubts for a few, as noted
                              below.</p>

                              "arrogance.") Bentley is uncertain about the following words of
                              Erdman's transcription: "no Reader . . . presumptuousness . . . their
                              love . . . Writing, . . . who Acknowledge . . . Saviour and Lord . . .

                              interlinear designs. Midway down the plate on the left, a nude female
                              is one of three or four winged creatures flanking the verse portion of
                              the text (lines 22-33). Her legs are together, terminating in roots or
                              other vegetable matter rather than feet. Bat- or flame-like wings—or
                              spiky leaves suggesting a vegetative state—substitute for arms. Across
                              the way from her, to the right of the poem, are three more ambiguous
                              shapes, the topmost of which (to the right of and above "heaven" in
                              line 22) appears more bird-like than human. The lower figure,
                              following "desire" in line 27, is a miniature version, its features
                              less defined, of the female on the left side of the plate, and the
                              middle motif is an amorphous shape whose status, whether animal or
                              vegetable, is difficult to determine. Various other small-scale
                              vegetative motifs, for the most part extensions of letters, adorn the
                              text here and there, e.g., the serpentine flourish extending left of
                              the "T" of "The" in line 9 and the single-looped vine growing from the
                              "s" of "parts" near the bottom of the plate (line 46). The text
                              appears to be inscribed on cloud. In the upper corners of the plate
                              the words "SHEEP" (left) and "GOATS" (right) are integrated into the
                              design, as though written on fiery clouds displacing an otherwise
                              cloudy sky.</illusobjdesc>

                              and three stars, a robed or gowned and hooded sibyl sits between two
                              nude males and reaches out toward their heads. She grips the back of
                              the head of the male seated to the right. The male seated to the left
                              leans sharply away from the sybil, reclining against a rock and
                              raising his hands in a praying position. The three sit on a grassy
                              peninsula or island— perhaps a representation of Britain—that drops
                              off sharply, cliff- like, on the right, where water is suggested. To
                              the left of this group, curving around the "J" of "Jerusalem," is a
                              line of four flying figures. Below the uppermost of these—who reaches
                              down with one hand while pointing right with the other toward the
                              Greek words for "Jesus only" that are inscribed in the sky above the
                              crescent moon—two of the other figures reach upward toward her. Only
                              the upper body of the fourth figure is visible just above the rock
                              below the "J." The word "Jerusalem" is inscribed across the design in
                              a cloud.</illusobjdesc>

                                   tongue just visible. Stroking the serpent with her left hand just
                                   below the prominent crest on its head, the woman retrieves from
                                   beneath its head an indeterminate oval-shaped object with her
                                   right, the apparent transaction between the two suggesting a
                                   possible identification of the woman with Eve and, by extension,
                                   the serpent with Satan(?). In this vein, it is possible that the
                                   woman is giving the indeterminate oval-shaped object to the
                                   serpent; she may be feeding him, in a parallel to the above
                                   vignette which may be illustrating "the labour of the husbandman"
                                   (line 12). These associations are tentative: the serpent, for
                                   instance, may have an amiable rather than sinister aspect. Its
                                   undulations terminate in a coil at far right, where the creature
                                   merges with the vine descending from the tree

                              back so that his lifeless expression is clearly visible to the viewer.
                              The mourner to Albion's left kneels prostrate beside him, her
                              prominent right hand near his face. The mourner at right buries her(?)

                              folds of her garment. Three more females grieve at far left: two stand
                              weeping in identical postures, their hands covering their faces.
                              Interposed between them and the prostrate woman, another female, the

                              large size suggesting, perhaps, that they are falling to the earth,

                              human figures and a globe dominate the right margin. Two of the
                              figures are hovering in vertical positions: above, a gowned female
                              whose arms are edged with bat-wing-like or fish-fin-like appendages
                              raises both hands to the edges of her plumed(?), broad-brimmed hat; in
                              the middle, a vertical bearded(?) nude male reaches down with large
                              compasses as if to measure and draw the lines that are inscribed on
                              the surface of a globe. Below the globe a third figure, a gowned
                              female with her hair possibly pulled back or covered, kneels on a
                              solid surface. Facing away from the viewer, she reaches upward with
                              her right arm to indicate a point on the globe. The globe itself,
                              presumably the earth, is inscribed with latitude and longitude
                              markings—and with the ends of several lines of the poem that mention
                              points of the compass, including, prominently, "east &amp; west" (line
                              48). From the lowest point of the globe extends a spiral coil of some
                              sort. </illusobjdesc>

                         <illusobjdesc id="d0e6648">Against a background of clouds through which the
                              night sky occasionally appears, a nude(?) male with short hair lies
                              facing forward on his left side with his raised head resting
                              melancholically on his left hand, while his right arm lies along his
                              right side. His eyes are either closed or blank, like a tomb effigy;
                              both his head and feet rest against small mourning angels of the sort
                              one might expect in tomb sculpture. The left side of his body seems
                              unrealistically flat, as if partly embedded in the ground beneath. He
                              lies at the verge of a body of water marked by foaming waves,
                              especially near his elbow. Centered directly above him is a
                              long-haired, gowned female who flies or floats facing forward. The
                              small circles at her knees may be the "Bells of silver" at the knees
                              of Jerusalem, as described by Los (Plate 86, line 30), and the
                              six-segment configuration that surrounds her may be the "Six Wings" he
                              mentions earlier in the same description (line 2). If she is
                              Jerusalem, then the nude male is almost certainly the giant Albion. An
                              arch that in other copies is clearly a rainbow of six colored bands
                              curves above them both. Beneath the rainbow are clouds and the night
                              sky with six stars and a lunar sphere with a crescent at its
                              periphery. Above the rainbow are more clouds and, along the right
                              margin, two stars in the night sky. Against the clouds that envelope
                              the text, six cosmic objects that appear to be (clockwise from the
                              top) the sun, a ringed planet that is probably Saturn, the earth and a
                              crescent moon, and a light and a dark sphere that probably represent
                              other planets.</illusobjdesc>

                                   Blake's transparent garments. His eyes, though slightly raised,

                              bottom. He lies supine but turns clockwise toward the viewer, his head
                              resting on his right shoulder, and he appears to be dead or sleeping.
                              Flanking him are two pairs of mourners: the pair at far left kneels
                              just beyond Albion's head. Standing at the other end of the body,
                              beside the left foot, are two gowned daughters(?) who weep,
                              grief-stricken, their hands covering their faces (cf. similar scenes

                              (minus arms?) lies supine atop Albion's other thigh. The landscape of

                              plate, may represent the night sky. At the top two sketchily drawn
                              gowned females, their bodies horizontal, hover so as to meet head to
                              head, their raised arms bent up in front of their faces. Over and
                              behind them are numerous wavy lines, perhaps elements of the "web of
                              despair" mentioned in line 5; if so, the females are probably Vala and
                              Jerusalem and their gestures are those of despair. Between lines 12
                              and 13, on the left, similar lines give way to stars, moons, and a
                              moon-boat with sail—tilted to suggest a tempestuous sea—and, further
                              right, a comet with fiery tail. Below that, between lines 14 and 15, a
                              gowned figure, or perhaps two parallel figures, strain against the
                              traces attached to a whirling pinwheel of light, perhaps one of the
                              "Starry Wheels" (Plate 18, line 45). Two other parallel figures squat
                              to the right of the wheel and push it from behind. Behind these two
                              figures there is an obscure shape, perhaps another flaming comet or
                              star and/or perhaps the faint suggestion of a human form with no
                              distinguishable features except the outline of shoulders and arms.
                              Further to the right, against the night sky, a gowned female(?) with
                              long hair crawls left or hovers with her head down and her arms
                              extended in front of her, embracing what are most likely stars.
                              Several small roundish shapes, which in copy E are clearly stars,
                              appear above and behind her.</illusobjdesc>

                                   (lines 41-43). Looking back, the rightmost daughter, nude, runs
                                   or lunges left, hands clutching head, her long, flame-like(?)
                                   locks cascading behind her (though because the bodies of the
                                   threesome are closely pressed together, it is difficult to
                                   determine from whose head the locks cascade). Her left foot
                                   appears to be touching her pursuer's.</illusobjdesc>

                                   leftward; but unlike the other two, she appears to be lying,
                                   dynamically and expressively, on her side rather than running or
                                   crawling. Her body is twisted counterclockwise, lower body facing

                                   is bent, are raised vertically over her head. Strands of the

                                   versions—there is the suggestion, at least, of loops in some of
                                   the vines—right of lines 31-38 near the bottom of the plate. Some

                              outlines of clouds in other designs. The human figures begin at far

                              however. In any case, the line of figures includes at least six

                              shapes suggest that they are probably female; the long-haired figure
                              crawling above "Man" in line 13 seems distinctly so. The last three
                              figures at the right grow progressively less human in shape and blend
                              into one another until, at the right edge of the design, they seem to
                              become a simple intestinal tube that runs down the right margin and

                              of the plate at the end of the chapter, depicts a male figure,
                              probably Albion, tortured by three nude females arranged in pyramidal
                              fashion around him. The females are probably (clockwise from left)
                              Rahab, Vala, and Tirzah. From her victim's abdominal area Tirzah draws
                              out a length of entrails and winds them onto a skein she holds in her
                              left hand. This unweaving of the body relates Tirzah, as well as her
                              two companions, to the Fates of classical mythology who spin but also
                              cut the thread of life. Next to her, top and center, Vala spreads her
                              veil, canopy-like, over the other figures. Sitting on a stone at left,
                              Rahab looks down at Albion whose head falls back on her lap. He
                              appears to stare back at her, transfixed, his mouth slightly ajar.
                              Various celestial motifs are seared on Albion's body: an
                              anthropomorphic sun and moon decorate each thigh; three stars girdle
                              his loins; another constellation of stars appears above his left knee;
                              and two single stars decorate his right side, one on his shoulder, the
                              other on his leg just below the distressed-looking sun. Albion kneels
                              on grassy terrain, his legs spread; the two females flanking him sit

                              2, Hand and Jerusalem (their figures are labeled below)—he nude with
                              short, curly hair, she gowned with long hair—face each other in
                              darkness lit by swirling flames that envelope Hand's nude, cruciform
                              body. The flames form a halo about his head, coil serpent-like about
                              his raised arms, and send billowing smoke into the surrounding
                              darkness. On a floor of stone or bare earth, he strides left and looks
                              back right at Jerusalem, who strains her neck forward and holds her
                              hands out as if stopped in her tracks with her left foot forward.
                              Looking left in his direction, she bends her arms upward, her hands
                              raised with palms out toward Hand as if to repel him. The text of a
                              four-line poem is dispersed across the plate.</illusobjdesc>

                              center of a six-petaled water lily with two leaves against a
                              background of water and sky at sunset or night. The figures probably
                              depict "Jerusalem upon the River of his City soft repos'd / In the

                              lower bodies turn in opposing directions, left and right. The two

                              veil/hair of Vala (cf. Plate 25). The chapter designation, "Jerusalem.

                                   faces forward and right, wraps her right arm around the back of
                                   the right figure, and rests her hand on her partner's upper right
                                   leg; she wraps her left arm around the other figure's head; the

                                   (Plate 19, lines 43- 44). The lily has two large leaves in the
                                   foreground, and a vine-like tendril loops down into the left
                                   margin. One of the figures is probably Vala, whose metaphorical
                                   identification with the Lilly of Havilah helps explain why the

                              anthropomorphic hermit crab(?) with a pointed head and human body
                              after lines 11-14; a starfish or flower right of lines 18-19, below

                              seaweed, whose tendrils in turn extend to the bottom of the plate.

                              visible behind him, a nude male with short, curly hair kneels on one
                              knee on a grassy bank with his opposite leg extended forward to rest
                              on the lower surface in front of him. He faces left toward two winged
                              figures in flight. The middle figure, a forward-facing nude(?) female
                              with long hair streaming above her head, has elaborate wings that
                              suggest a butterfly, bird, or angel. Her arms are raised at 135
                              degrees, and her legs are apart in a position that approximates
                              running. Her head is raised slightly up toward the left. The legs of
                              the figure on the left are in a similar position, though he(?) faces
                              away from the viewer. His wings are bat-like, with the additional
                              suggestion of fish fins on his legs. The design likely represents "the

                              Jerusalem look upward at her as she and Vala look toward each other.
                              The daughter hovering on the right, seen from the rear, bends to look
                              down at her sister. In the lower left corner is a domed church topped
                              by a turret and cross in the manner of St. Paul's Cathedral; its
                              counterpart in the lower right corner is a Gothic church with spires
                              in the manner of Westminster Abbey; the church on the left is partly
                              in shadow. The background is dominated by layers of cloud, or smoke
                              and clouds. At the group's feet is an area of land with grass(?);
                              across the foreground are the waves of a river or sea.</illusobjdesc>

                                   independently at the ends of lines of text, but sometimes as
                                   letter extensions: e.g., following "over" and "traveller" at the
                                   ends of lines 14 and 15; or growing from or coinciding with the
                                   "t" of "tablet" at the end of line 17 and, in another instance,
                                   the ascender of "Human" in line 6. A solitary leaf(?) touches the

                                   lines 5 and 6 at left, but mostly in the lower right margin:
                                   after "joy" in line 35 and "Eternity" in line 40. Two spiky
                                   leaves grow down the right margin in the lower corner, attached
                                   to a vine or twig. Wing-like vegetable objects appear above "of"
                                   in line 26 and above "valley" in line 38. A strip of earth at the
                                   bottom of the plate continues up the right margin, becoming
                                   root-like; to a lesser extent, this motif is repeated in the left

                         <illusobjdesc id="d0e15544">Notwithstanding the intervention of a middle
                              text panel, the plate is organized as a single design; the fiery
                              backdrop integrates the upper and lower units of the design, its smoky
                              flames licking the spaces at the ends of lines in the text area. At
                              the bottom of the plate, a nude female(?) emerges from the abdomen or
                              ribcage of a supine, curly-haired male whose head is twisted nearly
                              180 degrees counterclockwise, facing down. His visible eye is open in
                              a kind of death stare. The flames enveloping the two figures seem to
                              radiate outward from the female, resembling a pair of ad hoc wings,
                              and the light of the fire, brightest near their faces, forms a halo or
                              aura around her, which seems to encompass the male (to a lesser
                              extent) as well. The woman appears to look up at the gowned,
                              curly-haired figure at the top of the plate who, seen from behind,
                              hovers among the flames with horizontally raised arms. The design as a
                              whole is usually thought to represent the creation of Eve from Adam,
                              described on Plate 42: "the Saviour in mercy takes / Contractions
                              Limit [Adam], and of the Limit he forms Woman" (lines 33-34). The
                              text, as well as the stigmata on the gowned figure's feet, point to an
                              alternative iconographical tradition in which Christ, not God, is the
                              creator of Adam and Eve. The recumbent, sleeping, and/or death posture
                              of the male and the flame-like wings of the female also suggest a
                              possible identification of the figures with Albion and Jerusalem
                              respectively.</illusobjdesc>

                                   bent back and turned to the right as she looks up toward the
                                   gowned figure in flames at the top of the plate. Her mouth may be
                                   slightly open. The flames enveloping the two attached figures
                                   seem to emanate from either side of the female in wing-like
                                   fashion, and the light of the fire is brightest around her face
                                   and head, giving a halo effect. The design is usually thought to

                              anvil that sits at the center of the design. Above the anvil is a
                              partial sphere shedding strong beams of light into the darkness to the
                              right and left. The nude male figure on the left bends so sharply
                              backward to swing a large hammer that he seems to be kneeling on one
                              knee. In a similarly extreme posture, the figure to the right of the
                              anvil, perhaps also nude and male, seems to flee away from the center.
                              The design may depict a scene in the "Furnaces of Los" (line 12): Los
                              is "Building the Moon of Ulro. plank by plank &amp; rib by rib" (line
                              5), and one of Jerusalem's "Children" is being "drivn by Loss Hammer"

                         <illusobjdesc id="d0e16393">The plate is evidently conceived as a single
                              unit, with the cloud-like panel of text and star-studded sky midway
                              down the plate integrating the upper and lower design components. At
                              the top of the plate, a gowned, Christ-like figure with long hair and
                              beard kneels on grassy terrain. Beams of light radiate from him,
                              creating an aura or halo effect. He looks down at a second male
                              figure, nude, whom he embraces and supports with his bent left leg and
                              extended right arm. The limp posture and insensible demeanor of the
                              nude figure suggest he is unconscious, injured, or dead. The pair
                              probably represent Christ and Albion, respectively, with reference to
                              Albion's despairing words on Plate 24: "Look not so merciful upon me O
                              thou Slain Lamb of God / I die! I die in thy arms tho Hope is banishd
                              from me" (lines 60-61; cf. Plate 48, lines 2-3). The two are flanked
                              by a palm tree (at left) and a large oak (at right), as described on
                              Plate 23, where Albion collapses "between the Palm tree &amp; the Oak
                              of weeping" (lines 25, 27). Albion's right foot touches a winged
                              sphere that spans the width of the plate. At the bottom of the plate,
                              Jerusalem lies supine on what appears to be a bier floating on the
                              sea. Her shroud-like wings double as a covering for the bier. Hovering
                              above her is the menacing spectre of the text (lines 3, 5), flanked by

                                   line (beginning "And One stood forth . . . ") was added by
                                   engraving (i.e., intaglio engraving rather than relief etching)
                                   after the plate was etched (Erdman page 810n); according to
                                   Bentley, the first 6 words were additions "engraved (not etched)
                                   in intaglio," the last four words "incised in White line"
                                   (Bentley page 495n). But the engraving or etching process is
                                   technically the same for white line and for intaglio; the
                                   difference is in the printing, whether from the surface of the
                                   plate or from the etched or engraved grooves. The addition might
                                   be more precisely described as follows: The first five words are
                                   printed in relief, with the surrounding area partly gouged out
                                   with an engraving tool to create a striated or mottled
                                   background—almost a gray tone. Most of the first letter of the
                                   sixth word ("the") continues with this technique, but the last
                                   two letters are defined primarily by thin white lines delineating
                                   the outlines of relief letters surrounded by a relief background.
                                   The last three words and the ampersand were engraved in white
                                   line within islands of relief surfaces that print black. If
                                   indeed all this work on both the letters and their contrasting
                                   backgrounds was executed with a tool rather than with acid, then
                                   the line was added after the initial etching of the
                              plate.</note></l>

                              at full draw, with left elbow high and on a line with the arrow he is
                              about to release, looks left and down at an indeterminate target. He
                              is mounted on an airborne horse, the twosome flying through a dark and
                              cloudy sky, through which a single white band of cloud breaks in the
                              upper left corner. The bowman faces backward while the horse heads
                              forward. Most likely it is the horse (but possibly the bowman or both
                              horse and rider) who is bat- or dragon-winged. Another pair of horses
                              seen in profile (mere outlines, though a foreleg of one is clearly
                              visible), as well as the upper ends of two more vertically raised
                              bows, suggests a cavalcade of horsemen, the scene as a whole perhaps a
                              representation of the Four Zoas taking up their fourfold bows and
                              arrows (see Plate 97, lines 8-12); in this network of associations,
                              the arc-shaped cloud would substitute for the invisible fourth bow,
                              twice described in the text as obscured by cloud: "clouds roll around
                              the / Horns of the wide Bow" (Plate 95, lines 15- 16; cf. Plate 98,
                              lines 5-6). The bows seem to do double duty as both supports for the
                              arrows and wings for the horses, thus literalizing the image on Plate
                              38 of "long winged arrows of thought" (line 16). A cloud of text is
                              superimposed over the sky motif of the plate. Rather than functioning
                              as interlinear ornamentation, the undulating marks between lines of
                              text (i.e., those between lines 12 and 13, 16 and 17, and 24 and 25)
                              give definition to (or suggest small breaks in) the cloud cover. At
                              the bottom of the plate, a giant sun rises above (or sinks beneath) a
                              gently sloping horizon, its beams washing across the cloudy

                                   the features of one are difficult to distinguish from the
                                   features of the other. Though not visible, the man's hands are

                         <illusobjdesc id="d0e20330">The designs in Plates 38, 40, and 42 may
                              constitute a sequence in this copy, though there are also other
                              analogous designs elsewhere in the work. Here, against a pale sky, a
                              grapevine extends up the right margin; grapes are visible at several
                              points along the edge of the design. At the top right corner is a
                              large cluster of grapes that a nude female reaches up to harvest(?).
                              She is supported by a column of six other figures in various awkward
                              and apparently uncomfortable positions. The weight of the entire group
                              rests on the back of a contracted figure at bottom right. A grapevine
                              with loops and leaves runs parallel to the column of figures just to
                              its left, ending about midway up the plate. Other fragments of vine
                              appear at intervals above it along the same side of the column.
                              Another vine appears in the lower left margin.</illusobjdesc>

                                   a sea with foamy waves. On the boat, taking up most of the space
                                   above deck, is a house-like cabin with a single small window near
                                   the visible peak of the roof. Vertical strips at intervals on the
                                   sides of the cabin suggest wood, and the white areas between make

                              branches that emerge from the earth to entangle the male. His overall
                              position is severely twisted, upper body facing down with head buried
                              in arms, lower body supine with legs raised. The bank or shore on

                              which the female hovers with arms raised horizontally. Her long hair
                              merges almost imperceptibly with the net fragments clinging to her
                              hands, fingers, and feet. The plethora of both textual and pictorial

                              flaming chariot with two riders against flames swirling in the
                              darkness—is complicated by its extraordinary mix of hybrid elements.
                              On a seat of flame the riders are a gowned old man with long hair and
                              beard seated beside a gowned and veiled(?) female, who may be Albion
                              with Vala or Jerusalem. The vehicle is pulled by two beasts with a
                              variety of features that suggest at a minimum bearded human beings
                              crowned with laurels, unicorns with spiral horns that end in human
                              hands, lions (manes), and oxen (bodies and hooves). On their backs
                              ride two winged creatures with eagle heads and human bodies, one
                              holding a quill pen(?). The yoke, harness, and wheel of the chariot
                              are made of serpents that terminate at the front in three serpent
                              heads that emerge from a kind of knot; from that point back it is not
                              clear how many serpent bodies there are. At the bottom of the design
                              is a strip of grassy(?) ground, partially obscured by shadow or
                              darkness at left and in the foreground. The flames from below extend
                              up into the margins of the text above to merge with the spare marginal
                              ornamentation. This design bears comparison to the one on Plate

                                   The birds after lines 21-23, 48-50 (perhaps an eagle), and 62-65
                                   are larger and more distinctive, with widespread wings and forked
                                   tails; they may be ascending in flight. The bird—or butterfly or

                                   appear to be a bat. There are bats, however—or butterflies or
                                   moths—after line 27, and probably after line 53. Flying insects
                                   are prominent after lines 33-38. The two larger ones may be
                                   dragonflies, the two smaller ones flies, bees, or moths. There
                                   are three other flying insects, the middle one of which (beneath
                                   "Human") may be a dragonfly, between lines 26 and

                                   as discrete fragments of vegetation. In the first stanza, there
                                   is a leaf-like extension on the "C" of "Cloud" at the end of line
                                   5 and a bit of vegetation under "Death" at the end of line 13.
                                   Between stanzas 2 and 3, there are elaborate extensions on
                                   "Beulah" (a branch), "Daughter" (a tree), and "Beulah" in line
                                   22; compare the rudimentary extensions that mark almost the same
                                   sequence of words—in this case a plural "Daughters"—in line 40
                                   below. Between stanzas 3 and 4, there is a mixture of looped
                                   vines, letter extensions, and the like. Similarly after line 31,
                                   there are extensions from lines above and below, including a leaf
                                   from the "s" of "afflictions" in line 32. "Tears" in line 32 is
                                   curiously connected by a squiggle to "West" two lines below.
                                   "[G]old," "Eight," and "every" in lines 36-38 have odd
                                   extensions. The one-line stanza at line 54 is set off by numerous
                                   decorative extensions on letters in lines 54 and 55 and by an
                                   especially elaborate extension from the final letter of "tears"
                                   at the end of line 54 that fills the margin in that area and
                                   sends a vine-like branch back between lines 54 and 55. After line
                                   57 this involved tangle of vegetation may include fruit, perhaps
                                   even a tiny mushroom.</illusobjdesc>

                              Plate 70, lines 2-16, which describes the "form of mighty Hand sitting
                              on Albions cliffs" (line 2). His shoulders "Bear Three strong sinewy
                              Necks &amp; Three awful &amp; terrible Heads . . . brooding
                              incessantly" (lines 5-6). He is said there to represent "the aggregate
                              of the Twelve Sons of Albion" (line 11), which "divide to Twelve: the
                              key-bones &amp; the chest dividing in pain" (line 13), "And there they
                              combine into Three Forms, named Bacon &amp; Newton &amp; Locke" (line
                              16). Thus a three-headed, three-crowned nude male with a melancholy
                              ("brooding") expression sits at the edge of a wave-swept island with a
                              grassy top surface and steep sides. Facing forward with his legs
                              half-immersed in the water, Hand sits on a flat surface at the foot of
                              the cliffs. From an opening in his upper chest emerges a serpentine
                              stream of other nude males, presumably Bacon, Newton, and Locke, who
                              hover against a background of flames that continue into the right
                              margin of the text above. The figure nearest Hand has two heads; from
                              an opening in his chest emerges a second figure from whom—though in
                              his rear-facing position his chest cannot be seen—a third figure
                              emerges. In the skies above the horizon on either side of the island
                              are contrasting scenes: on the left, streaks of rain, a bolt of
                              lightning and a sphere that may be a full moon; on the right, a
                              sunrise or sunset showing the sun partially visible at the horizon and
                              two other spheres above it, perhaps another sun and a moon with its
                              crescent visible at the top. Beams of light show against a dark sky
                              that continues up the right margin and across the top of the
                              plate.</illusobjdesc>

                                   a flat surface at the foot of the cliffs. His lower body is
                                   rotated clockwise to face left, while his upper body faces
                                   forward. His legs are in the water (hence visible only above the
                                   knees). His left head rests on his left hand and his right head
                                   on his right in a position conventionally associated with
                                   melancholy. From an opening in his upper chest emerges a

                                   Bacon, who sometimes associated himself with two-headed Janus;
                                   from an opening in his chest emerges a second figure. The body of

                                   right (or down and up, respectively). The lower part of his right
                                   leg disappears into Hand's chest (at least one leg of every
                                   figure is not visible from the knees down). His left leg is drawn
                                   up and his foot planted on Hand's face, as if to push from that
                                   point. A bit of his right arm is visible just above Hand's crown;
                                   his bent left arm is raised up over his left head and disappears
                                   behind the top of his right head. It is possible that this
                                   figure's two heads may in fact be the heads of two separate
                                   bodies, the rear one invisible below the neck.</illusobjdesc>

                              and was obscured by heavy inking that clogged its white lines or, in
                              copy F, obscured by subsequent hand coloring. See reproductions in
                              Paley, additional Plates iv (National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne)
                              and v (Fitzwilliam Museum), n.p. Essick, cited in Paley (page 211),
                              suggests that the Melbourne impression may have been originally
                              intended for Plate 51 of copy E. The Melbourne impression is printed
                              in the same orange ink as the other plates of copy E, while Plate 51
                              in copy F as we have it is the only impression printed in black. In
                              the Keynes proof impression (Fitzwilliam Museum), the figures are
                              labeled in white line (left to right, beneath) "Vala Hyle Skofeld"
                              (Bentley page 525n, Erdman page 811n). Erdman maintains that the
                              labeled version of the plate was "issued as a separate print" (Erdman
                              page 811n). See reproduction in Paley, additional Plate v (n.p.).</p>
                         <p>Like Plates 26 and 100, Plate 51 is composed horizontally.</p>

                                   up, knees apart, and her right arm is at her side; the tips of
                                   her fingers touch (or nearly touch) the ground. She does not

                              sits on top of a giant sunflower dais floating on a body of water. Her
                              wings, divided into three sets, do double duty as a throne, each of
                              the sets resembling the lateral extensions of a wing chair. The middle
                              and anterior wings, the latter of which seem to serve simultaneously
                              as a bustle to the gown, are relatively nondescript, in contrast to
                              the large-scale hind wings elaborately inlaid with celestial motifs,
                              including stars, a waning crescent moon (left) and a globe or planet
                              (right). The figure's upswept hair is built to great heights, with a
                              triple-tiered crown worked into it. Her elbows are propped on her
                              knees, chin resting in the palms of her upraised hands, and she
                              appears to be sleeping. The figure may be associated with Vala or
                              Rahab, but iconically she strongly resembles Jerusalem as depicted on
                              the title page and as described in Los's Watch Song on Plate 86:
                              "Wingd with Six Wings" (line 2) that spread like a "canopy" (line 10).
                              The identification is made more plausible by reading the chapter
                              title, "Jerusalem" (inscribed on the body of water at lower left) as a
                              caption to the design. Beams of light radiate from her
                              wings-cum-throne.</illusobjdesc>

                                   elaborately inlaid with celestial motifs, including stars (right
                                   and left), a waning crescent moon (left) and a globe, planet,
                                   sun, or full moon (right). The figure's upswept hair is built to
                                   great heights, shaped like a spire extending to the top border of
                                   the design; a triple-tiered crown is worked into her hair. Her
                                   elbows are propped on her knees, chin resting in the palms of her
                                   upraised hands, and she appears to be sleeping; her mouth is
                                   slightly open. The figure's attributes inevitably suggest an
                                   angel or a fairy, but also a butterfly, given her position
                                   nestled in the florets of the sunflower. Though often associated
                                   with Vala or Rahab, iconically she strongly resembles Jerusalem
                                   as depicted on the title page and as described in Los's Watch
                                   Song on Plate 86: "Wingd with Six Wings" (line 2) that spread
                                   like a "canopy" (line 10). The identification is made more
                                   plausible by reading the chapter title, "Jerusalem" (inscribed on
                                   the body of water at lower left) as a caption to the design.
                                   Beams of light radiate from the figure's

                                   flames are likely, but far from certainly, female. Of those only
                                   one—the figure furthest left, near the base of the clouds or
                                   flames at the border—may be gowned (and the suggestions of a gown
                                   may be aspects of the cloud formations on the figure's legs). The
                                   figure furthest left, near the base of the cloud or flames at the
                                   border, faces away from the viewer with right arm raised

                                   rising from the clouds. Then follow four other figures (left to
                                   right): a figure facing away with arms raised vertically, a
                                   figure facing forward with head up and left arm raised
                                   vertically, a figure facing away (with no arms visible), and a
                                   long-haired figure facing away(?), with right arm raised
                                   vertically and right leg bent forward. All the figures have their
                                   legs together. The three uppermost figures all twist their bodies
                                   clockwise to greater or lesser degrees.</illusobjdesc>

                              the full pubic area of a female seen from below—topped by a crop of
                              (pubic?) hair. It probably represents the "Hermaphroditic
                              Condensations" mentioned in the text (line 12). The design is loosely
                              unified by flames emanating from below and climbing the left and right

                              shapes of the flames nearest the lower surfaces of the creature's

                                   as a (rather fanciful) vagina—though perhaps it more closely
                                   resembles the full pubic area of a female seen from below—topped
                                   by a crop of (pubic?) hair. It probably represents the
                                   "Hermaphroditic Condensations" mentioned in the text (line

                              their textile work (lines 27 ff.): three gowned females gather round a
                              spinning wheel (a second wheel, or perhaps the winding reel mentioned
                              in line 27, is mounted in the background). The daughter at left
                              operates the machine with a foot treadle, a second daughter at right
                              assisting with her hands to keep the wheel going. At far right a third
                              daughter leans over her sister, one arm raised at approximately 135
                              degrees. All three women appear distracted by events presumably
                              occurring in the wings: the daughter at left looks left, each of her
                              sisters, right. The arm gestures of the outside pair are puzzling: the

                              at the bottom. It is difficult to specify what the giant's wide-eyed,
                              open-mouthed expression is intended to express: pain, perhaps, and
                              terror. His head is encircled with a worm-like coil; fanning outward
                              from his head are peacock feathers in the manner of beams of light

                                   figure, presumably male, whose head and fingers appear above the
                                   top edge of this surface and whose feet appear in flames beneath
                                   the text at the bottom. The giant figure grips the top edge of
                                   the surface; his head is tilted counterclockwise. It is difficult
                                   to specify what his wide- eyed, open-mouthed expression is
                                   intended to express: pain, perhaps, and terror. His upper teeth
                                   are visible, and his wide, oval eyes resemble the eyes of the
                                   feathers that surround his head. His head is encircled with
                                   worm-like coils; fanning outward from his head are peacock
                                   feathers in the manner of beams of light from a sun at the
                                   horizon.</illusobjdesc>

                                   where Los walks (lines 41-42). The fingers of a giant hold onto
                                   its top edge. At the bottom of the plate, smoky flames engulf the

                         <illusobjdesc id="d0e30002">Though widely separated by the expanse of text,
                              the upper and lower parts of the design seem, at least to some degree,
                              constituents of a single conception, as signaled, for instance, by the
                              continuity of the sky in the right margin. At top left, a gowned
                              figure of indeterminate gender whose long hair hides its face sits
                              sleeping(?) beside what is probably a cloud-table that is continuous
                              with the background of the text, which is washed and shaped, notably
                              along the right margin, to suggest a cloud formation. The cloud
                              supports a scroll that terminates in a spiral at far left. The
                              figure's upper body leans sharply left across the surface of the
                              scroll; in the foreground, the left forearm rests on the surface of
                              the scroll, as if the figure had fallen asleep while writing, though
                              no writing instrument is visible. Though the position of the right arm
                              is uncertain, it too appears to be extended along the surface of the
                              scroll. Around the figure's head and upper body is a bright area with
                              sharp beams of light defined against a secondary light background area
                              that contrasts with the darkness in the upper left corner, which is
                              continuous with the darkness in the background of the upper design
                              (and continues down the right margin). The figure's feet are hidden by
                              a strongly defined but unidentifiable, elongated intestinal or
                              wave-like shape at the top edge of the text block. Right of the
                              sleeping figure is the remainder of the scroll, supported at its upper
                              edges by two nude hovering figures, probably females. The scroll,
                              which has indecipherable marks on it, seems to continue across the
                              sleeping figure's lap into a long serpentine curve that extends almost
                              to the right edge of the design and then back left until it terminates
                              in a second spiral at the sleeping figure's knee. Beneath the text at
                              the bottom, a gowned old man with long hair and beard lies prone on
                              the ground with his head to the right; he twists his body clockwise to
                              face up. The toes of his right foot are visible. He lies on or beside
                              an open book; the index finger of his right hand marks his place in
                              the book. The position of his left arm and hand is harder to gauge,
                              but his arm seems to be bent so that he braces his body partly with
                              it; the lines that define his hand seem to blend with the lines of his
                              hair and beard. He looks up toward the sleeping figure at upper left.
                              The profile of this old man may suggest a hill or
                              mountain.</illusobjdesc>

                                   presumably a writer of some sort, perhaps a poet or scribe. The
                                   figure's long hair hides its face. The figure's upper body leans

                         <illusobjdesc id="d0e32057">The design at the bottom of the plate seems to
                              offer a tableau of the narrative of torture and sacrifice taking place
                              in Albion's bosom (Plate 65 ff.). Two nude women perform a ritual
                              dance(?) around an insensate nude male with shackles on his wrists and
                              ankles (he is perhaps fettered to the large rocks behind him). The
                              hair of each woman is twisted into a serpentine spike. Their arms are
                              raised horizontally: in their right hands they wield knives just above
                              the victim's head; in her left hand, the female at left brandishes a
                              face or head, and dangling from the left forearms of both figures are
                              what may be more body parts, possibly scalps. Although largely
                              obscured from view, another scalp(?) seems to ornament the breast of
                              the left female. Her companion balances a cup on the open palm of her
                              left hand. The shifting agents and recipients of torture in the text
                              make it impossible to assign stable identities to the figures; rather,
                              they most likely represent composite characters who are able to unite
                              and divide at will: the Daughters of Albion, Vala, and Tirzah are all
                              depicted with knives in the text of plates immediately preceding this
                              one (e.g., Plate 63, line 40; Plate 66, line 21; Plate 67, line 25),
                              and the cup is an iconic attribute repeatedly associated with both
                              Vala and Rahab, who become the spliced figure of Vala-Rahab on Plate
                              70 (line 32). Similarly, the object of the confused violence in Plate
                              65 ff. is sometimes Luvah, sometimes (or simultaneously) Albion, and
                              sometimes a more generic victim. In the background at right are
                              megalithic monuments of sundry size and shape. Other landscape details
                              include perhaps a bit of tableland in the foreground at far left. The
                              time is evidently night, as suggested by the celestial motifs: a
                              crescent moon and four stars of varying sizes.</illusobjdesc>

                                   to large rocks. She lunges left, but her head is turned clockwise
                                   to look back and down at the male. Her hair is twisted into a
                                   lethal-looking, serpentine spike, and her arms are raised
                                   horizontally: in the right hand she brandishes a knife just above

                                   with short, curly(?) hair. His arms are horizontally extended in
                                   cruciform posture across a cluster of boulders, to which his
                                   wrists and ankles are shackled (though only the shackle on the
                                   right wrist is discernible). He sits facing forward with legs
                                   drawn up; his right knee may touch that of his torturer on the
                                   right. His head falls limply back, nearly resting against his
                                   left shoulder; his eyes are closed; and his mouth appears to be
                                   slightly open, the overall demeanor suggesting unconsciousness,
                                   injury, and/or pain. The shifting agents and recipients of
                                   torture in the text make it impossible to assign stable
                                   identities to the figures; the object of the confused violence in
                                   Plate 65 ff. is principally Luvah, sometimes (or simultaneously)
                                   Albion (within whom the mayhem takes place), and sometimes a more
                                   generic victim.</illusobjdesc>

                              <note>The catchword "His" was etched on the copperplate—as printed
                                   here in copy F—but not printed in copy A, printed in copy C but
                                   changed on the impression in pen and ink to "And," and then
                                   printed in copies D and E. Bentley indicates merely that the
                                   catchword "His" "was erased from copy A" (Bentley page 571n). But
                                   the history seems complicated and reveals a possible change in
                                   the ordering of plates. Paley explains: "This copy bears the
                                   catchword 'His.' This was expunged from copy A, presumably
                                   because 71 begins 'And.' In C the catchword was altered to 'And,'
                                   further disguising the fact that 70 could not have been intended
                                   originally to precede 71. Wicksteed *William Blake's Jerusalem*
                                   216 hypothesizes that, since in the present foliation no
                                   subsequent plate begins 'And,' the present 70 must have been
                                   meant to come much earlier in the sequence. Plates beginning
                                   'his' are 6, 17, 19, 38[34], and 31[45]. According to the
                                   measurements in Bentley page 736, 70 could have been etched on
                                   the verso of 8, but even if that is the case it does not tell us
                                   the original place of the present 70 in the sequence" (Paley page
                                   247n).</note>

                              her is a nude male(?) who hovers facing away from the viewer with his
                              bent right leg extended backward. He may be headless, and in place of
                              his head is a worm-like upward spiral. The two figures may be the same

                              she has used her knife to decapitate him. Their actions take place

                              crowns—the figure at right clearly female, the other probably
                              male—seem to be (willingly) held in the coils of a seven-headed dragon
                              or serpent; alternatively their scaly lower bodies, only a small
                              portion of which the viewer sees, suggest that they are the human
                              heads and torsos of the beast. The female faces forward, her cheek
                              nuzzling one of the serpent's heads, which she fondles with her left
                              hand. Her right arm is bent upward, over a giant coil. She is probably
                              Rahab, presiding over the "Twenty-seven Heavens" (line 11), the final
                              group of which is represented in lines 16-21 in terms reminiscent of
                              the seven-headed beast and harlot (with whom Blake often identifies
                              Rahab) of Revelation (17.3-5). The male is seen from behind but faces
                              left, and he likewise appears to be embracing a serpent's head with
                              his right arm, of which only the upper part is visible; below his arm
                              is the backside of a third figure whose head, if human, is presumably
                              buried within the coils. All the serpents save one have open mouths,
                              the long, forked tongues of the outermost heads darting out, and
                              five(?) have prominent horns, as well. The monster's coils are marked
                              with intersecting circles that form loops and spirals, a motif that
                              links the lower design with the upper frieze of

                                   human figures caught in or forming its coils—perhaps the "Dragon

                                   darting out, and five(?) of the heads have visible horns, as well
                                   (some horns more prominent than others). The serpent in the
                                   bottom right corner has a curiously protruding (almost
                                   porpoise-like) forehead. Clockwise from top left, the serpents
                                   face up and left (first pair flanking the crowned male); left; up
                                   and right; again up and right; down and right; and down and left.
                                   The monster's coils are marked with intersecting circles that
                                   form loops and spirals, a motif that links the lower design with

                              hair stands on a strip of grass at the foot of a large tree looking
                              almost straight up at the body of a long-haired, bearded male, with
                              loincloth, very bright halo, and crown (of thorns?), crucified on its
                              branches. The arm positions of the two figures are similar. Nails or
                              spikes are visible in the hands of the crucified figure, whose eyes
                              are closed and whose head rests on his right shoulder, suggesting that

                              different copies. The tree, judging from its leaves and trunk, appears
                              to be an oak, and its fruit is thus presumably acorns, but their size
                              and shape makes them look more like apples, perhaps recollecting the
                              fateful tree in Eden. The scene is dark, as if at night; streaks of
                              light in the sky and a lighted area above the horizon on the left
                              suggest that the time is sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc>

                         <illusobjdesc id="d0e37027">Hovering and facing away from the viewer, an
                              indistinct nude female in the lower right margin raises her head and
                              left arm, around which something is coiled. Above her are two other
                              nude figures, a female who hovers in a sitting position with both arms
                              raised to hold a worm whose central portion is a male(?) human torso
                              facing away from the viewer. Its upper and lower extensions are
                              vermiform; the lower extension coils around the waist of the female
                              figure below and passes between her legs. Plate 82 reports that
                              sisters Cambel and Gwendolen, daughters of Vala, begin to transform
                              their lovers, Hand and Hyle respectively, from worms into male human
                              forms. The design here on Plate 80 seems to depict some aspects of
                              that process—either one transformation in progressive stages from
                              bottom to top or both transformations, one at bottom, the other at
                              top. The episodes on Plate 82 take place in "the Furnaces of Los &amp;
                              in the Wine-press" (line 65), which may explain the juxtaposition of
                              grapevines and leaves in the right margin with flames(?) along the
                              bottom edge of the design. (See, however, the descriptions of Plate
                              82, for the alternative possibility that the bottom edge may represent
                              indeterminate vegetation and the background an indefinite void,
                              perhaps underground.)</illusobjdesc>

                                   her knees bent and her body twisted clockwise. She holds her
                                   right arm at her side while raising her left arm vertically and
                                   bent right, perhaps reaching for something. An object—too
                                   indistinct to identify—coils around her left arm and emerges in
                                   an indistinct shape left of her hand. Her head has few
                                   identifiable features, though she seems to bend it back to look
                                   upward. Plate 82 reports that sisters Cambel and Gwendolen,

                         <illusobjdesc id="d0e37619">The design of this plate is dominated by a
                              large, light cloud, against which background the figures appear, and
                              which recedes in a seemingly infinite number of regressive layers,
                              suggesting a vortex. The cloud is also a portal, whose periphery is
                              inscribed with mirror writing (an ad hoc rectangular panel appended to
                              it contains the verse's concluding couplet). Gathered near its
                              entrance are twelve nude females. The scene shows Gwendolen (left)
                              conspiring with Cambel (right) to "entice" (Plate 82, line 19) the
                              other ten Daughters of Albion. Seen from behind, her hair wound in a
                              bun, Gwendolen stands with legs crossed at the base of the billowing
                              doorway, pointing toward it (or its text) with her right hand. Her
                              left hand, tucked behind her back and resting on her buttocks, signals
                              her deception: "Forgetting that Falshood is prophetic, she hid her
                              hand behind her, / Upon her back behind her loins" (Plate 82, lines
                              21-22). Listening to her sister, Cambel stands facing forward in
                              contrapposto, her left hand covering her genitals; the right, her
                              breasts. The remaining Daughters hover at right in two distinct
                              groups, the upper group of four in chorus-line formation, leaning
                              inward, the bottom group of six stacked in a way that suggests nesting
                              dolls. The daughters at bottom appear inchoate: with one exception,
                              their heads look disembodied. Two of the six daughters raise their
                              left arms vertically.</illusobjdesc>

                                   the two lines at the bottom of the plate has raised questions
                                   about their status: are they part of the text above the main
                                   design or are they, in effect, captions for the designs? Keynes
                                   prints the lines in a note but denies that they are "really part
                                   of the text" (Keynes page 920n). Bentley (page 598n), Erdman
                                   (page 812n), and Paley (page 267n) all treat them as simply the
                                   last two lines of text on the plate, though Bentley mentions that
                                   they could be an "afterthought" and breaks the page so that those
                                   two lines, though numbered continuously with the rest, do appear
                                   by themselves beneath the design. In Paley's edition the page
                                   also breaks at that point, though perhaps not with the intention
                                   of separating the last two lines from the text above.</note></l>

                                   the final word on the plate: "Whether given an exclamation point
                                   or not, this word seems to hang in mid-air"—and goes on to note
                                   the differences in "lettering, technique, content" that separate
                                   this plate from its successor (Erdman page 812n). He supposes
                                   that Plate 84 "obviously did not originally follow" Plate 83.
                                   Paley adds: "Although the lamentation of the Daughters continues
                                   from the end of 83, the last line of the latter does not lead
                                   into 84: 1" (Paley page 273n). A more satisfactory hypothesis is
                                   that "Awake" is a catchword, as its placement suggests, and that
                                   Plate 83 was originally designed to precede what is now Plate 97.
                                   In that arrangement, Jerusalem's decline at the end of Plate 83
                                   is immediately followed by a call for her to awake at the top of
                                   Plate 97.</note></l>

                              tears, the old man's eyes are closed or vacant. He walks in a hunched
                              position with crutches. Apparently in mid-stride, the child seems to

                              forward and down. The old man's back is profiled against a stone wall.
                              The wall and street are cut by strong shadows from the right. Left of
                              the wall, in the background, are icons of Westminster Abbey and St.

                              Enitharmon drawing out Los's fibres: "I will sieze thy Fibres &amp;
                              weave / Them" (Plate 87, lines 13-14; see, in general, Plate 87, lines
                              4-24 and Plate 88, lines 23-34). Los is seated at left with his left
                              leg drawn back under his thigh, buttock resting on his left foot. His
                              right leg is bent at the knee with right foot planted squarely on the
                              ground. His upper body is twisted clockwise to face left, and his left
                              arm is bent upward in a defensive gesture. Three long, vine-like
                              strands, which send forth leaves and bunches of grapes, are being
                              pulled from his body, one each from the areas of his left underarm,
                              his lower abdomen, and his groin. These three strands are held aloft
                              together in Enitharmon's left hand. She kneels with both knees facing
                              left, but she is twisted at the waist presenting her full back and is
                              seen in right profile. Her long, serpentine lock of hair streams to
                              the left. Both figures are nude. Enitharmon plies the three sections
                              of entrails, which morph into well-leafed vines of another variety in
                              her right hand (though the two sections are not continuous). Two more
                              vines similar in kind extend from her waist area. Despite their close
                              physical proximity to each other (their knees touch), the figures
                              appear temporally distanced: the sky behind Los is hung with nighttime
                              celestial motifs (crescent moon, comet, star, plus a vermicular cloud
                              at far left), while that behind Enitharmon has a blazing sun in the
                              upper corner, suggesting that it is full daylight.</illusobjdesc>

                         <illusobjdesc id="d0e40237">The half-plate design shows four contiguous
                              circles (two on top, two on bottom) which enclose two figures at left;
                              two more figures wander from their circles at right. The fourfold
                              structure (cf. the bottom design in <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>, Bentley
                              Plate 32), which are collectively referred to in lines 2-3 as the
                              "fourfold / Desarts," suggest the Mundane Shell or Egg. The figure in
                              the upper left circle is a nude, bearded male who lunges right but
                              seemingly looks left. His arms are raised horizontally as he pushes
                              against the walls of his sphere. In the circle below him are the
                              sketchy outlines of a face and upper body. The nude pair at right are
                              holding hands; the upper figure faces toward the viewer, his
                              companion, away. They most likely represent the youthful Los and
                              Enitharmon who "hand in hand like two infants wand[er] / From Enion"
                              (Plate 86, lines 63-64). The gowned Enion—disproportionally large with
                              respect to the other figures—stoops facing right in front of the lower
                              circles, groping blindly (line 2) for Los and Enitharmon with
                              outstretched arms.</illusobjdesc>

                              Jerusalem, sits on the ground, surrounded by the heads of four dead(?)
                              males(?), perhaps the Four Zoas. All the heads face upwards, eyes
                              closed; one, at Jerusalem's knee, is an old man with a long beard that
                              stretches along the ground in front of her. She may be looking down
                              toward him as she raises her arms upward from her bent elbows and
                              holds her palms up. In the grassy background a hilly horizon is marked
                              by three trilithons and one unidentifiable structure(?), perhaps a
                              hill. In the sky right of the seated female, the word "Jerusalem"
                              appears above two of the trilithons, perhaps naming simultaneously the
                              city represented by the trilithons and the woman in the foreground. In
                              the lower right margin, below the bearded head, there are two worms. </illusobjdesc>

                                   the leftmost head. Her right leg is apparently drawn up under her
                                   and her bent left leg extends backward. Her bare left foot is
                                   visible. Facing forward, her arms bent upward and hands raised
                                   with the palms up, she twists her body counterclockwise and bends
                                   her neck sharply right, perhaps to look down toward the bearded
                                   head at her left knee. A light area of sky creates the effect of
                                   a halo about her head and hands; in that respect she seems to
                                   represent the rising sun.</illusobjdesc>

                         <illusobjdesc id="d0e42698">The fiery upper and lower designs of the plate
                              are integrated by the flames licking the spaces at the ends of lines
                              in the intervening text panel. In the flames, three male figures at
                              the top of the plate kneel in a queue on their left knees and bend
                              forward, their right feet planted squarely on the ground (only the
                              outlines of the rear figures are discernible, but the threesome
                              clearly mirror one another in posture). They face right, differing
                              only in the orientation of their heads. Their arms are extended in
                              front of them, the right raised higher than the left to point directly
                              ahead at some indeterminate object in the wings or on another plate;
                              the left index fingers point down, perhaps in a denunciatory gesture.
                              They are identified by the inscription on their bodies, clearer in
                              monochrome copies, whose tripartite subject is distributed across
                              their backs (from back to front), and whose predicate and closing
                              comparative clause are written on the front and middle figures'
                              buttocks and thighs: "Anytus / Melitus / &amp; Lycon / thought
                              Socrates / a very Pernicious / Man / So Caiphus / thought Jesus".
                              Anytus, Melitus, and Lycon are the three men whose accusations
                              resulted in Socrates's execution, and Caiaphus is the high priest who
                              played a role in Jesus's death, but the iconography and language
                              simultaneously relate the three figures to the brothers Leigh, John,
                              and Robert Hunt: their journal, <hi rend="i">The Examiner</hi>, used
                              as its insignia a pointing hand, and an 1809 issue maligned Blake and
                              his exhibition in a review that claimed the artist's putative mental
                              instability had reached "a pernicious height." Together the three
                              pointing figures may represent the character Hand. At the bottom of
                              the plate a nude, long-haired female engulfed in fire reclines on her
                              left side. In front of her is an indeterminate structure, perhaps a
                              low wall. Alternatively, it could represent the side of a small boat,
                              a possibility consistent with the wave-like appearance of the flames
                              that lap across the bottom margin. The figure may be Enitharmon, who
                              "rais[es] her head" in line 10.</illusobjdesc>

                                   Anytus, Melitus, and Lycon, have now fallen. Together they may
                                   represent the character Hand (see the description of Plate 93).
                                   The foremost figure is lying on his left side, his upper body
                                   raised, its weight resting on his braced left arm. His body is
                                   twisted to face forward; his head is bent sharply back. His legs
                                   are together, with the top (right) leg bent slightly forward of
                                   the lower leg, and the foot of the right is crossed in front of
                                   the left, which extends upward in a shallow arc. Only the

                              lower design suggests a sunrise over a dark, slightly hilly landscape.

                              and the two trilithons on the right.) The rock may represent London

                              is the same as that of plate 92—Jerusalem. To the right of the rising

                              her. He looks down diagonally past her. Brittannia's lower torso is
                              turned toward the viewer while her upper body is twisted clockwise to

                         <illusobjdesc id="d0e44504">A curly-haired male figure, nude and seen from
                              behind, is poised at the edge of a grassy cliff or at the apex of a
                              hill. He steps forward with his right leg, his left extended backward.
                              In his left hand he holds a globed object, from which emanate intense
                              rays of light; he raises his right arm and hand, as if to shield his
                              eyes from the glare. The disk does double duty as a rising sun,
                              displacing the night sky indicated at right by a waning crescent moon
                              and a single star. The figure is most likely Los as watchman,
                              repeatedly represented in text and designs with a glowing disk
                              functioning as a lantern or sun (or both)—cf. the designs on Plates 1
                              and 73, and Los's Watch Song (Plates 85-86).</illusobjdesc>

                              curly hair and visible genitals, stands facing forward in
                              contrapposto. He is presumably Los, identified by the large hammer
                              that he holds in his right hand and large tongs in his left. Left of
                              Los, facing away from the viewer, a short-haired nude male(?) hovers,
                              holding a globe that may be the sun on his left shoulder. He may be
                              Los's spectre. On the right a nude female, her hair pulled back,
                              stands in contrapposto. She may be Enitharmon, Los's emanation. Her
                              body is turned away from the viewer as she faces left, looking either
                              at her work in her left hand or at one or both figures to her left.
                              Raising her arms at 135 degrees, she holds a distaff or a spindle in
                              her left hand. Multiple lines, suggestive of the "fibres" of
                              generation, hang from her right hand and extend down to a crescent
                              moon at the level of her waist. At the moon the threads multiply as
                              they extend from the moon down to the earth below. Behind the figures,
                              a serpentine line of trilithons winds, like a long wall, across a dark
                              landscape dominated by what may be a single hill in the center. The
                              line of trilithons, which may represent one of the "Serpent Temples"
                              mentioned on Plate 80, line 49, forms a larger circle on the central
                              hilltop and smaller loops approximating circles at each end. The
                              background is a dark sky, broken by stars and moon on the right and
                              what may be the sun on the leftmost figure's shoulder.</illusobjdesc>

                                   figures, a serpentine line of trilithons winds, like a long wall,
                                   across a grassy, hilly landscape. The line of trilithons, which
                                   may represent one of the "Serpent Temples" mentioned on Plate 80,
                                   line 49, forms a larger circle on the central hilltop and smaller
                                   loops approximating circles at each end. The circular arrangement
                                   of trilithons may recall Stonehenge. These are the last of
                                   several trilithons in the designs for <hi rend="i"
