                                                  <illusobjdesc>Two figures, both probably gowned
                                                  and with arms extended horizontally, hover below
                                                  the first line of text. Their directional
                                                  orientation is uncertain; we may be seeing them
                                                  from behind. Below the figure on the left in this
                                                  pair are three very small hovering figures. The
                                                  right-most figure in this group appear to have her
                                                  or his arms raised at 135 degrees. The central
                                                  figure may have one arm raised at 45 degrees. The
                                                  companion group on the right includes three
                                                  (gowned?) and hovering figures, with the head of a
                                                  fourth figure just visible above and to the left
                                                  of the central figure in this group. The left-most
                                                  figure has one arm raised horizontally and the
                                                  other vertically. Below "Gates" (line 3) in the
                                                  title, and on each side of the word "of" (line 4),
                                                  are two hovering angels with large wings. Both
                                                  have their arms bent with their hands together in
                                                  an attitude of prayer. The angel on the left faces
                                                  right; the angel on the right faces left. There
                                                  are slight indications of a gown worn by the angel
                                                  on the left. They may be looking down at a portion
                                                  of the circumference of sun arcing between "of"
                                                  and "Paradise" (line 5) in the title. Lines of
                                                  radiance emanate from the arc, suggesting a
                                                  sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc>

                                                  <illusobjdesc>A large tree grows up the left
                                                  margin, with branches arching toward the left in
                                                  the top third of the image. Its long, dangling
                                                  branches and/or leaves suggest it may be a willow.
                                                  A few small plants with large leaves cover the
                                                  ground below the trunk. To the right, below the
                                                  tree's largest branch, is a gowned woman striding
                                                  to the left with legs spread apart. Her hair is
                                                  drawn into a bun on the back of her head. Her left
                                                  arm is bent at the elbow and she holds in her left
                                                  hand two small children or infants. We see only
                                                  one child's head and the right eye and cheek of
                                                  the other; a part of the woman's gown, or a
                                                  separate blanket, covers the children's bodies.
                                                  The woman, perhaps the children's mother or a
                                                  nurse, leans over and faces down. She reaches down
                                                  with her right arm and hand and appears to be
                                                  pulling a third child or infant out of the earth.
                                                  We see this child only from the chest up; his or
                                                  her hair stands on end. The position of the child
                                                  suggests that it is the anthropomorphic form of a
                                                  vegetable, perhaps a mandrake, traditionally
                                                  thought to be shaped like a human body. Perhaps
                                                  the woman has "harvested" the other two children,
                                                  held in her left arm, in a similar fashion. Plants
                                                  or trees fill the middle distance right of the
                                                  woman; trees and a low hill fill the middle
                                                  distance left of the woman. A few clouds fill the
                                                  sky behind the tree's limbs and
                                                  leaves.</illusobjdesc>

                                                  suggest despair or melancholy. To the right is a

                                                  figure. There are several large roots beneath its
                                                  trunk. Other lines, almost vertical but slightly
                                                  angled from right to left, cover most of the image
                                                  and very probably represent rain. A river or lake
                                                  appears lower left and below the man's feet. As

                                                  curly (almost snake-like) hair, stands facing
                                                  forward. Two rounded forms in his hair hint at
                                                  horns. His legs are spread apart and his arms
                                                  raised at approximately 135 degrees. His right arm
                                                  is slightly bent. He holds a spear in his right
                                                  hand; a large shield is buckled to his left arm
                                                  and hand. Scales cover his lower stomach and
                                                  genitals. His mouth is slightly open and his eyes
                                                  are closed or almost closed. Flames fill the
                                                  background of the design and rise over the
                                                  figure's right lower leg. There are also scales
                                                  among the flames on each side and above the
                                                  figure. The figure and his setting suggest both
                                                  Blake's Orc (frequently associated with fire) and
                                                  Milton's Satan in hell. The caption indicates that

                                                  spread, from left to right. He wears tights or a
                                                  combination of breeches and a shirt. His hair is
                                                  curly. He faces to the right, with a look of
                                                  surprise or excitement on his face. His left arm
                                                  is at his side; his right arm is raised vertically
                                                  but slightly bent at the elbow. He holds a hat in
                                                  his raised right hand. To the right of his face is
                                                  a (nude and male?) human figure, perhaps an infant
                                                  or child, hovering (flying?) in mid-air. We see
                                                  this figure, also with curly hair, from the back,
                                                  but facing to the left (toward the large figure).
                                                  His legs are spread, as though fleeing from the
                                                  youth with a hat, who may be pursuing him. The
                                                  hovering figure has his arms extended
                                                  horizontally. Below, on the ground in the lower
                                                  right corner of the design, is a second diminutive
                                                  figure of uncertain gender. He or she may be dead
                                                  and lies face-down, with the right leg extended
                                                  and arms extended horizontally in a cruciform
                                                  position. His or her hair is long. Given the
                                                  positioning of these two small figures and the
                                                  iconographic tradition from which this design may
                                                  have been developed, the two small human forms may
                                                  be personifications of birds or butterflies; the
                                                  inscription below the image suggests a more
                                                  specific identification within the context of
                                                  Blake's own mythic creations. The middle distance
                                                  is dominated by leafy plants or trees. Clouds fill

                                                  an infant or child, hovering (flying?) in mid-air.
                                                  We see this figure with curly hair from the back,
                                                  but facing to the left (toward the large figure).
                                                  His legs are spread, as though fleeing from the

                                                  <illusobjdesc>On the left, a youthful male with
                                                  curly hair strides to the left. Although basically
                                                  pictured as a nude, a small piece of drapery seems
                                                  to extend over his buttocks and to the right of
                                                  his left thigh. His body is twisted and he faces
                                                  to the right, toward a bearded man. The youth's
                                                  right arm is raised horizontally and he may be
                                                  pointing toward this older man. His left arm is
                                                  raised vertically; he grasps a spear or dart in
                                                  his raised left hand. He may be about to throw his
                                                  weapon at the old man. To the right sits an old
                                                  man with long hair and a long beard. He may be
                                                  wearing tights or armor. His left leg is bent at
                                                  the knee, his right extended to the left. His left
                                                  arm is bent at the elbow and he props his head on
                                                  his left hand--a posture traditionally indicative
                                                  of melancholy. His body is twisted and he looks
                                                  down and to the right. His right arm is raised
                                                  horizontally and he grasps a large sword in his
                                                  right hand. The positioning of the two figures and
                                                  their relative ages suggest that the youth is an
                                                  Orc- like figure and the old man is his father, as
                                                  well as a king or Urizen figure. The caption, if
                                                  spoken by the old man, indicates that the youth is
                                                  his child. The old man's chair (a primitive
                                                  throne?) is constructed of large stones. The back
                                                  of the chair is also constructed of stones.
                                                  Alternatively, if the perspective is distorted,
                                                  this may be a ruined wall and the "chair" part of
                                                  the wall or building. A large tree with several
                                                  leafy branches arches above the old man. We see a
                                                  low hill, a mountain behind and to the right, and
                                                  clouds in the sky on the left. The earth in the
                                                  foreground may be covered with
                                                  grass.</illusobjdesc>

                                                  strides to the left. Although basically pictured
                                                  as a nude, a small piece of drapery seems to
                                                  extend over his buttocks and to the right of his
                                                  left thigh. His body is twisted and he faces to
                                                  the right, toward an old, bearded man. The youth's
                                                  right arm is raised horizontally and he may be
                                                  pointing toward the bearded man. His left arm is
                                                  raised vertically; he grasps a spear or dart in
                                                  his raised left hand. He may be about to throw his
                                                  weapon at the old man. The relative positions and
                                                  ages of the figures suggest that the youth is an
                                                  Orc figure. If the caption is spoken by the old
                                                  man, then the youth is his child.</illusobjdesc>

                                                  an old man with long hair and a long beard. He may
                                                  be wearing tights or armor. His left leg is bent
                                                  at the knee, his right extended to the left. His
                                                  left arm is bent at the elbow and he props his
                                                  head on his left hand--a posture traditionally
                                                  indicative of melancholy. His body is twisted and
                                                  he looks down and to the right. His right arm is

                                                  apparently holding the vertical sides of the
                                                  ladder. The figure is probably male; he wears a
                                                  hat and may be looking to the right. In the far
                                                  right corner is a group of two figures, probably a
                                                  woman on the left (wearing a dress or skirt) and a
                                                  man on the right. The man has at least his left
                                                  arm raised horizontally; he may be embracing the
                                                  woman around her waist. The woman's right arm is
                                                  bent at the elbow, with her forearm raised
                                                  horizontally. Both these figures appear to be
                                                  facing to the left and looking at the man climbing
                                                  the ladder; the woman may be pointing at
                                                  him.</illusobjdesc>

                                                  emblem of Age clipping the wings of Love. On the
                                                  left sits a gowned old man wearing spectacles (an
                                                  indication of limited vision). He has a long beard
                                                  and probably long hair. His eyes are closed or
                                                  looking down; he may be blind or almost blind. His
                                                  mouth is open slightly. His legs, with prominent
                                                  knees, are crossed at the ankles. His left arm is
                                                  raised horizontally, with the left hand grasping
                                                  the wing of the youthful figure to the right. His
                                                  right arm is bent at the elbow; he holds in his
                                                  right hand a pair of scissors with which he is
                                                  about to cut the tip of the youth's right wing.
                                                  This winged and youthful male figure, nude and
                                                  striding energetically to the right, is a winged
                                                  Cupid, cherub, or angel. His legs are spread
                                                  apart, as though running to the right; he may be
                                                  fleeing from the old man. The youth's hair is
                                                  curly. His right arm is bent upward at the elbow,
                                                  with the fingers of his raised right hand spread
                                                  apart. His body faces to the right, but we see
                                                  only the back of his head as he looks back to the
                                                  sun rising or setting on the distant horizon.
                                                  Lines of radiance emanate from the sun. A tree,
                                                  its branches arching over both figures, grows up
                                                  the left margin. The leaves of a tree or large
                                                  plant fill the background above the old man. There
                                                  may be grass on the slight hill or mound on which
                                                  the two figures are placed.</illusobjdesc>

                                                  <illusobjdesc>Within a small room, probably a
                                                  prison cell built of stone, we see five seated
                                                  male figures, all apparently nude (with the
                                                  possible exceptions of the figures lower left and
                                                  right). The central figure, facing forward, is old
                                                  and bearded with hair standing on end; the others
                                                  are much younger. He, and the two figures next to
                                                  him, appear to be sitting on a low stone step.
                                                  There may be three small windows above them. The
                                                  larger, older central figure has his legs drawn
                                                  up; his knees are very prominent. His face
                                                  suggests despair or worse. Immediately to the
                                                  left, very close to the old man, is a young man
                                                  with legs drawn up and crossed at the ankles. His
                                                  knees are also prominent. His body faces forward,
                                                  but his head is turned up and to the right; he may
                                                  be looking at the face of the old man. Although we
                                                  see only his right shoulder and upper arm, his
                                                  right arm may be extended horizontally; he may be
                                                  embracing the old man. On the right is another
                                                  young male close to the old man. His legs are
                                                  drawn up and crossed at the ankles, with prominent
                                                  knees. His body faces forward, but his head is
                                                  turned to the left, with his face pressed against
                                                  the body or left leg of the old man. This figure's
                                                  hair seems to be long. Another youthful male sits
                                                  in the right foreground. His legs are extended but
                                                  slightly bent at the knees. Although probably
                                                  nude, like his companions, lines just below his
                                                  knees suggest that he might be wearing breeches.
                                                  His left arm is at his side, with his left hand on
                                                  the ground (or, rather, on the floor), fingers
                                                  spread apart. He faces left, with his head bent
                                                  back and looking up; his mouth is slightly open.
                                                  His hair is probably long. In the left foreground
                                                  is the final youthful figure, seated and with legs
                                                  extended. Though he may be nude, lines just below
                                                  his knees suggest that he, too, may be wearing
                                                  breeches. He faces to the right, with his head
                                                  down. His right arm is at is side, with his right
                                                  hand on the ground (or, rather, on the floor),
                                                  fingers spread. His hair is curly. Given the
                                                  configuration of the males, the setting, and the
                                                  compositional relationship to several drawings by
                                                  Blake, this design would seem to be inspired by
                                                  Dante's description of Count Ugolino and his sons
                                                  in prison.</illusobjdesc>

                                                  <illusobjdesc>We see the corner of a featureless
                                                  chamber or cell, perhaps with stone walls and a
                                                  wooden floor. The only furniture is a bed (or
                                                  possibly a bier), probably made of wood. A
                                                  body--very probably dead--lies supine and rigid on
                                                  the bed, legs together and at least the right arm
                                                  at his side. This gowned figure is very probably
                                                  an old man, as indicated by his long beard. His
                                                  face is hidden by another figure. At his feet,
                                                  rising into the air at a 45 degree angle from
                                                  lower right to upper left, is another gowned and
                                                  bearded old man. We can see the supine figure's
                                                  feet through the lower leg of the rising figure,
                                                  and thus he is almost certainly the ghost or
                                                  spirit of the dead man. His hair is long and he
                                                  faces to the left. His right arm is bent at the
                                                  elbow with the forearm raised horizontally across
                                                  his body. The index finger of his right hand is
                                                  extended and points to the right. His left arm is
                                                  bent at the elbow with the forearm raised
                                                  vertically. One finger of his left hand points
                                                  upward. A radiant light surrounds his head and
                                                  body, extending down to his lower legs. The effect
                                                  is particularly prominent around his head and
                                                  strongly suggests and halo. Beams of light radiate
                                                  from his aura on the left. In the foreground on
                                                  the left is a young man with curly hair. He squats
                                                  or sits on his left leg, bent under his body; his
                                                  right leg is extended to the right and bent
                                                  slightly at the knee. He may be wearing tights, or
                                                  at least a belt around his waist. His right arm is
                                                  at his side, with the fingers of his right hand
                                                  spread apart. His mouth is slightly open and he
                                                  appears to be looking up and to the right in fear
                                                  or surprise at the ghostly figure above and to the
                                                  right. He may be the son of the dead man. Behind
                                                  the bed and its corpse we see the head and upper
                                                  body of a gowned woman wearing a scarf over her
                                                  head. Her left arm is extended at 45 degrees. She
                                                  also looks up and to the right at the ghost,
                                                  perhaps with an expression of fear or surprise.
                                                  She may be the wife or daughter of the dead man.
                                                  Behind her and to the right are two small figures,
                                                  probably children or grandchildren of the dead
                                                  man. Of the child closest to the woman we see only
                                                  the face. The child faces toward the viewer. The
                                                  child farthest to the right in this group is
                                                  probably a male with curly hair. We see only his
                                                  face and upper chest. He is probably looking up
                                                  and to the right at the ghost.</illusobjdesc>

                                                  from lower right to upper left, is another gowned
                                                  and bearded old man. We can see the supine

                                                  the ghost or spirit of the dead man. His hair is
                                                  long and he faces to the left. His right arm is
                                                  bent at the elbow with the forearm raised
                                                  horizontally across his body. The index finger of
                                                  his right hand is extended and points to the

                                                  forearm raised vertically. One finger of his left
                                                  hand points upward. A radiant light surrounds his
                                                  head and body, extending down to his lower legs.
                                                  The effect is particularly prominent around his
                                                  head and strongly suggests and halo. Beams of

                                                  knees, upon the earth. The figure, who faces
                                                  forward, has a scarf or hood over his or her head.
                                                  Arms at side, the figure holds a slender staff in
                                                  the right hand. The left hand is on the ground.

                                                  directly at the viewer. A worm lies on the ground,

                                                  graves below the seated figure. The front-most

                                                  leafless limbs, trunks, and roots of trees. There
                                                  may also be a small plant, lower left, large

                                                  <illusobjdesc>We see from behind a bat-winged
                                                  figure, almost certainly male, flying or hovering
                                                  in the air. He faces away from the viewer and is
                                                  dark-skinned, nude and bald. His arms are
                                                  apparently raised horizontally, for we can see his
                                                  hands, fingers spread apart, extending beyond each
                                                  wing. His right leg is drawn up behind him, his
                                                  left bent slightly at the knee but extended to the
                                                  left. At least ten stars and two circles decorate
                                                  his wings. The circle on the left is probably the
                                                  moon (note the slight indications of a crescent
                                                  within the circle); the circle on the right may be
                                                  the sun (note the radiance just outside the
                                                  circumference). This figure is no doubt Satan,
                                                  "The Accuser who is The God of This World," named
                                                  in the first three lines of the text on this
                                                  plate. He can also be associated with Blake's
                                                  concept of the spectre. Lying supine on the ground
                                                  beneath the winged figure is the "lost Traveller"
                                                  named in line 10. He is a muscular male and would
                                                  appear to be nude; his hair is long. His eyes are
                                                  closed, for he is very probably asleep and
                                                  dreaming (see line 10). His neck is twisted so
                                                  that he faces forward. His head may be resting on
                                                  a stone or mound of earth and his legs may be
                                                  crossed at the ankles. His right arm is at his
                                                  side, with his right arm holding (or at least
                                                  resting on) a staff or walking-stick. The
                                                  background landscape on the right is filled with a
                                                  hill (see the last word on this plate) and radiant
                                                  beams of light (a sunrise or sunset?) rising above
                                                  the hill. On the left, the beams of light may be
                                                  issuing from the background horizon, but they also
                                                  form a halo-like radiance above the traveler's
                                                  head.</illusobjdesc>

                                                  forward. His head may be resting on a stone and
                                                  his legs may be crossed at the ankles. His right
