                    <illusobjdesc>The composition depicts the effigy of Countess Aveline in Westminster Abbey seen from above. Although oriented vertically here, the figure of Countess Aveline lies recumbent with body horizontal on a rectangular coffin lid. She wears a wimple and a gown, beneath which both of her feet are visible. Her eyes are closed and two small sections of curly hair are visible beneath her head covering. Her arms are at her side but bent upward to rest on her chest where her hands are together, perhaps in a gesture of prayer. The tops of her hands appear to be missing from the sculpture. The head of the Countess rests on a pillow, and two small winged angels are visible on either side of her head near the top of the composition. Both angels have short curly hair and appear to be male. Both turn their heads to look up. The angel at left faces right and forward, and his right leg appears to be bent beneath his gown. He may a cape or additional drapery over his gown. His left arm is extended horizontally to the right but appears to be broken out just above the elbow. His right arm is similarly missing at the shoulder. The angel at right faces left and forward. Additional drapery is visible around his left hip. His left arm is extended forward and appears to touch the Countess. His right arm is extended horizontally along the top edge of the pillow and may also touch the head of the Countess. Two small dogs lie facing one another at the feet of the Countess near the bottom of the composition. The dog at right lays its head atop the head of the dog at left.</illusobjdesc>
