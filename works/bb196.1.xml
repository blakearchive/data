However, at the very least, leaves 2 and 3 were once joined.  This is evidenced by the appearance on object 5 of the missing "e" of "Shame" and the top of the letter "l" from "Smouldring", words which are written on object 4.  These leaves were still intact at the time in which William Michael Rossetti made editorial marks and notes upon the manuscript (described below) in the early 1900s.  A slash mark made by Rossetti in red ink is divided between objects 4 and 5.  At some point in the manuscript's history, the leaves were mounted on larger leaves/mats.  Yet, since the publication of Bentley's <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> (in which this mounting is described) in 1977, the leaves have been removed from their mats by the New York Public Library and placed in Mylar sleeves. The abrupt opening of "then She bore Pale desire" and the fact that the first word in the manuscript is not capitalized suggest that there were once leaves preceding object 1 that are now missing.</note></numberleaves><leafsize>19.0 x 12.0 cm.</leafsize><medium>pen and ink, pencil <note>Marks and notes in red ink (which are not reproduced in this transcription) were made by William Michael Rossetti, the first editor of the manuscript, as he readied it for publication in or before 1903.

William Michael Rossetti acquired it from John Defett Francis in or around 1876.  In 1898, Rossetti sold the manuscript to Frank William Burgess for £12.  However, while Burgess obtained the manuscript, he never paid for it, and after his death in 1899, his widow returned it to Rossetti.  Rossetti's daughter, Helen Rossetti-Angeli, sold the manuscript at Sotheby's on 27 March 1929 (lot 529, £440), where it was purchased by the dealer Walter T. Spencer.  It was eventually acquired by Owen D. Young who, along with Dr. Albert A. Berg, presented it to the New York Public Library on 5 May 1941.</note></provenance><repository><institution>New York Public Library</institution><addressline>5th Avenue and 42nd Street</addressline><addressline>New York, New York 10018-2788</addressline><addressline>Telephone: 1 212 930 0802</addressline><addressline>URL: http://www.nypl.org/locations/schwarzman/berg-collection-english-and-american-literature</addressline><collection>Henry W. and Albert A.

While the lines drawn above line 8 and below line 10 likely indicate that this section is an addition (Blake sometimes separates additions from the rest of the text with lines and boxes elsewhere in this manuscript), Bentley's and Erdman's justification for inserting this section at this particular point in the text is unclear.  Erdman offers no explanation for his choice, but Bentley states that line 8 begins with an "X" (here transcribed as a conjectural "x"; see image below) that corresponds to "the 'X' at 'She knew them not'" (<hi rend="i">Writings</hi> volume 2, page 869n).</p><illus filename="bb196.1a.note.jpg"/><p>Blake does use corresponding "x"s elsewhere in this manuscript (sometimes within a particular object, sometimes across objects) to indicate the placement of additional text.

There is a stroke that crosses the "S" in "She". (See image below.)

The mark written in pencil (see image below) has been transcribed as a caret. <illus filename="bb196.4.27.note.jpg"/> This mark may stand as a symbol, resembling a roughly drawn "A", that corresponds with a similar mark (also written in pencil) in object 7, indicating the insertion of additional text.  However, it may be a caret corresponding to the aforementioned mark on object 7 (which, in this scenario, would also be a caret), both of which were deleted.  This would indicate that, while Blake once intended to insert additional text after the word "Rage" in line 28, he changed his mind later in the revision process.  Bentley transcribes this mark as "A" (<hi rend="i">Writings</hi> volume 2, page 872n).  This is also Rossetti's reading. (See his note written in red ink at the bottom of object 7.) Erdman apparently reads the mark as a deleted caret (page 848n).  (See the editors' note for line 28 of this object.)</note></l><l n="bb196.1.ms.04.28" justify="left">and hovering. over her.

This point of insertion is a likely one.  However, there is no clear symbol marking Blake's placement of these words.  Due to the caret after "Rage" and the mark in line 27 to which it points, Bentley (who transcribes the mark as "A") inserts lines 16 and 17 of object 7 into this line, since 7.16 begins with the same mark and these lines are, like the caret in this line and mark above it, written in pencil (<hi rend="i">Writings</hi> volume 2, page 872 and 872n).  Erdman does not insert any additional text after "Rage".  Like Bentley, he claims that the mark in line 27 corresponds with the similar mark at the beginning of 7.16.  However, he apparently reads these marks as deleted carets, and therefore states that, while lines 16 and 17 of object 7 were once intended to be inserted at this point in the text, Blake later changed his mind, inserting these lines into 7.9 instead (page 848n).  Erdman's reasoning is likely due to the fact that a line is drawn from the beginning of 7.16 to line 7.9. He ultimately places lines 16-17 and 9-14 (along with the addition found in line 8 and minus the deleted portions of lines 10-12) of object 7 into 5.20 (page 448).  Bentley notes the line drawn from 7.16 to 7.9.  However, he states that its purpose is "ambiguous", points out that it was drawn at "some indeterminate stage in the composition", and offers two different possible readings in the event that lines 16 and 17 were indeed meant to be inserted into 7.9 (Bentley, <hi rend="i">Writings</hi> volume 2, page 872n).</note></l><l n="bb196.1.ms.04.29" justify="left">while Strife Mighty Prince was bo<subst><del type="overwrite"><unclear resp="AE">o</unclear></del><add type="overwrite" place="inline">r</add></subst>n Envy in</l><l n="bb196.1.ms.04.30" justify="left">direful Pains him bore, then Envy brought forth</l><l n="bb196.1.ms.04.31" justify="left">Care.

Bentley reads the deleted portion of this line as "&amp; suspition Mixt" (<hi rend="i">Writings</hi> volume 2, page 872).  Erdman, however, reads the final word in the line as "Mist" and suggests that Blake was beginning to write "Mistrust" before making the cancellation (page 848n). <illus filename="bb196.5.19.note.jpg"/> A line drawn in pencil, extending from the end of "Emulation" to the bottom right corner of the object, indicates the addition of lines 26, 27, and 29 at this point in the text.  Erdman suggests that these lines were once intended to replace "&amp; Emulation", before being replaced themselves with text from object 7 (page 848n).  However, as "&amp; Emulation" is not cancelled, they may simply be an addition to it.

This caret is written over the period after "Conceit" (thereby deleting it) and indicates the addition of the uncancelled portion of line 19 and lines 26, 27, and 29 (which are connected to line 19 by means of a line and are also written in pencil) at this point in the text (at least at some point during composition).  Bentley reads the manuscript in this fashion and constructs his transcription accordingly (<hi rend="i">Writings</hi> volume 2, page 872).  However, in his transcription, Erdman adds the following text, pieced together from lines found on object 7 (specifically lines 16-17 and lines 9-14, along with the addition found in line 8 and minus the deleted portions of lines 10-12) after "Conceit": "and Shame bore honour &amp; made league with Pride &amp; Policy doth dwell with her by whom she [had] Mistrust &amp; Suspition.  Then bore a Daughter called Emulation. who. married. honour these follow her around the World" (page 448).  Erdman presumably inserts these lines after "Conceit" due to the fact that 7.9 begins with the same word.  (Blake indicates additions with lines or symbols in this manuscript, not entire words.  If Erdman is correct, this is an uncharacteristic choice on Blake's part.)  Obviously, inserting 7.9 after "Conceit" creates repetition, forcing Erdman to omit one instance of the word.  In order to make the lines as he has arranged them flow more smoothly, Erdman also has to insert the word "had", which does not appear in the undeleted portion of the aforementioned lines from object 7, and omit the ampersand (which may or may not be deleted in the manuscript) immediately preceding "Mistrust" in 7.9.  (For more information concerning Erdman's addition of lines 16 and 17 of object 7, see the editors' notes for 4.27 and 4.28.) Erdman does not incorporate the undeleted portion of line 19 or lines 26, 27, and 29 from this object into his transcription, stating that line 19 is the first reading for the addition following "Conceit" and that lines 26, 27, and 29 are the second and that both were "evidently" replaced by the final reading that he assembles from the additions on object 7 (page 848n). However, since these supposedly replaced portions of the text found on object 5 are not cancelled, it is difficult to determine Blake's intentions, both in terms of claiming that these additions are completely separate (as opposed to the lines at the bottom of object 5 simply being an addition to "&amp; Emulation", for example) and that certain additions found on object 7 take precedence over all of them.  Bentley states that, at least at one stage in composition, Blake probably intended to insert lines 8-14 of object 7 into this object.  He offers one possible scenario with regard to the composition of revisions, but notes that the order of Blake's revisions can now only be hypothetical.  His hypothetical scenario concludes with, in contrast to Erdman's reading, the revisions of lines 8-14 of object 7 being abandoned (although not deleted) and those in this object being allowed to stand (<hi rend="i">Writings</hi> volume 2, pages 872n and 873n).</note></l><l n="bb196.1.ms.05.21" justify="left" indent="1.5">friends <choice><orig>Joind </orig><reg>Joined</reg></choice><subst><gap reason="overwrite" extent="2" unit="character"/><add type="overwrite" place="inline">Ha</add></subst>nd in Hand, Go See. the <choice><orig>Natu-</orig><reg>Natural</reg></choice><note>Bentley reads "Joind" as "Join'd" (<hi rend="i">Writings</hi> volume 2, page 873).

The stroke which Bentley and Erdman read as a letter "i" is actually a looped stroke that is approximately the same height as the letter "l" immediately preceding it.  (This stroke is not part of the letter "l" in "lake" from line 27, the top of which is just visible.)  Furthermore, what may appear to be the dot of an "i" is in fact a punctuation mark from line 25.  While it is possible that the downstroke of a "g" could be obscured (at least partially) by the letter "k" in "lake" (line 27), a close inspection of that letter does not reveal any additional strokes or variations in line thickness that would indicate overlap. <illus filename="bb196.6.26.note.jpg"/></note></l><l n="bb196.1.ms.06.27" justify="left"><choice><orig>Oer</orig><reg>Over</reg></choice> yonder <add type="insertion" place="inline" symbol="caret"><hi rend="subscript">^</hi></add> lake. <del type="wash">while <unclear resp="AE">li</unclear></del><gap reason="cancellation" extent="4" unit="character"/><del type="wash"><unclear resp="AE">g</unclear> Clay Cold Co<unclear resp="AE">r</unclear>pse<unclear resp="AE">e</unclear> Corse</del><note>After the word "lake", Erdman inserts lines 18-19 from object 7, noting that, though these lines are not specifically marked for insertion at this point in the text, they are written on object 7 in a position that is directly opposite the deleted portion of this line and are therefore intended to replace it (page 849n).  Bentley agrees with this assertion (<hi rend="i">Writings</hi> volume 2, page 874).  The final character of the partially illegible word in this line, transcribed here as a conjectural "g", may instead be a "y".

The "x" found at the beginning of this series of lines corresponds with another (written in the same brown ink) in 4.2.  Lines 8-14 may be or may once have been intended as an addition to object 5; although the point of insertion, the relationship of these lines to other additions on that object, and any sort of possible revision order, are difficult to determine with certainty.  (See the editors' note for 5.20.)  Lines 16 and 17 may be an addition to line 28 of object 4 if one reads the mark at the beginning of line 16 as a symbol, resembling a roughly drawn "A", corresponding to another (written in pencil, as are these lines) on that object.  However, a line has been drawn between lines 16 and 9 of this object, which may also suggest that these two sections of revision were intended to be joined.  If one views the corresponding marks in 4.28 and line 16 of this object as carets acting as symbols for addition that were then deleted, this reading becomes more plausible.  However, it is difficult to determine for certain, and lines 16 and 17 have not been encoded as additions here due to that uncertainty.  (For Bentley's and Erdman's views on lines 8-17 of this object, see the editors' notes for 4.27, 4.28, and 5.20.)  Lines 18-19 may be an addition to line 27 of object 6, due to the fact that their position on this object is directly opposite deleted text in that line.  (See the editors' note for 6.27.)</p><p>Lines 1-7 are written in a different script, in a different ink (brown, as opposed to black), and with a duller pen than the script, ink, and pen used in the previous object. Lines 8-17 are written in pencil, although the strokes of lines 16 and 17 are sharper than those of 8-15. (The word that was once written in line 15 has been erased, but it appears to have been part of the penciled section immediately preceding it as opposed to the one following.) Lines 18-19 are written in light black or grey ink and in a script different from that of the other lines in this object.</p><p>The words "humility, her" and "Daughter," (along with their corresponding punctuation marks) in lines 4 and 6 are separated from the rest of the text by a roughly drawn box (or boxes) and are deleted with pencil strokes.</p><p>Marks and text in red ink (which are not reproduced in this transcription) were made by William Michael Rossetti, the first editor of the manuscript, as he readied it for publication.</p></objnote></physdesc><phystext><lg type="prose" justify="left"><l n="bb196.1.ms.07.01" justify="left" indent="28"><handShift medium="brown"/><gap reason="cancellation" extent="3" unit="character"/><note>Bentley (<hi rend="i">Writings</hi> volume 2, page 871) and Erdman (page 447) read the mark found in this line as the crossbar of a capital letter "T" (corresponding to the "t" in "take" found in line 2).
