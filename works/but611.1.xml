                The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of fully searchable and scalable electronic editions of the following works related to Blake’s development of his illustrations to Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>: Preliminary Sketches for Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, listed under Drawings and Paintings, Pencil Sketches; Preliminary Drawings for Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, listed under Drawings and Paintings, Monochrome Wash Drawings; and Preliminary Illustrations to Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, listed under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.<lb/><lb/>
                In addition, we are republishing the following works, previously presented in our Preview mode, to make their designs fully searchable: Robert Blair, <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, the 1808 book listed under Commercial Book Illustrations, Designed by Blake and Engraved by Other Engravers; <hi rend="i">Deaths Door</hi>, listed under Separate Plates and Plates in Series, Designed and Engraved by Blake; and Illustrations to Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, the series of twenty finished designs, listed under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.<lb/><lb/>
                Taken together, these works in a variety of media present a comprehensive overview of one of Blake’s major projects as an illustrator and exemplify his working methods as he developed rough sketches into finished water colors.  The evolution of any one design can be traced via links presented under Related Works in the Archive on the pull-down menus, lower left on the main viewing page for each work. <lb/><lb/>
                In October 1805, Blake was commissioned by the engraver and would-be publisher Robert H. Cromek to prepare forty drawings illustrating Robert Blair's <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, a popular "Graveyard" school poem first published in 1743.  Cromek originally planned to select twenty of these designs for a deluxe edition of the poem.  Blake launched into the project with great enthusiasm, rapidly sketching out his illustrations in pencil, developing some into wash drawings, and then producing a group of more finished water colors for presentation to Cromek.  In a first prospectus of November 1805, Cromek names Blake as both the designer and engraver of fifteen designs.  Blake etched one image, <hi rend="i">Deaths Door</hi>, in white-line, but Cromek rejected it.  The dark power of the print appeals to modern tastes, but was far from fashionable in the early nineteenth century.  In a second prospectus, also of November 1805, Cromek announced that Louis Schiavonetti would engrave twelve designs for the new edition.  Blake had lost the potentially lucrative commission to engrave his own designs; his relationship with Cromek descended into anger and argument.  In spite of their disagreement, Cromek included a portrait of Blake as a frontispiece to the volume, published in 1808.  Cromek promoted the book aggressively and the illustrations to <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> became Blake's best known work through much of the nineteenth century. <lb/><lb/>

In his 1981 catalogue of Blake's paintings and drawings, Butlin states that "the colouring and degree of finish are slightly unusual for Blake's style at this period, but the provenance of this watercolour supports its authenticity" (volume 1, page 456).  In a 2009 publication, however, Butlin states that this work "is perhaps not by Blake."  See *William Blake's Watercolour Inventions in Illustration of* The Grave *by Robert Blair*, edited with Essays and Commentary by Martin Butlin and an Essay on the Poem by Morton D. Paley (Lavenham: William Blake Trust, 2009) 30.  This work was sold in 1910 (see the note on provenance) in a lot that included works by Thomas Butts, Jr.  Perhaps he executed this work, at least in part.</role></origination><compdate value="1805">c. 1805 (?)</compdate></objdescid><objinfo><numberobj>1</numberobj><objsize>16.7 x 7.0 cm.<note>This is the size of the drawing; the full leaf is shown here.</note></objsize><numberleaves>1</numberleaves><leafsize>19.8 x 10.4 cm.</leafsize><medium>pencil, pen and ink, and water color</medium><support>wove paper</support><watermark>none recorded</watermark><pennednumbers>none</pennednumbers><framelines>none</framelines></objinfo><provenance n="1"><name>Yale Center for British Art</name><date>1975</date><dealer>John Baskett</dealer><price>£2,000</price><note>Thomas Butts, at an unknown time, probably from Blake or his wife Catherine; by inheritance in 1845 to Thomas Butts, Jr.; probably by inheritance to Captain Frederick J.

Cromek's 1808 edition of Blair's poem.  This water color is thus associated with Cromek's 1805 commission for Blake's illustrations of *The Grave*.  It was not, however, one of Blake's water-color illustrations acquired by Cromek.  The verso is inscribed, not by Blake, "From the collection of Thomas Butts the artist's friend and patron."  It is possible that the design was conceived as a descending, rather than a ascending, figure.  See the Work Information page for a discussion of the attribution of this work to Blake and/or Thomas Butts, Jr.</p></objnote><objsize>19.8 x 10.4 cm.</objsize><windowsize width="600" height="650"/></physdesc><related objectid="bb435.1.comdes.02"/><related objectid="but612.1.wd.01"/><related objectid="butwba10.1.wc.01"/><related objectid="but614r.1.penc.01"/><related objectid="bb515.1.comb.12" type="compare" copyid="bb515.1" bentley="B12"/><illusdesc><illustration type="plate" location="E"><illusobjdesc>A nude male trumpeter, perhaps a wingless angel, hovers while ascending.
