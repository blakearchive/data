            The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of 20 of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible. These designs illustrate the Old Testament and are arranged according to the passages illustrated.  They are presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).
            <lb/><lb/>
            The Bible had an enormous influence on Blake’s work as both artist and poet.  Among his many and complex responses to that text are water color drawings.  The present group of 20 is selected from a sequence of about 80 biblical water colors of similar size Blake painted for Thomas Butts between c. 1800 and 1805.  These designs emphasize interactions between the human and the divine.  In works such as <hi rend="i">Ezekiel’s Wheels</hi> and <hi rend="i">David Delivered Out of Many Waters</hi>, the interaction is revelatory or redemptive.  In other designs, including <hi rend="i">Pestilence: The Death of the First-Born</hi>, the relationship between God and humankind devolves into punishment and destruction.
            <lb/><lb/>
            This group of 20 water colors is the first installment in our publication of a large selection of Blake’s water color drawings illustrating the Bible.  In coming months we will publish a group of New Testament illustrations also from the series executed for Butts.  Later we will add early works, such as <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>, datable to c. 1780, and continue through Blake’s final biblical water colors, including <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi> of c. 1824.

At the top center sits God, an old man with long hair and a beard. He wears a gown and sits on a throne that may be made of stone. His right arm is bent upward and His fingers are spread; His left arm rests on the throne. His gesture suggests a blessing. Below God stand three male angels. In Ezekiel, these figures are called "living creatures," each with four "faces." Only two heads of the leftmost angel are visible, facing left. They may have beards. The middle angel, with large wings and three heads pictured, stands facing forward with his arms raised horizontally. He has curly hair and a flame-like beard. He is mostly nude, with the exception of wings over his shoulders and covering his genitals. His left leg is extended backward and on tiptoe; he may be walking toward the viewer. The fingers on his left hand are slightly spread. Only two bearded heads of the rightmost angel are visible. Large, dark wings extend upward from the central angel and frame the figure of God. Ezekiel's eyed wheels—a dark, swilling whirlwind—are centered on the central angel. In the outer wheel, at least eleven eyes are visible, most inset in a star-like shape. At the bottom right and left of the wheel, dark flames are visible. At the bottom center of the design, the figure of Ezekiel, a supine male, is visible. He has long hair and a beard and wears a gown. His mouth is open, perhaps in surprise. His arms are bent upward and his fingers spread as he looks up at the wheel. The sky behind the figure of God appears to be bright and clear, perhaps owing to the aura emanating from God.
