                                                  <illusobjdesc>Cloud forms appear right and left of
                                                  the heading at the top of the plate ("On Homers
                                                  Poetry," line 1). The cloud--if that is what it
                                                  is--on the left is twisted into a spiral shape.
                                                  The first vertical of "Homers" in the heading
                                                  extends into a vine, as does the descender of the
                                                  last letter of "Poetry." A wavy line, perhaps a
                                                  vine, follows line 8 of the text. The wavy lines
                                                  right of lines 22-32 might be vines, roots, or
                                                  flames. On the left side of the plate, between
                                                  lines 21 and 25 and left of lines 22-24 and the
                                                  "On Virgil" heading (line 25), we see a tree trunk
                                                  along the left margin. Standing just to the right
                                                  is a gowned and bearded male facing right. At
                                                  least his right arm is bent at the elbow and he
                                                  holds (and presumably plays) a large harp. This is
                                                  probably the bard Homer. His audience consists of
                                                  four figures to the right, all probably gowned and
                                                  standing. The left-most figured in the group,
                                                  facing left, has her or his head bowed slightly,
                                                  with the right arm bent over the chest. The next
                                                  figure to the right, facing forward, apparently
                                                  has her or his arms at the side or behind the
                                                  back. The next figure to the right, apparently
                                                  facing forward, has her or his right arm bent over
                                                  the chest. The final figure is larger and probably
                                                  male. He faces to the left with head bowed and
                                                  arms probably crossed over his chest. To the right
                                                  of this group is a tree with two branches. It is
                                                  leafless (unless we consider the words above it as
                                                  its metonymic "leaves"). To the right of this tree
                                                  and below the "On Virgil" heading is some grass or
                                                  small plants followed by a spiraling vine. The
                                                  right upper termination of the "V" of "Virgil"
                                                  also becomes a vine with a single loop. In the
                                                  space between lines 33 and 34 are, on the left,
                                                  some horizontal wavy lines that may be vines,
                                                  cloud outlines, or waves. To the right are the
                                                  vague outlines of two (female?) figures lying
                                                  horizontally, one with her head on the left and
                                                  the other (far right) with her head on the right.
                                                  At the bottom of the plate are a number of
                                                  indistinct forms that may be hovering human
                                                  figures (note particularly the figure, with arms
                                                  raised horizontally below "Gothic" in line 38). In
                                                  the lower right corner of the plate is an
                                                  indistinct form that might possibly be a human
                                                  figure with long hair, bent low to the ground (in
                                                  prayer?) with head and extended arms on the left.
                                                  This figure's legs, on the right, are drawn up and
                                                  may be covered by a gown.</illusobjdesc>
