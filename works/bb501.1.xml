                    <p>Only the heads labeled "Cancer" (second from the left in the lower row of portraits) and "Gemini" (right-most head in the lower row) are based on drawings by Blake (Butlin 692.c, 692.80) in the Small Blake-Varley Sketchbook (now dispersed).  The drawing of "Gemini" is in turn similar to Blake's Visionary Head inscribed by John Linnell "Corrinna the Grecian Poetess" (Butlin 708; see also untraced 709).  The Cancer drawing was traced by Linnell or John Varley (Butlin 751) and probably played a role in the production of this engraving.  Both drawings are very probably stylized self-portraits.  Although Blake was not born under the traditional astrological sign of Cancer, a horoscope published in 1824 specifies that his "extraordinary faculties ... are the effects of the MOON IN CANCER" (Bentley, *Records*, page 407).  Another plate (Essick LVII), not present in Varley's pamphlet but probably intended for a later installment never published, includes a version of the "Cancer" profile closer to Blake's drawing, Butlin 692.c.</p>

                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>The plate features two rows of five heads shown in profile. On the top row, the first and second figures from the left, labeled "Taurus," are both facing right. One of these figures is female with long hair tied into a bun and a slightly opened mouth, and the other figure is male with long, curly hair, a beard with long sideburns, and a slightly opened mouth. He wears a cravat and may be wearing a coat. The third and fourth figures from the left on the top row, labeled "Gemini," are facing left. One of these figures, "Capella," is male with short hair combed forward, sideburns, a closed mouth, and an aquiline nose. He is wearing a coat. The other figure, "Bellatrix," is female with long hair tied into a bun, a closed and slightly downward mouth, and an aquiline nose. She may be frowning. The fifth and final figure on the top row, "Taurus," is female and faces left. She has, long, maybe curly hair tied into a bun and a closed mouth. On the bottom row, the first and second figures from the left face right. The first of these figures, "Cochabiel," is of indeterminate sex. The figure has long hair beneath a tricorn hat, a large beak-like nose, a closed mouth, and thin, furrowed brows. The figure resembles a rooster due to the beak-like nose, drooping chin suggesting a wattle, and hat suggesting a comb or crest. To the right is a male figure, "Cancer," with long hair and a closed mouth who may be wearing a coat or cravat. His eyes are raised upward. The third, fourth, and fifth figures from the left on the bottom row all face left. The third figure, "Scorpio," is male with short hair and sideburns, a closed mouth, a aquiline nose, and a prominent chin. He wears a coat and cravat. The fourth figure, "Capella as transmitted from Taurus," is male with short hair and sideburns, a large, sloping forehead, a large, aquiline nose, and a closed mouth with large lips. The fifth figure, "Gemini," is female with long hair tied into a bun with ringlets, and a closed mouth.</illusobjdesc>

On the right is Blake's most famous Visionary Head, here labeled "The Ghost of a Flea" and shown with his mouth open.  He is also pictured in Object 3, but with his mouth closed.  Both engravings are based on Blake's drawing showing the full profile of the closed-mouth version with a detailed sketch of the creature's open mouth (Butlin 692.98).  Blake also sketched a full-length portrait of his anthropomorphic flea (Butlin 692.94) and later developed this into a tempera painting (Butlin 750).</p>

Blake's drawing of both sides of the coin is untraced (Butlin 704), as is a tracing by Linnell (reproduced in Essick, figure 113).  The separate plate of "Cancer" (see Object 1) includes the front of the coin rather than the back.  Although similar in some respects to the "Gemini" portraits in Objects 1 and 2, the "Taurus" head here in Object 3 is too distant from Blake's "Gemini" sketches to warrant the proposal of a clear Blakean origin.</p></objnote>
