    The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of thirty-three of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible.  All take their subjects from the New Testament and have been added to the twenty Old Testament subjects published in March 2010 as “Illustrations to the Bible, c. 1780-1824,” under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.  This new group is presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).
                <lb/><lb/>
                   Blake executed most of these New Testament water colors c. 1800-05 for his patron Thomas Butts.  The exceptions are <hi rend="i">The Whore of Babylon</hi> of 1809 and <hi rend="i">The Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins</hi> in the Yale Center for British Art, datable to c. 1825. The subjects range from the childhood of Jesus to his ascension, the later history of his parents and one of his major followers, St. Paul, and a group of eight designs based on the Book of Revelation.  While the illustrations of the life of Christ are fairly conventional in their subjects, in part because of the long tradition of picturing almost every event in the Gospels, individual motifs recall designs in Blake’s illuminated books and thus offer a window on Blake’s visual interpretation of the Bible. The illustrations of Revelation complement Blake’s intense engagement with apocalyptic events and images in his own poetry.
                    <lb/><lb/>
                        The selection of fifty-three biblical water colors now available in the Archive will be supplemented in the future with early works, such as <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>, datable to c. 1780, and will continue through Blake’s final biblical water colors, such as <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi>. 
                    <lb/><lb/>

In the center sits Mary, facing left and slightly forward, though with her head turned right to look at Joseph. She wears a gown, though her right breast is exposed and Jesus is suckling from it. She has long, curly hair partly covered by a veil and her arms are at her sides. Her legs are bent underneath her, as though she is kneeling. On Mary's lap sits the infant Christ, nude and with short, curly hair. He faces right and slightly up. His arms are bent upward as he holds Mary's right breast, from which he suckles. His legs are bent, with the left dangling. To the right stands Joseph, facing left and slightly forward and looking down, perhaps at Mary and Jesus. He wears a gown and a brimmed hat. He has short, curly hair and a beard. His arms are bent with his palms together as though in prayer. Far right is the trunk of a large date palm, the leafy fronds and fruit of which are visible on the right upper corner of the design. Mary sits on a grassy knoll. To the left of Joseph's lower legs grow two kinds of plants, both with flowers or buds. On the left side of the design, a donkey stands, facing right and bending down to drink from a river. Its mouth is slightly open. The river winds its way through the left side of the design into the background. Along the banks of the river or stream are several groups of leafy trees as well as several hills. Two pyramids and several fort-like buildings with walls and towers are visible in the background along the banks of the river. The sky in the background appears to be clear, and the sun over the distant hill or mountain indicates sunrise or sunset.
