                The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of fully searchable and scalable electronic editions of the following works related to Blake’s development of his illustrations to Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>: Preliminary Sketches for Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, listed under Drawings and Paintings, Pencil Sketches; Preliminary Drawings for Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, listed under Drawings and Paintings, Monochrome Wash Drawings; and Preliminary Illustrations to Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, listed under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.<lb/><lb/>
                In addition, we are republishing the following works, previously presented in our Preview mode, to make their designs fully searchable: Robert Blair, <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, the 1808 book listed under Commercial Book Illustrations, Designed by Blake and Engraved by Other Engravers; <hi rend="i">Deaths Door</hi>, listed under Separate Plates and Plates in Series, Designed and Engraved by Blake; and Illustrations to Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, the series of twenty finished designs, listed under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.<lb/><lb/>
                Taken together, these works in a variety of media present a comprehensive overview of one of Blake’s major projects as an illustrator and exemplify his working methods as he developed rough sketches into finished water colors.  The evolution of any one design can be traced via links presented under Related Works in the Archive on the pull-down menus, lower left on the main viewing page for each work. <lb/><lb/>
                In October 1805, Blake was commissioned by the engraver and would-be publisher Robert H. Cromek to prepare forty drawings illustrating Robert Blair's <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, a popular "Graveyard" school poem first published in 1743.  Cromek originally planned to select twenty of these designs for a deluxe edition of the poem.  Blake launched into the project with great enthusiasm, rapidly sketching out his illustrations in pencil, developing some into wash drawings, and then producing a group of more finished water colors for presentation to Cromek.  In a first prospectus of November 1805, Cromek names Blake as both the designer and engraver of fifteen designs.  Blake etched one image, <hi rend="i">Deaths Door</hi>, in white-line, but Cromek rejected it.  The dark power of the print appeals to modern tastes, but was far from fashionable in the early nineteenth century.  In a second prospectus, also of November 1805, Cromek announced that Louis Schiavonetti would engrave twelve designs for the new edition.  Blake had lost the potentially lucrative commission to engrave his own designs; his relationship with Cromek descended into anger and argument.  In spite of their disagreement, Cromek included a portrait of Blake as a frontispiece to the volume, published in 1808.  Cromek promoted the book aggressively and the illustrations to <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> became Blake's best known work through much of the nineteenth century. <lb/><lb/>

                        lower portion of the design. Two gravestones appear in the lower left corner
                        and at least one tomb stands in the lower right corner. A Gothic church
                        stands at the left border of the design. The roof come to a sharp point,
                        topped with a double cross. A single visible stair or step appears below the
                        door. All figures in the scene may be ghosts. At least nine figures stand or
                        walk in a procession to the right of the church. The leftmost figure stands
                        in the doorway of the church and is seen from behind. He or she may hold a
                        lit candle. A gowned male, partly bald and bending forward, stands second
                        from the left. His right leg is bent as he ascends the step at the base of
                        the church. A pair of gowned figures (possibly children) stand third and
                        fourth from the left. The child to the left faces left and holds a lit
                        candle. His or her left leg is extending backward, suggesting that he or she
                        is striding forward. The child to the right, possibly also holding a lit
                        candle, is seen from behind and faces left. A pair of gowned males with long
                        hair stand fifth and sixth from the left. The figure to the left is
                        apparently in mid-stride with one leg bent forward. His left arm is bent and
                        he holds an open book. His eyes are down; he may be reading. The head of the
                        sixth figure from the left is turned to the left; he may be looking at his
                        companion. The figure seventh from the left holds a plate or tray carrying
                        loaves of bread or other food. Only the upper body of the figure eighth from
                        the left is visible. The figure is seen partly from behind and faces left.
                        The figure ninth from the left is only visible from the shoulders up, facing
                        left or away. A leafy tree with distinct branches stands in the center of
                        the design. The full moon appears in the night sky to the left of the tree.
                        Six figures run or dance to the left and right of the tree in the center of
                        the design; they may represent ghosts. The figure farthest left is seen from
                        behind and bends or arches to the right. Second from the left, a nude
                        male(?) is seen from behind. He strides to the left with his left leg bent
                        and right leg extended back to the right. The figure's arms are raised
                        nearly horizontally with the palms held vertically and out away from his
                        body. The figure third from the left strides to the right with his or her
                        right leg bent. A nude male appears fourth from the left. He runs to the
                        left with his left leg extended backward nearly horizontally. Both arms are
                        held horizontally, palms vertical. A nude figure appears fifth from the
                        left. The figure runs forward and to the left with his or her arms crossed
                        and right leg extended backward and left foot on tiptoe. His or her head is
                        down. A sketchy figure that may face right stands farthest right.
                        Twenty-five figures appear near the borders or corners of the design. The
                        upper bodies of two nude figures appear in the lower left portion of the
                        design; the figures are partially buried in the earth. The figure to the
                        left may be female. She faces right with her head bent back. Her arms are
                        bent upward, with her hands curled into fists. The figure to the right is
                        male and has short hair. He faces forward with his head turned to the left;
                        his mouth is open and he may look toward the figure to the left. The
                        figure's arms are bent upward with his hands curled into fists. Two figures
                        lie on the ground at the lower border of the design. The lower figure,
                        likely male and nude, lies horizontally, facing away. His arms are raised
                        vertically relative to his body and may be grasping the tombstone to the
                        left. His right leg is bent and drawn up and his left leg is extended up and
                        to the right; another ghost holds and likely pulls him by the ankle. The
                        lower figure may be a nude female with long hair, lying supine. Her right
                        arm is at her side and may be grasping at the leg of the figure above and to
                        the right of her. She may be pulling the ghost to her right. A nude, bald
                        male hovers or flies in the lower right portion of the design. Both arms are
                        extended down and to the left; he grasps and may pull the ankle of the ghost
                        below with both hands. His mouth is open (he may be howling) and he looks up
                        and to the left, though his body faces right. An open book rests on the
                        ground to the right of a tombstone along the lower border of the design. A
                        bishop's crozier (a staff with a coiled terminal) appears to the right. A
                        nude male(?) figure sits, facing left, on a tomb in the lower right corner
                        of the design. He is hunched forward slightly. His left leg is bent and
                        raised slightly, as though in the process of stomping. A nude, bald male
                        crouches on a tomb in the lower right corner of the design. Both arms are
                        down and he holds and pulls the hair of the buried figure below. He faces
                        forward and looks down and to the left, with his left foot on tiptoe. The
                        figure below is visible from the eyes up. Three heads in the lower right
                        corner of the design, visible from the shoulders up, face forward and look
                        up, with mouths open, perhaps howling. In the lower right portion of the
                        design two nude figures recline. The left figure of the pair faces forward,
                        legs extended to the left. Its left arm is at its side, but bent as though
                        bracing its body on the left elbow. Its right arm is raised vertically and
                        bent over its head. It may hold a stick or axe in its right hand. The
                        rightmost reclining figure faces away, legs extended to the left. Its right
                        arm may be at its side. A gowned figure hovers along the right margin of the
                        design, facing right and down. Its right arm is extended vertically relative
                        to its body, as though reaching downward. To the right of the figures
                        dancing around the tree hover three nude figures. The bottommost figure of
                        the group is upside down, facing slightly left with his(?) head bent back
                        and mouth open. His legs are bent, as though braced. His arms are reaching
                        downward, relative to his body, holding onto the head of the figure above
                        him. The middle figure of the group is supine, upside down. His(?) arms are
                        raised above his head and his legs are extended up slightly. The topmost
                        figure of the group faces forward with its legs extended down; with both
                        arms, he holds onto the feet or legs of the figure below him. To the right
                        of the tree branches hover three figures. The leftmost and rightmost figures
                        appear to be children, facing forward and perhaps gowned. The central figure
                        may be gowned and faces forward, looking slightly down to the left; with
                        both hands, he or she holds onto the children on either side. A group of at
                        least six figures hovers or flies above the tree in the center of the
                        design. The leftmost figure of this group faces left and hunches forward
                        slightly, legs bent and drawn up. The middle three figures face right and
                        may be gowned. The figure second from the right may face right and up, legs
                        extended backward and to the right. The rightmost figure may be sitting,
                        facing forward. Its legs may be bent but extended to the right. Some clouds
                        may be visible in the sky among the group of figures hovering across the top
                        of the design. Two figures hover or fly in front of the church spire. The
                        uppermost figure's body is horizontal, facing left and down. Its legs are
                        bent slightly and extended backward. Its arms may be at its side. The figure
                        on the bottom of the pair faces forward and slightly left. Its legs are bent
                        and extended backward, with its left arm raised horizontally and its right
                        arm bent upward over its head. It may be gowned and may hold something in
                        each hand. </illusobjdesc><component type="object" location="CD"><characteristic>graveyard</characteristic><characteristic>tomb</characteristic><characteristic>tombstone</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The scene takes place in a graveyard that stretches across the
