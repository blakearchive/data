                The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of fully searchable and scalable electronic editions of the following works related to Blake’s development of his illustrations to Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>: Preliminary Sketches for Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, listed under Drawings and Paintings, Pencil Sketches; Preliminary Drawings for Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, listed under Drawings and Paintings, Monochrome Wash Drawings; and Preliminary Illustrations to Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, listed under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.<lb/><lb/>
                In addition, we are republishing the following works, previously presented in our Preview mode, to make their designs fully searchable: Robert Blair, <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, the 1808 book listed under Commercial Book Illustrations, Designed by Blake and Engraved by Other Engravers; <hi rend="i">Deaths Door</hi>, listed under Separate Plates and Plates in Series, Designed and Engraved by Blake; and Illustrations to Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, the series of twenty finished designs, listed under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.<lb/><lb/>
                Taken together, these works in a variety of media present a comprehensive overview of one of Blake’s major projects as an illustrator and exemplify his working methods as he developed rough sketches into finished water colors.  The evolution of any one design can be traced via links presented under Related Works in the Archive on the pull-down menus, lower left on the main viewing page for each work. <lb/><lb/>
                In October 1805, Blake was commissioned by the engraver and would-be publisher Robert H. Cromek to prepare forty drawings illustrating Robert Blair's <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, a popular "Graveyard" school poem first published in 1743.  Cromek originally planned to select twenty of these designs for a deluxe edition of the poem.  Blake launched into the project with great enthusiasm, rapidly sketching out his illustrations in pencil, developing some into wash drawings, and then producing a group of more finished water colors for presentation to Cromek.  In a first prospectus of November 1805, Cromek names Blake as both the designer and engraver of fifteen designs.  Blake etched one image, <hi rend="i">Deaths Door</hi>, in white-line, but Cromek rejected it.  The dark power of the print appeals to modern tastes, but was far from fashionable in the early nineteenth century.  In a second prospectus, also of November 1805, Cromek announced that Louis Schiavonetti would engrave twelve designs for the new edition.  Blake had lost the potentially lucrative commission to engrave his own designs; his relationship with Cromek descended into anger and argument.  In spite of their disagreement, Cromek included a portrait of Blake as a frontispiece to the volume, published in 1808.  Cromek promoted the book aggressively and the illustrations to <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> became Blake's best known work through much of the nineteenth century. <lb/><lb/>

                        stone stairs and marked by four alcoves. At the top of the stairs stands a
                        winged, gowned female angel. She may personify Hope. She carries an (oil?)
                        lamp, from which beams of light emanate. She faces forward but turns to look
                        left. Her long hair is pulled up into a bun and her left arm is at her side,
                        palm down. Her right arm is raised at 135 degrees and she holds the lamp in
                        her right hand. Both her feet are on tiptoe, and her right leg is bent and
                        extended backward slightly as she descends the stairs. Ten figures descend
                        the central stone stairs below the angel; these may be spirits of the
                        deceased. The topmost figure is a gowned female with long hair, facing
                        right. Her right leg is bent and extended backward on tiptoe and she hunches
                        slightly forward. Her arms are at her side but bent to hold a child, likely
                        her own. The second figure from the top is a child, perhaps an infant, that
                        sits in its mother's arms. He(?) appears to be nude with short hair. His
                        legs are bent and drawn up. The third figure from the top is a male dressed
                        in a loincloth, facing forward and looking left. He has short, curly hair.
                        His arms are at his sides but bent slightly, palms down. Both of his legs
                        are bent, with the left leg extended backward and on tiptoe. The fourth
                        figure from the top is an old, gowned male with long hair and a beard. He
                        appears to enter an alcove, which may lead farther downward into another
                        section of the cave. He faces left and away, with his left arm at his side,
                        palm downward. His left leg is extended backward and on tiptoe, with his
                        left foot visible beneath the hem of his gown. The fifth and sixth figures
                        from the top are two gowned children. The leftmost of the pair is a boy with
                        short, curly hair, who faces forward and left but looks up and to the right,
                        perhaps at the child to the right. His legs are slightly bent and his right
                        foot is visible beneath the hem of his gown. His arms are at his side but
                        bent to hold the hand of the figure to either side. The rightmost child of
                        this pair is a girl with long hair. Her head is down with her left hand on
                        her face. She may be crying. Her arms are at her side, with her left arm
                        bent upward and her right hand holding the hand of the boy to the left. Her
                        left leg is bent slightly and on tiptoe. The seventh figure from the top is
                        a gowned woman with long, curly hair. She is likely the mother of the three
                        children who stand around her. She faces forward and left, but looks up and
                        to the right. Her mouth may be slightly open. Her right leg is extended
                        backward slightly and on tiptoe. Her arms are at her side and she holds the
                        hands of the children to either side. The eighth figure from the top is a
                        gowned child of indeterminable gender, with long, curly hair. The child
                        faces left and forward but looks up and to the right, probably at its
                        mother. Its left foot is visible beneath the hem of its gown and its arms
                        are at its side, its left hand holding that of the woman to the right. The
                        ninth and tenth figures from the top are a pair of gowned, old figures with
                        long hair. The leftmost figure is a male with a long beard. He faces right
                        and down slightly, looking at the figures to the right. His left leg is bent
                        backward slightly on tiptoe. His right arm is at his side but bent and he
                        holds onto a walking stick or cane with his right hand. The rightmost figure
                        is a woman who faces right and hunches over slightly, looking down and to
                        the right. Her left leg is bent and her arms are at her sides but bent
                        upward, palms vertical, in a gesture of surprise. In the top right alcove in
                        the central cave, four figures are visible. Two figures, which may represent
                        dead bodies or stone tomb effigies, lie supine on a slab of stone or marble,
                        which is marked with carvings of Gothic arches. The topmost figure faces
                        forward slightly. The bottommost figure faces up and may have long hair, its
                        left arm at its side. Both figures are gowned. To the right of the tomb are
                        two gowned figures, facing right and only visible as upper bodies. The
                        leftmost figure of the pair is an old man with a bald crown but long hair
                        and a beard. His arms are at his side but bent upward so that his hands are
                        clasped, as though in prayer. The rightmost figure is a woman with long
                        hair. Her mouth may be slightly open and she bends forward. Her arms are at
                        her side but bent upward with her hands together as though praying. Two
                        gowned figures lie in the bottom right alcove of the central cave on a
                        partly rolled woven mat. The topmost figure of the pair is a male with
                        short, curly hair. His lower body faces up but he twists at the waist so
                        that his upper body faces forward. He looks down and to the right at the
                        face of the figure below him. His right arm is at his side but bent upward,
                        palm raised. His left arm curves around the head of the woman next to him,
                        cradling it. The bottommost figure of the pair is a female whose long hair
                        may be pulled back into a bun. She faces up, with her head bent back. Her
                        mouth is open and her eyes are closed, suggesting that she may be sleeping,
                        fainting, or dying. Her left arm is at her side and is resting on the
                        ground, palm up. In the bottom left alcove of the central cave are four
                        gowned figures. Toward the back of the alcove, an old male figure with long
                        hair and a beard lies supine, eyes closed. He faces up and right. He may be
                        dead or sleeping. He lies on a pillow cushion atop a stone slab carved with
                        arches on the side. Two figures kneel in front of the tomb. The leftmost
                        figure is of indeterminable gender, with long hair covering its face. It
                        faces left and bends forward, head down. The figure sits on a step, legs
                        bent. Its left arm is bent upward, resting on its left leg, with its left
                        hand on its face. The rightmost figure of the pair is a female with long,
                        curly hair. She faces away and to the left, bending forward slightly. She
                        may look at the figure to the right. The rightmost of the four figures is a
                        male with short, curly hair. He faces away, with his lower body facing left
                        and his upper body twisted to face right. He looks to the right as well. His
                        arms are at his side but bent upward, palms up. His left leg is bent
                        backward and on tiptoe as he steps down from a stair into the alcove. The
                        curved top of the central cave frames a scene at the top of the image,
                        including four hills or mountaintops and a clear sky. At the top left corner
                        of the design stands a house with a thatched roof and the frontmost wall
                        missing. Along the back wall stands an open, arched doorway. Two figures are
                        visible inside the house. The leftmost figure is a gowned male with short,
                        curly hair, lying supine on a pillow and woven mat. His right arm is resting
                        at his side and his eyes are closed, suggesting that he is dead. Above him
                        is a gowned female with long curly hair. She kneels(?), facing left and
                        slightly forward. She bends down, looking at the figure to the left. Her
                        arms are raised at 135 degrees, palms vertical and her mouth is open in a
                        gesture of surprise and perhaps mourning. To the right of the house hovers
                        or flies a nude male figure with curly hair, seen from behind. This may
                        represent the soul of the man in the house to the left. His body faces right
                        but his head turns to look left. His legs are together but bent and extended
                        backward. His arms are raised at 45 degrees, palms down. The hill or
                        mountaintop second from the left has a cave visible in the front and ten
                        figures climbing it. Two gowned figures facing right and ascending the
                        mountain stand on the left side of the mountaintop. The leftmost of the two
                        figures may be bald and has its right arm at its side. The rightmost of
                        these two figures may be a male with short hair. His right leg is extended
                        backward and his right arm is raised horizontally, holding a walking stick
                        with his right hand. The five(?) figures walking or standing on the top of
                        the mountain face right; all appear to be gowned. The figures second, third,
                        and fifth from the left have their right arms bent. The figure second from
                        the left may have long hair but all others appear to be bald. The three
                        figures descending the right side of the mountain may be gowned and face
                        right. A figure, visible only from the neck up, stands in front of the cave
                        in the center of the mountain, facing away. At least seven figures descend
                        the rightmost hill or mountaintop. The topmost figure is visible as a
                        sketchy upper body, facing forward and perhaps slightly right. The second
                        figure from the top is visible as a sketchy head and upper body, facing
                        forward and perhaps slightly right. The third figure from the top is visible
                        as a sketchy head and upper body, facing forward and to the left, and
                        perhaps bending forward slightly. The fourth figure from the top appears to
                        be a nude male, facing forward and left and looking down. Both arms are at
                        his side, with his left palm down and his right hand holding a walking
                        stick. His left leg is bent and extended backward. He may have short hair.
                        The fifth figure from the top is gowned and perhaps bald, facing forward and
                        slightly left. Its left leg is bent and extended backward slightly. Its arms
                        are bent to hold what appears to be an infant. The sixth figure from the top
                        appears to be an infant, facing forward and right. It may be swaddled in
                        cloth. The bottommost figure of this group appears to be a gowned male with
                        a bald crown but possibly short hair below that. His arms are at his side
                        with his right arm bent slightly and his right hand holding a walking stick;
                        his left hand may hold an indistinguishable object, or his palm may be
                        horizontal, facing down. His left leg is bent and extended backward
                        slightly. His body faces left and forward, but he looks to the right,
                        perhaps at the figures behind him. The third hill or mountaintop from the
                        left, right of the house has a small cave in its front. Two figures are
                        visible in front the cave from the shoulders up. Both face away and appear
                        to be gowned and have short hair. They may be descending into the cave. </illusobjdesc><component type="object" location="E"><characteristic>cave</characteristic><characteristic>stone</characteristic><characteristic>stairs</characteristic><characteristic>step</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Most of the design shows an elaborate cave, bisected by a set
