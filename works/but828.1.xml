            <updatestmt>
                The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of the <hi rend="i">Genesis</hi> manuscript from the Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens.<lb/>
                <lb/>
                    In the last year of his life, Blake began an illuminated manuscript of the biblical Book of Genesis for his patron, John Linnell.  Of its eleven large leaves, probably cut from Whatman Imperial-sized wove paper, the first two are title pages.  The text on leaves 3-11 closely follows chapters 1-4 of the King James Bible, decorated with sketched headpieces, tailpieces, and interlinear designs, with chapter headings of Blake’s own invention that align the biblical creation narrative with his myth of creation, division, and forgiveness.  His insertion of “adamah” after most appearances of “ground” in the English text shows Blake’s (and his patron’s) engagement with the original Hebrew, underscores Blake’s view that the creation of the first man was a descent into materiality, and suggests that Adam was originally androgynous because “adamah” is a feminine noun.<lb/>
                <lb/>
                Like the title pages of a number of Blake’s early illuminated books, his lettering of the <hi rend="i">Genesis</hi> titles is closely integrated with the illustrations. The reason for variant title pages is not clear, though perhaps Linnell responded unfavorably to the first version (our object 1) and requested the more elegant second version.  The main text was composed in six stages, beginning with horizontal lines to guide the lettering.  Then Blake drafted the biblical text in light pencil—in a style that mimics the gothic lettering of medieval illuminated manuscripts—and composed the chapter headings.  In subsequent stages he overwrote his earlier work in darker pencil, red and green ink, and occasional gold leaf. Thus Blake revised his preliminary intentions with forms evolving on the same matrix. <lb/>
                <lb/>
                Blake’s use of headpiece and tailpiece pairings to denote chapter divisions conforms to eighteenth-century conventions for illustrated books and follows the format of his early illuminated books, such as <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> (1789) and <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> (1793). Taken together, the headpieces and chapter headings provide visual and verbal introductions to each chapter that signal Blake’s reinterpretations of the narrative.<lb/>
                <lb/>
                The unfinished state of the <hi rend="i">Genesis</hi> designs offers insights into Blake’s method of graphic composition. There is no obvious sequence to the development of the designs. Those on leaves 3–5 have some coloring, including green, over the initial pencil sketches, suggesting that Blake added washes as he overwrote the penciled text in green. The designs on leaves 6–11 are noticeably rougher and uncolored, like the texts on these leaves. Blake clearly did not finish designs before moving on to start others, probably intending to return later to develop his preliminary drawings. The compositional process was evidently non-linear, spontaneous, and rapid.<lb/>
                <lb/>
                The manuscript, left unfinished at Blake’s death in August 1827, leaves off with his interpretation of the story of Cain as an exemplary tale of forgiveness, a major theme in his later writings.<lb/>

                  are lightly sketched wings. The light wavy pencil lines either side of the wings
                  may depict the firmament or heaven. The figure below and to the left of the Holy
                  Ghost, and next to the "N" of the title, faces forward and is kneeling in a
                  sphere. This figure is male and wears a tight fitting garment. The figure has
                  long, wild hair and a pointed chin or possibly a short beard. This is Christ, God
                  the Son. His left arm extends horizontally to the right, over the top of the "N,"
                  and his left hand, palm downward, may be touching the raised right hand of the
                  figure below. God the Son's right arm is bent slightly at the elbow and partially
                  rests on his left thigh. His left leg is bent at the knee and his left foot is
                  visible. God the Son kneels on his right knee and he may be looking right,
                  although his eyes are only slits. The figure to the right of God the Son occupies
                  a mandorla and is male with long, wild hair and a long beard. This is God the
                  Father. He faces forward and is wearing a long flowing robe. His right arm is
                  raised vertically and is bent slightly at the elbow. His right hand is palm up and
                  his left arm is at his side. His left knee may be bent slightly and the pencil and
                  ink lines below the robe suggest feet. The wavy pencil and water color lines above
                  and below the mandorla may represent water. The positioning of God the Father's
                  arms, his right arm counterbalancing his left, suggests that he is dividing the
                  waters under the firmament (or sky) from the waters above the firmament as
                  described in Genesis 1:7. In the lower center of the design is a standing nude,
                  male figure with curly hair, facing forward. This is Adam. His head and upper
                  torso are surrounded by a large halo. A few lines emanating from the halo suggest
                  that it may also be a radiant sun behind Adam. Adam extends both arms, his right
                  arm is raised vertically and in his right hand he may be touching the left hand of
                  the figure above and to the left. Adam's head is tilted back and to the left
                  slightly. He appears to be looking up. Adam's left arm is raised horizontally at
                  135 degrees. His legs are bent slightly at the knee and he is standing on a convex
                  arc that represents the surface of the Earth. The letter "I" in the title covers
                  his loins, almost like a loincloth. Beneath Adam, four possibly nude creatures are
                  pictured with flames above their heads. They may be sitting or kneeling in water,
                  as indicated by a few serpentine splashes of blue wash, or on the Earth, as the
                  green patches of coloring might suggest. These figures have distinct humanoid
                  features. The leftmost figure faces forward and both arms are raised vertically.
                  The fingers on the right hand are spread and its head is tilted back slightly.
                  This creature's legs appear to be bent and it is possibly kneeling. The second
                  figure from the left faces forward and appears to have its arms bent across the
                  chest, with hand in an attitude of supplication or possibly surprise. The second
                  figure from the right faces forward,with the head facing left, and its right arm
                  is raised vertically. The fingers of its right hand appear to be spread. Its left
                  arm is by its side and may be supporting the creature. The left leg appears to be
                  bent at the knee. The rightmost figure faces forward and to the left. Its right
                  arm is raised vertically and the fingers of its right hand are spread. This
                  creature's eyes are open and it looks up and to the left. Wavy pencil lines below
                  these four creatures probably represent water. Light wavy pencil lines either side
                  of these creatures may represent smoke or clouds.</illusobjdesc>

                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>The design is compositionally arranged around the title letters and
                  eight human, or at least semi-human figures. The division of the title into three
                  lines may be an allusion to the Trinity, also depicted visually. At the top of the
                  design is a nude, male striding figure, with prominent buttocks and extended arms,
                  raised horizontally, moving left to right. The figure is seen from behind and his
                  head appears to face right. This is the Holy Ghost. Either side of the Holy Ghost
                  are lightly sketched wings. The light wavy pencil lines either side of the wings
                  may depict the firmament (or heaven). The figure below and to the left of the Holy
                  Ghost, and next to the "N" of the title, faces forward in a cruciform pose. This
                  figure is male and wears a flowing diaphanous robe. The figure has long hair and a
                  short beard. This is Christ, God the Son. His head face right and he may be
                  looking. Both arms are raised horizontally, palms down. In his left hand, God the
                  Son holds the end of a scroll. His right leg is bent slightly at the knee and his
                  right foot is on tip toe. He may be hovering. The figure to the right of God the
                  Son occupies a mandorla and is male with long hair and a long beard. This is God
                  the Father. He faces forward and is wearing a long flowing robe. His right arm is
                  raised vertically. His right hand is palm up and his left arm is at his side. His
                  left knee may be bent slightly. The wavy pencil and water color lines above and
                  below the mandorla may represent water. The positioning of God the Father's arms,
                  his right arm counterbalancing his left, suggests that he is dividing the waters
                  under the firmament (sky) from the waters above the firmament as described in
                  Genesis 1:7. In the central area between the upper two lines of the title letters,
                  "G E / N E," are two palm trees. The title letters are decorated with flowering
                  vegetation. The upper arm of the "G" incorporates a large green leaf. Three
                  funnel-shaped forms, possibly seed pods of the lotus, dangle from the lower
                  horizontal arm of the "G." The right vertical of the "G" is formed like a sheaf of
                  grain with grain tassels upper left. The "E" contains three blooming roses and
                  possibly blades of grass or grain. The "N" contains a serpentine stem that
                  terminates in a five- or six-petal bloom, perhaps a lotus flower. The second "E"
                  includes serpentine tendrils and a star-shaped blossom, possibly the lily of
                  Calvary. The final three letters, "S I S," are devoid of flowers. Both letters "S"
                  are composed of sheafs or shafts of grain or grass. The first "S" also contains
                  three ovoid shapes on the upper left. The "I" is depicted as a classical pillar
                  with a curving, circular flourish at the top left. In the lower center of the
                  design is a standing nude, male figure with curly hair, facing forward. This is
                  Adam. His head and upper torso are surrounded by a large halo. Lines emanating
                  from the halo suggest that it may also be a radiant sun behind Adam. Adam extends
                  both arms; his right arm is raised vertically and in his right hand he holds the
                  same scroll held by God the Son. Adam's head faces to the left slightly. Adam's
                  left arm is raised horizontally, bent at the elbow, and his left hand is palm up.
                  His legs are bent slightly at the knee, with his left foot on tiptoe. He is
                  standing on a convex arc that represents the surface of the Earth. Beneath Adam
                  are four possibly nude creatures. They may be sitting or kneeling in water, as
                  indicated by the wavy pencil lines a black washes below them. These figures have
                  distinct humanoid features. The body of the leftmost figure faces forward and his
                  head faces right in profile. The creature is wearing a crown and a flame-like
                  tongue flicks out of its open mouth. It is looking upward and to the right. Its
                  left arm is raised vertically and is bent at the elbow. This arm is covered is
                  scales. The left hand is palm up. The creature's right breast is covered in
                  scales. Its right arms extands downward and the right palm faces downward. The
                  creature is sitting and the right arm appears to be supporting its upper body. The
                  creature's legs are together and are bent. The body of the second figure from the
                  left faces forward and its head faces right. It has a bird-like head with curved
                  beak and large oval eye looking up and right. It is wearing a crown and its left
                  arm is bent across the chest. Its right arm is by its side and may be bent at the
                  elbow(?). The creature's legs are together and are drawn up in a sitting position.
                  The body of second figure from the right faces forward and to the right. The
                  creature's head face forward and slightly to the left. The figure has short curly
                  hair or fur on its head, shoulders and neck. This figure's head suggests a lion.
                  Its eyes and mouth are open and his tongue is visible. The creature's arms are
                  across its chest and its hands are in a position of prayer or supplication. Its
                  legs are together and are drawn up in a sitting posture. The body of the rightmost
                  figure faces forward and to the right while the head faces forward and to the
                  left. This creature has a cow- or ox-like head with two curved horns, two open
                  eyes and large nostrils. This creature is looking to the left. The creature's arms
                  are across its chest and its hands are raised, palms vertical, in a gesture that
                  suggests surprise. Its legs are together and are drawn up in a sitting posture.
                  Wavy pencil lines below these four creatures probably represent water. Behind the
                  rightmost and leftmost creatures are two fruit-bearing trees with thick trunks and
                  leafy branches. The tree on the left of the design bears ovoid-shaped fruit while
                  the tree on the right of the design bears grape-like clusters of fruits. These
                  trees represent the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil and the Tree of
                  Life.</illusobjdesc>

                     raised vertically and in his right hand he holds the same scroll held by God
                     the Son. Adam's head faces to the left slightly. Adam's left arm is raised
                     horizontally, bent at the elbow, and his left hand is palm up. His legs are
                     bent slightly at the knee, with his left foot on tip toe. He is standing on a
                     convex arc that represents the surface of the earth. The "I" of the title
                     covers his loins, almost like a loincloth.</illusobjdesc>

                    <p>This object contains red and green ink as well as pencil markings. Crosby and
                  Essick note that the "partly erased" pencil writing visible around the chapter
                  heading suggests that Blake initially wrote Genesis verses 1-2 higher on the page
                  than in his later writing (page 7n). Crosby and Essick call attention to
                  underwriting such as this in the manuscript but do not transcribe it (page 1);
                  they use textual notes to detail many individual occurrences. In this
                  transcription, legible underwriting has been transcribed when it differs
                  significantly from Blake's later writing in content or position. When the
                  underwritten text is identical but appears in a different location, gray font has
                  been used to distinguish underwriting from other text. Please note that gray font
                  is also used in Blake Archive transcriptions to describe unclear or conjectural
                  text. </p>

                    <illusobjdesc>This design depicts a bearded deity in the act of creation. In the
                  center of the design is a male, possibly nude, facing forward, with long beard and
                  hair. This is God the Father in the act of creation. With his left hand, this
                  figure points downward. His right arm is bent upward and the right palm faces
                  outward in a gesture of benediction. Either side of this central figure are the
                  heads and upper bodies of two, possibly male, attendants with curly hair. The
                  figure on the right has its left arm raised between the horizontal and 135 degrees
                  with the left palm upward. This figure appears to be looking down. The attendant
                  figure on the left is looking downward. Its right arm is raised horizontally at
                  135 degrees with the left palm upward. Two large wings extend from both attendant
                  figures suggesting that they are angels. Loose pencil strokes immediately below
                  and either side of these figures could represent clouds. The scene probably takes
                  place in heaven.</illusobjdesc>

                  overwritten at a later stage. Crosby and Essick call attention to this
                  underwriting but do not transcribe it (page 1); they use textual notes to detail
                  many individual occurrences. In this transcription, legible underwriting has been
                  transcribed when it differs significantly from Blake's later writing in content or
                  position. When the underwritten text is identical but appears in a different
                  location, gray font has been used to distinguish underwriting from other text.
                  Please note that gray font is also used in Blake Archive transcriptions to
                  describe unclear or conjectural text. Ruled lines, drawn in pencil, are visible in
                  lines 9-14 of this object.</p>

                    <illusobjdesc>The three major designs on this leaf appear to be compositionally
                  related, with each panel representing an aspect of creation. At the top of the
                  leaf are three winged, possibly male, figures. Above these figures are four
                  six-pointed stars. Between the three figures are two circle shapes, possibly
                  representing the sun and the moon. The leftmost figure faces to the right, in
                  profile, and has long hair. He is wearing a long flowing robe or gown and his arms
                  are raised at 45 degrees. The central figure faces away and his arms are raised at
                  135 degrees. His left leg is bent and his left is on tiptoe. The rightmost figure
                  faces forward, has long, wild hair and a pointed chin. His arms are raised at 45
                  degrees. He is wearing a long diaphanous robe or gown and his left leg may be
                  slightly bent. Wavy lines beneath these figures could represent waters. A very
                  light convex arc, representing the surface of the Earth, appears behind and on
                  either side of the central figure.</illusobjdesc>

                    <p>This object contains red and green ink as well as a number of light pencil
                  markings, some of which are legible. These appear to be remnants of Blake's first
                  writing that were erased or overwritten at a later stage. Crosby and Essick call
                  attention to this underwriting but do not transcribe it (page 1); they use textual
                  notes to detail many individual occurrences. Beginning in verse 27, the text in
                  green ink is often in a slightly different position than the pencil writing
                  beneath it (Crosby and Essick page 7n). In this transcription, legible
                  underwriting has been transcribed when it differs significantly from Blake's later
                  writing in content or position. When the underwritten text is identical but
                  appears in a different location, gray font has been used to distinguish
                  underwriting from other text. Please note that gray font is also used in Blake
                  Archive transcriptions to describe unclear or conjectural text. Some of the ruled
                  lines, drawn in pencil, in this object are double, fragmented, or partially
                  erased. In some cases the ruled lines bisect or lie above the text. </p>

                    <illusobjdesc>This design depicts four standing male figures in dynamic attitudes.
                  The nude figure on the left has short hair and is facing right in profile. This
                  may be Adam. His arms are raised horizontally and bent upward with fingers spread
                  and palms up. This figure's left leg extends back and is bent slightly at the
                  knee. His left foot is on tiptoe. On the right of the design are three gowned
                  figures in similar poses. All three face forward and left, and their arms are
                  raised. Their left arms are raised at 135 degrees and their right arms are raised
                  at 45 degrees, with palms up. The rightmost figure may have short hair. The
                  central figure has long hair and a beard. This may be God the Father. The leftmost
                  figure of this tripartite grouping, possibly the Trinity, may also have long hair.
                  All three figures may be holding objects in their raised left hands. Swirling
                  pencil lines either side of the four figures may represent clouds. The pencil
                  lines beneath the figures may represent the ground. </illusobjdesc>

                     continues on the next line. They indicate that the erased text reads, "after

                     (page 7n). The King James Bible reads "creepeth upon the earth after his kind:
                     and God saw that it was good" (Crosby and Essick page 11).</note>

                    <p>The use of green ink in the manuscript stops midway through the first line of
                  verse 5 in this object; from this point forward Blake's text is written only in
                  pencil. The chapter headings and Blake's title are also written in pencil. In
                  addition to dark text in pencil, which has been transcribed here in black font,
                  this object contains a number of light pencil markings, some of which are legible.
                  These appear to be remnants of Blake's first writing that were erased or
                  overwritten at a later stage. Crosby and Essick call attention to this
                  underwriting but do not transcribe it (page 1); they use textual notes to detail
                  many individual occurrences. In this transcription, legible underwriting has been
                  transcribed when it differs significantly from Blake's later writing in content or
                  position. When the underwritten text is identical but appears in a different
                  location, gray font has been used to distinguish underwriting from other text.
                  Please note that gray font is also used in Blake Archive transcriptions to
                  describe unclear or conjectural text. Some of the ruled lines, drawn in pencil, in
                  this object are double, fragmented, or partially erased. In some cases the ruled
                  lines bisect or lie above the text. </p>

                    <illusobjdesc>This design depicts the creation of Adam and Eve. In the center of the
                  design is a nude male, facing forward with arms bent upward with palms up. This is
                  Adam. His head tilts back and to the right slightly. His eyes may be open. Adam's
                  legs are drawn up and he appears to be half sitting and half reclining on a convex
                  arc. Above Adam is a large, possibly male, figure facing forward. Dark pencil
                  lines extending from this figure to the right suggest a beard. This could be God
                  the Father. The figure on the left of the design may be male, faces forward with
                  the head facing left and up. Curved lines left and right of his body indicate
                  wings. The figure's mouth is open and he may be wearing a crown. The figure's legs
                  and arms are bent and he is in a contracted pose. The figure on the right of the
                  design is a nude female, facing forward and to the left. This is Eve. She has long
                  hair; her eyes and mouth may be open. Her arms are bent across her chest, possibly
                  covering her breasts. Her legs extend diagonally to left and appear to touch
                  Adam's left hip or thigh. Above these figures are looping and swirling pencil
                  lines that may represent branches of a tree. Ovoid shapes above the figure on the
                  left may be fruit. Pencil lines either side of the figures may represent tree
                  trunks. Below the figures is a convex arc representing the surface of the Earth. </illusobjdesc>

                     rather than "all his works" (Crosby and Essick page 11). The mark that overlaps
                     with the lower part of "e" in "made" may be be a "misplaced period"; in the
                     King James Bible there is a period after "made" (Crosby and Essick page

                    <p>This object contains a number of light pencil markings, some of which are legible.
                  These appear to be remnants of Blake's first writing that were erased or
                  overwritten at a later stage. Crosby and Essick call attention to this
                  underwriting but do not transcribe it (page 1); they use textual notes to detail
                  many individual occurrences. They note that underwriting is visible through verse
                  21 of this object and that in verses 14 through 17, the underwritten text is in a
                  different position than the text darker text written over it (page 8n). In this
                  transcription, legible underwriting has been transcribed when it differs
                  significantly from Blake's later writing in content or position. When the
                  underwritten text is identical but appears in a different location, gray font has
                  been used to distinguish underwriting from other text. Please note that gray font
                  is also used in Blake Archive transcriptions to describe unclear or conjectural
                  text. Some of the ruled lines, drawn in pencil, in this object are double,
                  fragmented, or partially erased. In some cases the ruled lines bisect or lie above
                  the text. </p>

                    <illusobjdesc>This design illustrates Eve's creation and contains five figures. There
                  are three figures at the top of the design in a recessional grouping. These
                  figures are soaring left to right. The front figure is male, has long hair and
                  possibly a beard. He is wearing a long gown. His eye is open and he is looking to
                  the right. His arms are at his sides and the fingers of both hands are spread
                  slightly. Only the heads of the second and third figures in this tripartite
                  grouping are visible. They face right. This may be the Trinity. The figure below
                  this group is a nude female with long hair and prominent breasts. She faces
                  forward and to the left. She appears to be hovering soaring left to right. This is
                  Eve. Her left arm is raised horizontally and is bent upward. Her left hand may be
                  supporting her head. Eve's leg extend diagonally to the left with her left foot
                  touching the chest of the figure below. This is Adam, supine with right arm by his

                    <p>This object contains a number of light pencil markings, some of which are legible.
                  These appear to be remnants of Blake's first writing that were erased or
                  overwritten at a later stage. Crosby and Essick call attention to this
                  underwriting but do not transcribe it (page 1); they use textual notes to detail
                  many individual occurrences. In this transcription, legible underwriting has been
                  transcribed when it differs significantly from Blake's later writing in content or
                  position. When the underwritten text is identical but appears in a different
                  location, gray font has been used to distinguish underwriting from other text.
                  Please note that gray font is also used in Blake Archive transcriptions to
                  describe unclear or conjectural text. Some of the ruled lines, drawn in pencil, in
                  this object are double, fragmented, or partially erased. In some cases the ruled
                  lines bisect or lie above the text.</p>

                    <illusobjdesc>This design depicts the judgement of Adam and Eve. On the left of the
                  design are two nude figures. The leftmost figure is Adam. He faces forward and his
                  head is turned to the right in profile. He is kneeling. His right arm is bent
                  behind his back and his left arm is bent upward over his chest, palm possibly
                  vertical. He may be looking at the figure immediately to his right. This is Eve.
                  She faces forward and her head is tilted back and to the right. She has long hair
                  and is kneeling. Her left arm is by her side and bent upward with her hand
                  covering her breasts. Eve's right arm is at her side and bent slightly. Her right
                  hand covers her genitals. She appears to be looking up and to the right. On the
                  right of the design is a tree with a large, thick trunk. Loose pencil lines above
                  and around the trunk may represent branches and leaves. Two ovoid shapes hang from
                  one of the branches. These ovoids are probably fruits, indicating that this is the
                  Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. At the base of the tree is a large-headed
                  serpent. It faces left and its mouth and eye are open. It may be looking at Adam
                  and Eve. Between Adam and Eve's knees is a semi-round shape with a short vertical
                  line. This is the forbidden fruit, partially eaten by Adam and Eve. The curving
                  lines upper right may be a placeholder for God the Father.</illusobjdesc>

                    <p>This object contains a number of light pencil markings, some of which are legible.
                  These appear to be remnants of Blake's first writing that were erased or
                  overwritten at a later stage. Crosby and Essick call attention to this
                  underwriting but do not transcribe it (page 1); they use textual notes to detail
                  many individual occurrences. In this transcription, legible underwriting has been
                  transcribed when it differs significantly from Blake's later writing in content or
                  position. When the underwritten text is identical but appears in a different
                  location, gray font has been used to distinguish underwriting from other text.
                  Please note that gray font is also used in Blake Archive transcriptions to
                  describe unclear or conjectural text. Some of the ruled lines, drawn in pencil, in
                  this object bisect or lie above the text. The last several lines of text in this
                  object overlap with pencil markings that appear to belong to the illustration
                  visible below or to another drawing of Blake's (Crosby and Essick page 9n).</p>

                    <p>This object contains a number of light pencil markings, some of which are legible.
                  These appear to be remnants of Blake's first writing that were erased or
                  overwritten at a later stage. Crosby and Essick call attention to this
                  underwriting but do not transcribe it (page 1); they use textual notes to detail
                  many individual occurrences. Traces of underwriting in lines 5 through 13 suggest
                  that these lines shifted location somewhat between writings (Crosby and Essick
                  9n). In this transcription, legible underwriting has been transcribed when it
                  differs significantly from Blake's later writing in content or position. When the
                  underwritten text is identical but appears in a different location, gray font has
                  been used to distinguish underwriting from other text. Please note that gray font
                  is also used in Blake Archive transcriptions to describe unclear or conjectural
                  text. Some of the ruled lines in this object are double, fragmented, or partially
                  erased. In some cases the ruled lines bisect or lie above the text. The chapter
                  heading in this object overlaps slightly with Blake's illustration.</p>

                    <illusobjdesc>This design depicts Cain fleeing in the aftermath of Abel's murder.
                  There are two groupings of figures on either side of the design. At the lower edge
                  of the illustration, sketchy horizontal lines may depict a grave. Above the grave
                  are loose, curving horizontal lines suggesting a supine figure, probably the
                  murdered Abel. The cluster of lines on the left are Abel's head resting on the
                  knee or thigh of one of the two kneeling figures. These are Adam and Eve. The
                  figure on the left faces right in profile; the figure to the right appears to face
                  forward with head down. On the right of the design is a figure facing right, in
                  profile, with his left arm raised vertically and palm facing right or possibly
                  pointing upward. This is probably Cain fleeing. Cain's legs are apart and are bent
                  at the knees. His right leg is extended back and his right foot may be on tiptoe.
                  He is running. The cluster of lines above and slightly to the left of this figure
                  depict a soaring or hovering figure. A circle suggests a head and horizontal lines
                  extending left suggest the outline of a body. This may be God.</illusobjdesc>

                    <p>This object has 23 ruled lines. Only the first three of these contain text,
                  suggesting Blake left the work unfinished. This object also contains light pencil
                  markings, some of which are visible. These appear to be remnants of Blake's first
                  writing that were erased of overwritten at a later stage. Crosby and Essick call
                  attention to the underwriting but do not transcribe it (page 1); they use textual
                  notes to detail many individual occurences.</p>

                    <illusobjdesc>This design depicts God forgiving Cain. In the center of the design are
                  two male figures facing each other. The figure on the left faces right in profile
                  and is bending forward and down. This is God, wearing a long flowing gown. A leg,
                  possibly left leg, extends back toward the left, and the left foot appears to be
                  on tiptoe. God may be partly kneeling. The right arm of God is at the side of his
                  body and extends to the right and suggests an embrace with the figure to the
                  right. God has long hair and one slit-like eye is visible. God's head is bent down
                  and he appears to be touching the forehead of the figure to the right. This is
                  Cain, who faces left in profile and appears to be kneeling. Cain is wearing a gown
                  and his head is tilted back. One eye is open and he looks up at God. Cain's left
                  arm is raised and bent. His lower arm is vertical and rests on God's upper right
                  arm, suggesting an embrace. Cain's left foot is visible. Below God and Cain is a
                  convex arc representing the surface of the Earth. To the right of the design are a
                  cluster of pencil lines that depict a structure with a steep sloping roof. In
                  front of this structure are the outlines of two figures with bowed heads, facing
                  left. These are Adam and Eve. Above the structure and to the left of God are
                  curving lines that may represent clouds.</illusobjdesc>
