                <objnote><p>The pencil inscription immediately below the design, "The Reposing Traveller," was written by Blake.  The British Museum collection stamp appears lower left. This is one of seven monochrome wash drawings (Objects 37-43) by Blake of figures painted by Michelangelo in the Sistine Chapel. They were very probably copied from the engravings of Adamo Ghisi, after drawings by Giorgio Ghisi, published in *Pitture dipinte nella Volta della Capella Sistina nel Vaticano* (1773). The wash drawing, *Manasses*, is on the recto of this leaf.</p>
                   <p>Frederick Tatham added a pen and ink inscription in the lower right corner of the leaf bearing this drawing.</p></objnote>

                    <illusobjdesc>This wash drawing, after a portion of Michelangelo’s Sistine Ceiling, is presumably of the biblical figure Aminadab, identified as a “Reposing Traveller” in the inscription below the image. He sits forward, directly facing the viewer on a large block. The slope of his shoulders suggests that he is hunched slightly forward. His arms extend downwards so that his elbows rest on his thighs and his hands dangle between his bare legs. His hands cross at the wrist, with his right hand in the front and index finger pointed down. He left hand is turned to the side and touches his right knee. Both hands hold a piece of fabric, probably part of his tunic, that drapes in between his legs. His prominent, bare knees are parallel to his shoulders and his legs meet at the ankles to form a triangular shape with the left foot crossed in front of the right. Four toes of his left foot rest on the ground and the heel is slightly raised, while the right foot appears to rest against the block. He wears a short tunic with a scooped neckline that reveals a portion of chest, and a long-sleeved shirt is visible under the tunic sleeves. Part of the tunic drapes down the left side of the block. His mouth is closed and his brows are furrowed. His long, wavy hair appears to be fastened with a headband, but wisps break free and frame the right side of his face. The block on which the figure sits rests on a bare floor. The background is plain, perhaps representing a bare wall behind the figure.</illusobjdesc>
