A "voice from heaven" tells the Babylonian monarch that he will "be with the beasts of the field."  The prophecy is fulfilled immediately, and Nebuchadnezzar grows "hairs ... like eagles' feathers" and "nails like birds' claws."  For Blake, this image probably represented the descent of a mighty ruler, and perhaps all of humanity, into a state of fallen nature.</p><p>The title, "Nebuchadnezzar," is inscribed in pencil below the design, almost certainly not by Blake.</p></objnote><objsize>44.6 x 62.0 cm.</objsize><windowsize width="600" height="550"/></physdesc><illusdesc><illustration type="plate" location="E"><illusobjdesc>Nebuchadnezzar, transformed into a nude, beast-like figure with claw-like nails and long, shaggy hair and beard, crawls towards the right but turns his head to face the viewer.

Feather-like fur covers part of Nebuchadnezzar’s torso and continues to his knees.  His right leg is extended behind his left leg.  His right foot has its toes spread on tiptoe, perhaps digging into the ground.  His facial expression is a mixture of despair, horror, and fear with his mouth open and his eyes wide and downcast.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="vegetation" location="E"><characteristic>tree</characteristic><characteristic>trunk</characteristic><characteristic>leaning</characteristic><characteristic>cave</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The trunks of two large trees lean towards each other behind Nebuchadnezzar.
