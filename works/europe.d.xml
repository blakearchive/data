                         <note>
                              The pen and ink inscriptions, attributed by Bentley (page 159) and others to George Cumberland, are available as Supplemental Views in the Archive for each object on which they appear.  Most are quoted from Edward Bysshe, 
                              *The Art of English Poetry*
                              , a popular and often reprinted anthology of English verse, arranged by subject and first published in 1702.  Shared textual variants indicate that Bysshe was the source, as first pointed out in S. Foster Damon, 
                              *William Blake: His Philosophy and Symbols*
                              (1924), pages 347-51.  We have surveyed several editions of Bysshe through the ninth (1762), the last edition known to us that was published prior to the etching of 
                              *Europe a Prophecy*
                              .  The pencil inscriptions, also available as Supplemental Views, would appear to have been written in a hand different from the pen and ink inscriptions and may be of a later date.  The leaves are stamped on their rectos with a British Museum collection mark which, on some objects, extends into the image.</note>

                         <illusobjdesc>An old, nude, but muscular man with long hair and 
beard squats within a circle, perhaps meant to represent the disc 
of the sun.  His hair and beard extend horizontally to the left, 
as though blown by a strong wind from right to left.  His left 
leg is bent at the knee, with both left knee and left foot 
prominent.  His right leg is kneeling, with the lower leg bent 
back, on the edge of the circle.  He is hunched over and looks 
down or has his eyes closed; his left arm is extended down.  He holds a pair of dividers 
or compasses in his left hand, with his forefinger spread away 
from his other fingers.  Indications of a robe or some 
sort of drapery appear just right of the figure's left foot.  
Beams of light emanate from the circle, surrounded by clouds 
except where the man's arm extends downward.  The figure is very 
probably Urizen in the act of creating and/or circumscribing the 
material universe.  This design, perhaps Blake's most famous, has 
also been titled by critics &quot;The Ancient of Days&quot; and &quot;God 
Creating the Universe.&quot;</illusobjdesc>

                         <illusobjdesc>The pictorial image is treated as a full-plate 
design.  A giant snake is coiled just above the imprint.  Its 
upper body reaches upward in two loops, suggesting a spiral, with its head facing to 
the right.  The small crest on top of its head in other copies is only hinted at here.  Its mouth is open, and its long forked tongue is prominent.  Its body extends beyond the lower right 
margin of the plate and then returns under the imprint, with its 
tail ending below &quot;Blake&quot; (line 5) in the imprint.  The slightly mottled color 
printing of the snake's body suggests scales.  Below the two 
large coils of its lower body and right of &quot;Lambeth&quot; (line 4) in the 
imprint are some vegetative forms, perhaps leaves.  The washes 
behind the snake's coils suggest sky, possibly with clouds, hills, or mountains.  The snake has been identified as the 
serpent-form of Orc, the personification of revolutionary 
energy.</illusobjdesc>

                         <illusobjdesc>Two figures appear in the landscape above the text.  
A nude male sits crouching in a contracted posture within a cave 
surrounded at its mouth with large stones.  His legs are drawn up 
and his legs crossed at the ankles.  He faces to the left, toward 
the other figure.  His left arm is bent at the elbow, with his 
forearm and index finger on his left hand pointing up.  He grasps a 
knife or dagger in his right hand.  He may be an assassin, 
contemplating the murder of the figure to the left.  This figure 
on the left is a youthful male wearing tights, a hat, a bundle or 
backpack on his back, and belts over his chest.  He strides 
forward and to the left.  He faces left and holds a walking-stick 
in his right hand.  His left arm is bent at the elbow, with his 
left forearm and hand behind his back.  He is probably one of 
Blake's representations of a traveler.  Below his feet is a path 
or road.  Right and left of this walking figure is some undifferentiated vegetation, 
perhaps the leaves of trees; the vegetation is particularly leafy above the cave with the assassin and right of the traveler's right foot.</illusobjdesc>

falls head-first.  His legs are bent at the knees, with the left 
leg drawn up near his chest.  His arms are raised over his head 
and bent at the elbows with his hands behind his head.  A large

                         <illusobjdesc>There is a good deal of interlinear decoration, 
particularly in the margins of the text.  Most consists of vines 
and leaves, but there are also a few animals.  The first letter 
of the first word in line 3 twists into a spiral vine on the left; it descends with one further loop in the left margin to line 11.  A long, wavy vine extends between lines 5 and 6.  On it is a 
long-legged spider, just above &quot;other sons&quot; in line 6.
Further to the left, under the first word of line 5, is a small 
form that may be a fly, moth, or butterfly.  A vine trails 
downward from this same first word (&quot;And&quot;) in line 5.  Just left of the beginning of line 14 is a 
flying creature, perhaps an insect of some sort.  In the bottom 
left corner of the plate, a vine descends from the first letter 
of the first word in the last line of text (line 17).  In the right margin, 
another branch of the vine extending between lines 5 and 6 descends from the design above the text all the way to the lower 
margin.  It bears loops, at least two types of leaves, and perhaps some fruit or flowers.  A butterfly sits on the upper reaches of this vine (opposite line 5); a worm or caterpillar inches its way across the upper reaches of a large, slender leaf opposite the space between lines 9 and 10; and there may be another insect resting on a leaf just to the left of the worm or caterpillar.  Other branches of this vine extend above the falling figure and intertwine with the large leaf to the right of this same figure.  To the right are two flying birds.  A separate vine with spiky leaves twists right of lines 6 and 7, growing from the &quot;d&quot; in &quot;thunder.&quot;  Below one of its tendrils, and just to the right of line 9, is a flying insect, perhaps a beetle or fly.  A somewhat 
jagged vine extends horizontally following line 8; to the right 
is another vine, growing from the top of the second letter of

                         <illusobjdesc>Although containing considerable text, the plate is 
treated as a full-page design showing four nude males in the sky. 
The two text areas are shaped like clouds.  Upper right, we see a 
figure from behind with his left leg bent and his left foot 
poised on a cloud extending down and to the left.  His right leg 
is extended; he may be rising.  We do not see his arms, but his 
hands clutch his head.  This gesture suggests despair.  His hair 
may be curly.  Below is a group of three wrestling figures, all 
nude and bald.  The central figure has his legs spread, with his 
left leg extended and his right bent at the knee with his right 
foot below his groin.  He looks down and to the right.  With his right arm he 
grasps another bald nude around the neck, apparently in an 
attempt to strangle him.  This central figure's left arm is bent 
at the elbow and he grasps the neck of another bald nude with his 
left hand.  The figure on the left has his legs spread and bent 
at the knees.  He looks up and to the right and tries, with both 
hands, to release the central male's arm from around his neck.  
The wrestler on the right has his legs spread, with his left leg 
extended vertically and his right leg bent at the knee.  His arms 
are bent back over his shoulders and grasp the left leg of the 
central male.  All three figures have caricature-like facial 
expressions suggesting fear and pain (figures right and left) or desperation and cruelty (central figure).  The background behind the 
wrestlers is formed of dark and perhaps stormy 
clouds.</illusobjdesc>

                         <illusobjdesc>Although the plate contains a good deal of text and 
a great deal of interlinear decoration, the major pictorial 
motifs—the sky and the two largest figures—constitute a full- 
plate design.  The three text panels are shaped like, and may 
represent, clouds floating in the sky.  The largest figure, 
hovering horizontally in the air just below the heading, is a 
gowned female.  The hem of her garment forms a snake-like tail.  Her body is twisted, facing forward below the waist and facing down above the waist.  Her long hair cascades over (and 
hence obscures) her face.  Her arms are bent at the elbows and 
her hands are clasped behind her head.  She has large 
wings, and thus may be an angel.  More specifically, in the 
context of this poem, she has been identified as Enitharmon, a 
nature goddess of fallen time and space, and as the &quot;nameless 
shadowy female&quot; (Plate 3, line 3) who wraps a 
&quot;turban of thick clouds&quot; around her &quot;lab'ring head&quot; (Plate 3, line 14).  Below 
her cascading hair is a nude, youthful male in a contracted 
posture.  He seems confined by the circle in which he sits.  This 
circle may be meant to represent a globe; it has been described 
as a comet, although there is no tail.  It may be a planet.  His 
legs are bent at the knees and drawn up to his chest; his arms 
are bent at the elbows with his hands, formed into fists, against 
his cheeks just below his eyes.  He faces forward.  Flames surround him within the globe.  This may be Orc, the spirit of revolution here confined, 
the &quot;secret child&quot; (of Enitharmon?) mentioned on the plate (line 5), 
or one of Enitharmon's &quot;vig'rous progeny of fires&quot; (Plate 4, line 9).  The other motifs on this plate, including many human figures, will be treated as interlinear designs.</illusobjdesc>

                         <illusobjdesc>The heading is surrounded by several figures and 
vegetative motifs.  The figures, particularly the larger ones, 
may be the &quot;sons &amp; daughters&quot; (line 9) of Enitharmon referred to on 
the plate.  The lower left corner of &quot;A&quot; (in &quot;A / PROPHECY&quot; [lines 2-3]) grows 
into a long vine with branches.  Standing on this vine, near the 
left foot of the letter, is a human figure facing forward.  His 
or her arms, raised vertically, grow into limbs of a tree that 
bend downwards, as with a willow.  The motif suggests the 
classical myth of Daphne and her vegetating metamorphosis.  This 
parallel suggests that the figure is female.  On the right diagonal 
of the &quot;A&quot; are three leaves.  To the left of the &quot;A&quot; and slightly below it is a male(?) 
embracing a female.  Both hover in the air, with the male on the 
right and facing to the left.  The male is nude; the woman is gowned and has a long, snake-like tail of drapery 
extending from her right leg.  The man's body is twisted into a 
curve, seen from behind.  His left arm is raised horizontally and 
embraces the woman's waist.  His right leg is extended 
horizontally.  We also see the woman from behind, with her body 
twisted into a curve matching the man's.  Both her arms are 
raised horizontally, with her head facing down.  These gestures 
suggest that she is trying to escape from the man.  In contrast, 
the couple right of the letter &quot;A&quot; is embracing mutually and 
appear to be kissing.  The winged male(?), possibly an angel, hovers 
horizontally in the air, with his arms raised at 45 degrees to 
embrace the woman(?) who hovers vertically.  She too is winged and 
may be an angel.  Her legs are bent back and her arms raised at 
135 degrees to embrace her companion.  He faces down and to the 
left; she faces up and to the right.  Below the &quot;A&quot; is a hunched 
over, and apparently gowned, figure facing to the left.  This 
extremely contracted figure, with his or her upper body and head 
bent down to touch the upper legs, sits on a cloud outline.  
Other cloud outlines extend to the upper right and below 
&quot;PROPHECY&quot; in the heading.  On the right, below a cloud outline 
and above the last letter of &quot;PROPHECY,&quot; two nude figures seen 
from behind soar in the sky, left arms raised horizontally and 
right arms raised at 135 degrees.  The letters of &quot;PROPHECY&quot; are 
well decorated with eight human figures and vines.  Proceeding 
from left to right, these include a vine with leaves or lily-like 
flowers intertwined with the first letter and extending to the 
second.  A small standing figure holds the vertical of the first 
&quot;P.&quot;  Another figure stands on the foot of the vertical of the 
&quot;R&quot; and faces to the left with arms raised vertically.  Above 
this figure is a small form that may be a descending child or 
infant, arms stretched downward toward the adult.  The right foot 
of the &quot;R&quot; bears a very small seated figure, hunched over and 
facing to the right.  The letter &quot;O&quot; has two vines with lily-like 
flowers.  Standing within the &quot;O&quot; is a figure facing forward and 
with left arm raised horizontally to hold a shepherd's crook.  To 
the right of this shepherd is a small flock of sheep.  Three 
vines, or perhaps flames, spring from the foot of the second &quot;P.&quot; 
A vine, perhaps with a few leaves, is intertwined with the next 
three letters (&quot;HEC&quot;).  The final vine in this group springs from 
the foot of the final letter and forms a spiral above and to the 
right of the letter.  This &quot;Y&quot; also bears three human figures.  
One, seen from behind and with legs spread and arms raised 
vertically, seems to be climbing, with the right foot on the foot 
of the &quot;Y&quot; and the left foot on the &quot;C.&quot;  Above, standing on the 
top left end of the &quot;Y,&quot; is a figure.  
Finally, the first bend in the vine growing from the right side 
of the final letter bears a seated figure facing right, with back 
slightly hunched over and right arm extended to the right knee.  
This figure holds a book or tablet and is probably reading.  Two 
flames, or perhaps a flame-like plant, spring from the foot of 
the &quot;Y&quot; on its right side.</illusobjdesc>

much smaller vine or single leaf grows from the vertical of the last letter in

the other bent at the knee.  The figure faces up; his arms are raised at 135 degrees relative to his body.  The figure above may be gowned (note the slight indication of a tail of drapery) and of 
uncertain gender.  This figure's legs are spread and one arm (the 
left?) is raised vertically.  The figure may be rising in the 
air.  To the right, above &quot;Enitharmon&quot; in line 9, is a flying bird.  
Another two birds fly on extended wings above the last word 
(&quot;come&quot;) in line 13.  A cloud outline (or perhaps the surface of 
the earth?) below and to the right of the birds bears a figure 
crawling to the right on all fours.  Further to the right, 
another figure, gowned(?) and perhaps female, stands and leans to the 
left against the cloud outline.  Her legs are 
crossed.</illusobjdesc>

                    <p>This pen and ink inscription appears below the image. The first four lines
                        are quoted from John Milton, 
                        *Paradise Lost*

                         <illusobjdesc>The design below the text is dominated by two large 
figures and five smaller ones.  A nude and youthful male lies 
prone on the ground—or perhaps on a bed of straw.  He faces 
down, with his arms bent and his head resting on them.  His hair 
is curly and a halo of fire surrounds his head.  This is probably 
the youthful Orc.  Above him, a nude female with long, flame-like 
hair kneels on a cloud and leans dramatically to the left.  Her 
left leg is extended and her right bent at the knee under her 
torso.  Her arms are extended horizontally and she holds, and 
apparently lifts with both hands, a cloak, blanket, or heavy 
drapery to uncover the youth below, at whom she is looking.  She 
is probably Enitharmon.  The five much smaller figures above may 
be her sons and daughters.  In the left corner of the design, 
just below the text, we see a nude figure lying supine on a cloud 
with legs bent and spread, body twisted to the left.  The head position and gender of this figure are uncertain; his or her 
posture suggests erotic exhaustion.  Similar exhaustion is 
indicated by the nude figure to the right.  This figure is 
probably female and also lies supine on a cloud.  Her body is 
bent back, with her head, right arm, and right leg dangling 
downward.  Above and to the 
right is another nude female, sitting or lying supine on a cloud with her 
upper body propped up with her bent right arm.  She faces right 
and probably has long hair.  Her right leg is extended to the 
right and her left leg bent at the knee.  Further to the right is 
an embracing couple hovering in the air, with the woman on the 
right.  They may be kissing.  The nude male, facing right, has 
his legs spread and his right arm raised horizontally.  The 
female, facing left, is gowned—or at least has a tail of drapery 
curling over her raised left leg.  Her legs are spread apart.  
Her long hair is gathered into a bun.</illusobjdesc>

a beetle or moth), a butterfly or moth, and a bird.  Another 
winged creature, perhaps an insect, flies right of lines 8-9.  Left 
and right of this creature are two vines; the vine on the right is very worm-like.  A vine below line 10 
includes one loop and a grain tassel on its right end.  A 
grasshopper or locust stands on this vine, facing right.  Three 
winged insects fly above the grain tassel.  Another vine appears 
further to the right, with at least one leaf and three loops.  
Vines, or extensions of a cloud outline, extend below line 15.  A 
bird flies on extended wings above the first word (&quot;Then&quot;) in 
line 18 and a vine grows from the &quot;h&quot; of the next word

                         <illusobjdesc>The setting is an enclosed interior space with a 
floor and a stone back wall.  A fireplace with a grate and an 
arched top is at the center of the back wall and of the 
composition.  A coal fire burns on the grate.  Above is a large 
cooking pot with a handle suspended from the top of the fireplace 
by a rod, possibly with a hook at its lower end.  Clouds of smoke or steam billow above the pot.  In 
the foreground are three figures.  On the left is a gowned woman, 
facing right and in an extremely contracted posture.  She sits or 
squats on the floor with her legs drawn up to her chest and her 
right arm wrapped around her right knee.  Her head is down 
between her knees; her long hair cascades to the ground.  The 
gowned woman on the right sits in a chair. 
Her prominent knees are drawn up toward her chest, with legs 
crossed.  Her arms are apparently also crossed, with her left 
hand near her right breast and her right hand near her left 
breast.  She wears a necklace of beads and faces up with a 
worried or pained expression, perhaps looking at the pot.  Below 
the woman in the chair is a male child, nude, rigid, and lying 
supine on a cloth spread on the floor.  His eyes are closed 
and he is probably dead.  His hair may be curly.  Some 
interpreters have described this design as a scene of famine, 
including the contemplation of cannibalism by the woman above the 
child's corpse.</illusobjdesc>

                         <illusobjdesc>The background of the design is composed of a brick 
wall with a large wooden door.  A dark shadow cuts diagonally 
across the upper right part of the door and wall.  The closed 
door is inscribed &quot;LORD [H]AVE MERC[Y] ON US&quot; with a cross below 
the inscription.  Left of the door is a standing, and perhaps 
walking, figure wearing a heavy black coat.  He faces left, looks 
down with a worried expression, and wears a large and dark bicorn 
hat.  His left arm is at his side and he holds a large bell in 
his left hand.  This bellman, as well as the inscription on the 
door (typical of quarantined houses) can be associated with the 
theme of plague dominating the design.  Since his mouth is slightly 
open, he may be calling out, &quot;Bring out your dead!&quot;  Below the bellman on the 
left are a man and woman.  The man, wearing a gown or at least a 
shirt, appears against the left margin of the plate in profile, 
facing right and down, and perhaps holds the woman with his right arm.  
His hair is curly.  The gowned woman sits on the ground, with her 
upper body propped up by the man.  Her hair is long and her arms 
are at her side.  Her face, with mouth open like her companion’s, 
expresses despair and perhaps pain, and the limp posture of her body indicates that she may be weak with plague.   To the right, a 
gowned woman with long hair seems to be falling on her knees.  
Her arms are raised vertically as if in supplication, with the 
fingers of both hands spread apart.  She faces up, with her head 
bent back and her mouth slightly open.</illusobjdesc>

during the great plague of London in 1665.</illusobjdesc>

figures standing before billowing clouds (or possibly smoke) with darkness on the left.  A gowned and elderly male with long hair and beard stands

His worried expression, staring eyes, and arm gesture suggest 
that he is afraid of some unpictured presence to the left.  He 
may be Albion's Angel, frightened at the prospect of coming 
revolution.  A gowned woman kneels on the ground before the old 
man, with right leg extended backward and left leg bent at the knee.  Her 
body is bent forward and her head down.  Her right arm is raised 
horizontally and she embraces the old man around his legs.  Her 
long, curled hair cascades below her right upper arm.  She may be 
supplicating the man for help.  This may be a night scene.</illusobjdesc>

Several vines, at least one of which bears ivy-like leaves, are

from behind; her long hair is formed into a loose bun.  She 
hovers in the air, with her right leg extended and her left bent 
at the knee.  Her body and head are twisted to the right.  She 
holds in her raised right hand, and no doubt plays, a large, 
coiled horn or trumpet.  The black spots of blight covering the 
grain appear to emanate from the trumpet and the one her male 
companion plays.  He is also nude, seen from behind, and has his 
body twisted dramatically to the right.  His left leg is 
extended, his right bent at the knee as he hovers in the air.  He 
holds his coiled horn or trumpet with his left hand.  Both arms 
are raised horizontally.  His hair is curly.  In this copy, his face is obscured.</illusobjdesc>

                         <illusobjdesc>A gowned male sits on a throne-like chair, the chair 
in turn resting on a cloud.  He faces forward and wears the 
triple-crown of a Pope.  His face, however, may be a caricature 
of George III.  He holds on his lap an open book.  Large, bat- 
like wings extend from behind his arms.  The back of his 
chair resembles the facade of a gothic church, with arches and 
spires right and left.  His gown between his legs seems to 
contain embroidered pictures of perhaps two gowned and standing figures, although their 
representation is very unclear in this copy.  Below this Pope, 
and below the cloud, are two female angels, right and left, with 
large wings.  Both have long hair, are gowned, bow and look down, 
and have one arm extended at 45 degrees.  Each holds in her 
extended hand a scepter or staff with a fleur-de-lis point at its 
lower termination.  These two angels have small snake-like tails (or simply vines) projecting from their gowns at their feet.</illusobjdesc>

                         <illusobjdesc>The illustration, dominated by spider webs, extends 
along the right margin, extends between lines 21 and 22 of the 
text, and fills the bottom margin of the plate.  Top right is a 
cluster of lines that apparently represents a web; the other 
webs are pictured with finer lines.  At least five 
spiders appear on the web: right of lines 15-17 (hard to make out in this copy), right of line 
20, in a dense web below the first word (&quot;Fled&quot;) in line 21, 
above &quot;wide&quot; in line 24, and right of lines 29-32 (dangling on a 
single thread).  What may be a sixth spider appears above &quot;&amp; 
louder&quot; at the end of line 15.  A great many insects appear in 
the design, although some are simply suggested by little more 
than dots.  The larger and more identifiable insects are a winged 
insect right of lines 11-13, a fly or butterfly further to the 
right and just below the cluster of lines in the top right corner, 
perhaps a fly below this insect, four flies (two very small) 
right of lines 15-17, a large winged insect (a beetle?) right of 
line 21 and half-way to the right margin, a caterpillar below and 
to the left of this last insect, another winged fly or beetle 
above and to the right of the spider between lines 21 and 22, and 
a large fly or beetle (and a cluster of very small insects) below 
&quot;he drag'd&quot; in line 21.  The landscape below the text is filled 
with heavy vegetation, including low plants with large leaves and 
a vine with one loop and two large leaves intertwined with the 
spider web in the lower right corner.  Just to the left is a nude figure, of uncertain gender, sitting on the ground and completely covered by a fine net or web.  The legs are bent at the knees and the body is twisted so that the figure faces forward.  The head is bent back and she or he looks up (although the eyes may be closed).  The upper body is braced up on the elbows.  The hands are held together in an attitude of supplication or prayer.  This figure may relate to the image of &quot;every man bound&quot; (line 27).</illusobjdesc>

                         <illusobjdesc>This text plate contains many interlinear vines, 
birds, insects, and three snakes.  Four or five 
butterflies appear right of lines 2-5.  A vine descends from the 
first letter of the first word in line 7.  Two vines grow from 
the first letter of the first word in line 10.  Vines, at least 
three birds, an insect(?) on a leaf, and flames decorate the space 
between lines 6 and 7.  A butterfly and two other winged insects, 
two vines (one may be a worm), and an odd shape that may be two 
moths flying close together appear between lines 9 and 10.  A vine 
with multiple branches and leaves wends its way through the 
margin right of lines 9-20.  At least one flower, shaped like a 
Meadia, grows close to the right margin of the plate, right of 
line 10.  Another such flower appears below and to the left of the 
first one, right of line 13.  On and around this large vine are an inch worm (below the last word in line 9),
caterpillars (above and to the right of line 15 and right of 
lines 10-11 and 16-17), a spider (right of line 15), and several flying 
insects.  Five flying insects (at least one a butterfly) follow 
line 12.  A vine descends left from the first word in line 16.  A 
vine with two loops grows from the descender of the last letter 
of &quot;thy&quot; in line 21.  A large bird, possibly an eagle, and three 
smaller birds or insects fly near the right margin of the plate 
right of lines 19-21.  A vine with many loops fills the 
considerable space between lines 21 and 22 and descends in the 
right margin to line 27.  On this vine are at least two large and 
two small caterpillars, an inch-worm, two snails, at least three 
spiders, at least two insects with wings folded, and a bird perched near the right margin with its mouth 
open (because it is singing?).  Just to the left, within loops of the vine, is another singing bird, facing left with mouth open.  A large moth or butterfly appears 
below &quot;Antamon&quot; in line 21.  A flying insect is pictured far to the right of 
line 24.  Below and to the left is a large bird (possibly an 
eagle) soaring upwards, with a flock of five birds to the left.  
The form right of lines 27-31 probably represents the sky.  A 
vine descends from the second letter of &quot;my&quot; in line 26.  A vine 
with leaves and several branches appears right of lines 29-38.  Intertwined with this vine is a snake, 
facing to the left with its mouth open and its forked tongue 
clearly pictured.  Two other snakes, both facing left, appear in 
the bottom margin.  The right-most snake in the lower margin has 
a clearly pictured tongue.  The last letter of the last word in 
line 35 grows into a vine.</illusobjdesc>

                         <illusobjdesc>Below the text, a nude, muscular male with curly 
hair stands with legs spread apart, his genitals obscured by what may be semi-opaque drapery of some sort. 
His left leg is extended to the right, with his left foot on the 
ground.  His right leg is bent at the knee with his foot on one 
of at least two stone steps.  He may be striding to the left.  
His body faces forward, but his head is turned to the right.  His 
expression is fearful or pained.  He may be looking at the flames 
forming the background of the design or at the young girl whose 
left arm he grasps with his lowered left hand.  Perhaps the man 
is her father, attempting to rescue the child from the flames.  
She wears a gown and has long hair.  We see her from behind; her 
right arm is drawn back and raised at 135 degrees.  Her left leg is extended 
backward; she may be striding to the left.  The nude male 
carries, over his right shoulder, the limp body of a gowned 
woman—perhaps the child's mother.  The man's right arm is 
raised, bent at the elbow, and embraces the woman around the 
waist.  Her left arm and long hair dangle down toward the man's 
right knee.  Her gown, and presumably her legs, dangle behind the 
man's spread legs.  She may be dead or dying.  Lower left, on 
top of the steps, is a fluted and broken pillar.</illusobjdesc>
