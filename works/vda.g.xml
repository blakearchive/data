            The William Blake Archive http://www.blakearchive.org is pleased to announce the publication of new electronic editions of <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> Copy J and <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> Copy G.<lb/><lb/><hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> is dated 1789 by Blake on the title page, but the first plate (Thel's Motto) and the last (her descent into the netherworld) appear to have been completed and first printed in 1790, while Blake was working on <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>. Copy J is from the first of three printings of <hi rend="i">Thel</hi>, during which Blake produced at least thirteen copies, printed in five different inks to diversify his stock. Copies from this press run were certainly on hand when Blake included the book in his advertisement "To the Public" of October 1793: "The Book of Thel, a Poem in Illuminated Printing. Quarto, with 6 designs, price 3s." Copy J joins copies in the Archive from the other two printings: Copy F, printed and colored c. 1795, and Copy O, printed and colored c. 1818. It also joins Copy H, which is from the first printing, and, like Copy J, is printed in green ink and lightly finished in watercolors. Copy J, however, was recolored when two of its questions ("Why a tender curb upon the youthful burning boy!/Why a little curtain of flesh on the bed of our desire?") on Plate 8 were deleted. The lines were scraped away from the paper, apparently by Blake, since the washes over it--and those added to the other texts as well--are in his hand. This second tinting also included pen and ink outlining, the modeling of figures through the addition of complementary colors and shadows, and the over-painting of Thel's yellow dress with green on Plate 6. Texts streaked in light yellows, pinks, and blues were characteristic of Blake's later coloring style and suggest that the recoloring occurred around the time the work was sold, c. 1816.<lb/><lb/>
            This refinishing may have been undertaken to make the book more compatible with the dark hues of <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> Copy G, with which it appears to have been sold, and with which it was bound, probably by their original owner, c. 1816. In keeping with the poem's dark events and brooding mood, the hand coloring of <hi rend="i">Visions</hi> Copy G is impressively detailed and sombre. Rather than tinting the designs with semi-transparent washes in single hues, as in the first coloring session, Blake layered his colors to deepen the tones. This style shows the influence of color printing on Blake's hand coloring during the 1794-96 period. The techniques used for Copy G even include some stipple-like effects imitating the reticulations caused by color printing. Washes were also added in text margins on Plates 5, 7, 10, and 11, with a splendid sunrise bursting into the text on Plate 3, as in late Copies O and P. Copy G is unusual in other respects as well. The frontispiece and title page are placed sequentially, as in Copies O and P, rather than facing each other, but uniquely with the title page coming first. This unconventional arrangement is confirmed by Blake's pen and ink plate numbers. He originally etched numbers 2-3, 5-7 in the top right corners of Plates 5-6, 8-10, but all leaves in Copy G are foliated in pen and ink in a single sequence, 1-11,with the new numbers written over the old on Plates 5-6, 8-9.<lb/><lb/>
            Copy G was printed and colored c. 1795 as part of a set of illuminated books printed on large paper and joins other works from that set now in the Archive (<hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> Copy F, <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> Copy D, <hi rend="i">There is No Natural Religion</hi> Copy L, <hi rend="i">All Religions are One</hi> Copy A, and <hi rend="i">America, a Prophecy</hi> Copy A) and forthcoming (<hi rend="i">The First Book of Urizen</hi> Copy B and <hi rend="i">Europe, a Prophecy</hi> Copy H). It also joins copies of <hi rend="i">Visions</hi> in the Archive from other printings: Copies C and J, different issues from the first printing of 1793, and Copy F, color printed c. 1794. Copy P, an exemplary copy from the fourth and final printing of c. 1818, is forthcoming.<lb/><lb/>
            In Blake's advertisement, <hi rend="i">Visions</hi> was described as "Folio, with 8 designs, price 7s.6d." Copy G, though, was trimmed to quarto size when bound with <hi rend="i">Thel</hi> Copy J. Both works are now in the Houghton Library, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts.<lb/><lb/>
            The electronic editions have newly edited SGML-encoded texts and new images scanned and color-corrected from first-generation 8x10" transparencies; they are each fully searchable for both text and images and supported by the Inote and ImageSizer applications described in our previous updates.<lb/><lb/>
            With the publication of these two titles, the Archive now contains 37 copies of 18 separate books, including at least one copy of every one of Blake's works in illuminated printing except the 100 plates of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> (forthcoming).

waves in the lower margin, heavy clouds, rain, and eleven human
figures.  The angle of the waves suggests a strong wind blowing
from left to right.  A nude female runs toward us with her right
foot touching a trough between waves, lower center.  She is
probably the central female figure in the poem, Oothoon, who
"over the waves ... went" (Plate 4, line 17).  Her left leg is extended behind
her, her arms are raised at 135 degrees, and the fingers of both
hands are separated and extended.  She appears to look back and
up; her long hair streams back and to the right as though blown
by a wind.  She may be looking at the figure hovering in the air
above her, a bearded male who looks directly at the viewer and
may be pursuing Oothoon.  This threatening male may be Bromion,
Oothoon's tormentor in the poem; or Urizen, the evil sky-god
(among other attributes) also named in the text.  We see only his
head and face, shoulders, and arms and hands wrapped around his
shoulders in a contracted posture.  His large wings extend
horizontally.  His face is heavily lined, particularly the
forehead.  Flames spring from below his wings and rise above
them.  To the left is a ring of three female figures pictured as
though nude but with the twisted, spiraling hems of gowns
trailing behind them.  They form a circle, as though
participating in an ecstatic dance.  The figure at the bottom of
the right holds hands with her two companions.  Her arms are
extended horizontally and her legs are spread apart as though she
were striding energetically to the right.  Her head is turned away from the viewer.  The dancer furthest to the left
also has her arms extended horizontally (relative to her body);
her head is tilted back as though she were looking up.  Like her
companion below, a strand of long hair extends from her head.
The final dancer, top right in the circle, has her arms raised at
135 degrees and has her legs spread.  Her back and neck are
arched backwards and she appears to be looking up.  Above the
ring of dancers, and just left of the first diagonal of the
letter "A" of "Albion" in line 5, is a slender,
nude figure seen from the side with at least one arm extended
downward.  She may be holding a small scepter in her extended
hand.  This figure, probably female, seems to be descending
head-first.  
To the left of this figure, near the left margin of the
plate, is a nude figure, probably female, seen from the side and
sitting on a cloud.  Her knees are drawn up towards her head,
which is tilted down and to the left.  Her left arm, which we see
only from the shoulder to the elbow, extends behind her as though
it is propping her up or possibly bound behind her.  To the right
of these two figures, and near the center of the plate, is a
figure, probably female and gowned, sitting on a cloud just above
the letters "b" and "i" of "Albion" in line 5.
She faces to the left and we see only her left side.  Her upper
body and head are bent over at such a sharp angle that they touch
her upper left leg.  In this contracted posture, her long hair
cascades over her left knee.  Higher along the left margin of the
design and left of the word "of" in line 3 are
two figures on a cloud.  Both appear to be nude; at least the one
on the left is probably female.  We see this figure on the left
from behind.  Her upper body is bent over, with her left arm
extending downwards (perhaps touching the head of the figure
below) and her long hair cascading downwards.  Her right arm is
bent sharply at the elbow as though braced for support or
balance.  Her companion to the right lies on the cloud, with her
or his prominent knees on the left in a twisted and contracted
posture.  We apparently see only the top of her or his head; the
figure may be looking down.  The left arm is bent at the elbow
with the left hand beneath the head.  To the right, and right of
the word "of" in line 3, is a nude and possibly
bearded male with legs crossed.  He sits on a cloud.  His hair is
long; he faces down and to the right.  He leans to the right,
with arms raised at 45 degrees (but horizontally relative to his
body) and extended downward and to the right.  The fingers of
both hands are spread and extended as though he were casting down
the slight indications of rain (merely white lines against a dark
background) lower in the design.  Slightly below and to the right
of the winged figure, the rain appears to be cascading over
cliffs (these resemble old men in some copies, but the
indications of the human form are too slight for such a
conclusion in this copy).  A rainbow arches dramatically from
lower left, through the ring of dancers, and ends below the
figure with crossed legs upper right. The words of the title are
integrated into the design and seem to float on clouds.  The
motto and imprint appear to float on the sea below the two
waves.</illusobjdesc><component type="object" location="CD"><characteristic>sea</characteristic><characteristic>storm</characteristic><characteristic>waves</characteristic><characteristic>water</characteristic><characteristic>wind</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The lower quarter of the plate is dominated by two

blowing left to right.  The horizontal patches below the word "of" in line 4 may be cliffs over which the rain cascades.

cave that opens onto the sea.  Heavy clouds fill the sky, but
fail to cover the disc of the sun.  The shape of the area where the sun appears suggests and eye socket, perhaps within a skull outlined by the cave's mouth and in left profile.  Indeterminate vegetation
dangles from the roof of the cave.  The figures sit or kneel on
large stones or, in the case of the single female, perhaps on
sand.  Water may intrude into the area of the cave below the
figures.  On the left is a heavily-muscled and bearded male seen
in left profile.  He sits or squats on sand or stones at the
cave's mouth.  He looks to the left with wide-open eyes; his face
is deeply marked by fear or worse; his hair stands on end.  His
mouth is open and he may be howling.  His knees are drawn up in a
contracted position; his right arm is drawing backwards as though
bound behind him.  A large shackle is affixed to his left ankle;
three links of a massive chain descend below his left hip.  He
may be bound back to back with the female directly to the right.
This pair is probably Oothoon, the central female figure in the
poem, and her tormentor Bromion.  She kneels, with her body bent
down and to the right.  The right-most link of the chain below
Bromion may be attached to Oothoon.  Her face, apparently with
eyes closed, is pointed down; her long hair cascades over her
neck and down behind her head.  Above her and to the right, an
extremely contracted figure sits among rocks.  This is probably
Theotormon, Oothoon's ineffectual lover.  His legs appear to be
crossed, with the left foot prominently poised below his heavy
knees.  He faces down so that we see only the top of his head,
covered with curly hair.  His arms are wrapped around his head,
with the left arm bent at the elbow and his left hand, formed
into a fist, perhaps clutching his curly hair.  His right arm
descends along the right side of his hidden face and disappears
beneath his left elbow.  The design may illustrate the following
lines on Plate 5: "Bound back to back in Bromions caves terror &amp;
meekness dwell / At entrance Theotormon sits wearing the
threshold hard" (line 7-8).  Given this textual parallel, the two
figures on the left may be personifications of terror (note the
expression on Bromion's face) and meekness.</illusobjdesc><component type="object" location="E"><characteristic>cave</characteristic><characteristic>stone</characteristic><characteristic>sand</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The three figures are situated within the mouth of a

the right with her arms crossed in front of her and her hands
over her breasts.  Her hair appears to be drawn back in a bun,
yet a few strands of long hair curl down her back.  She appears
to be kissing a much smaller (apparently female) figure, although this "kiss" is less clear than in other copies because the smaller figure's had does not appear to be bent back.  This
second nude figure is seen from behind; her arms are extended
horizontally.  Her right foot is poised just above one of the two
flowers, probably marigolds, growing on a plant lower right.  Her
left leg is bent at the knee in a dance-like posture.  She seems
to hover in the air.  The kneeling figure is probably Oothoon,
the smaller figure probably the "nymph" who personifies the
marigold.  As the text on Plate 4 explains, "Oothoon wandered in
woe, / Along the vales of Leutha seeking flowers to comfort her;
/ And thus she spoke to the brigth Marygold of Leutha's vale /
Art though a flower! art thou a nymph! I see thee now a flower; /
Now a nymph! (lines 5-9).  Given this textual point of contact, the
landscape is Leutha's Vale, also named in the text on this plate.
The hovering nymph may also be identified with Leutha (see
"Leutha's flower," Plate 3, line 7).  The flat land is colored as though
covered with grass.  Great shafts of radiance fill most of the
sky; they would seem to emanate from a sun just below the horizon
and perhaps in part from the marigolds.  Higher in the sky are
slight suggestions of clouds.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="CD"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>young</characteristic><characteristic>Oothoon</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>kneeling</characteristic><characteristic>kissing</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>bun</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent at knee</characteristic><characteristic>bending forward</characteristic><characteristic>hands on breasts</characteristic><characteristic>arms crossed</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A young nude woman kneels on the ground and leans to

probably female, sits on top of the first diagonal of the letter
"V."  She faces left, with her left knee bent and her right leg
extended below her. She holds in her left hand and to her mouth a
curved horn; she is very probably playing this musical
instrument.  To the right, just above the first "i," is a
billowing cloud with a long trailing edge.  On it sits a figure
who is probably female.  She shows slight indications of a gown
or drapery, but may be unclothed in this copy.  She sits on the
cloud side-saddle, as though it were a horse.  Her legs are
crossed and her head rests on her left hand-a posture
traditionally associated with melancholy.  Further to the right
are two energetic male nudes.  Both hover in the air with their
legs extended and their bodies twisted.  The male above the
letters "o" and "n" draws his bow, held in his right hand with
the bowstring pulled back by his left hand.  The arrow, pointed
down and to the left, has not yet been released.  His companion
to the right holds his bow below him in his right hand.  Neither
a bowstring nor an arrow are pictured; perhaps he has just
released the latter.  His left arm is bent and appears to reach
behind his head; perhaps he is reaching for another arrow (not
pictured).  Below the final letter of the heading is a hovering
figure, very probably female.  The long hem of her gown trails
off to the top right in several snake-like curves.  She faces to
the left, with at least one arm extended horizontally.  She may

One figure,
probably male, is seated on the sand or stones near the water.
He wears a long gown that covers all but his head, hands, and
prominent right foot.  We see him from the front; his knees are
drawn up to his upper chest in a very contracted posture.  Given
the position of his right foot, his legs are probably crossed at
the ankles.  His hands rest upon his knees, and in turn his head
is bent forward and rests upon his hands.  We see only the top of
his head, covered with curly hair.  This is probably Theotormon,
"weeping" (Plate 5, line 23) near "the margind ocean" (Plate 11, line 14).  
To the left is a giant wave, shaped like a tongue of flame.  Within this wave 
is a nude female, shackled and chained on her left ankle.  Her right leg is 
apparently extended behind her left.  She arches to the right, with her arms 
bent at the elbows and her hands clasped together just below her neck in a 
gesture that suggests prayer or supplication.  She faces down and apparently looks at the 
self-enclosed male below her.  Her long hair drifts behind her neck
and back.  She is very probably Oothoon, pleading to her lover.
Right and left of the wave in which she appears is a rocky cliff,
perhaps covered with vegetation such as lichens.  Wavy lines
along the lower margin of the design below both figures suggest
small waves of the sea.  Far right, slightly less than half the

back her [Oothoon's] sighs."  Three gowned female
figures-the Daughters of Albion-huddle together on the
seashore, lower right.  The right-most figure in the group has her
legs drawn up in a sitting or squatting position similar to her
companions.
She looks up and to the left at the figure hovering above.  Her
companion to the left also looks up and to the left.  Her right
leg is drawn up; her right arm is extended horizontally to the
right, with her right hand resting on her companion's left
shoulder.  The left-most figure in the group has both legs drawn
up and her head lowered; we see only the top of her head.  All
three females have long hair.  Above the group and to the left is
Oothoon, hovering in the air or on a cloud.  We see only her
unclothed chest, head facing forward, long hair streaming out on
both sides of her head, and long arms extended horizontally.  Her
hands seem to rest on or hold the cloud.  Flames emanate from
just below her chest and extend over both arms.  The cloud lower
left is dark; the sky on the right is dark and stormy.  Slight
washes in the text area extend the representation of the sky to
the top margin of the plate, thus converting the composition into
a full-plate design.  The sea, lower left, includes some
waves.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="D"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>Daughters of Albion</characteristic><characteristic>sitting</characteristic><characteristic>squatting</characteristic><characteristic>huddled</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>contracted</characteristic><characteristic>legs drawn up</characteristic><characteristic>knees</characteristic><characteristic>left foot</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>facing up</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><illusobjdesc>One of the Daughters of Albion huddles in a seated
