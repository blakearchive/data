               <seriesstmt>The William Blake Archive</seriesstmt>
               <updatestmt> The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of
                    electronic editions of our second installment of Blake's letters, the
                    correspondence of 1800-1805, which includes his three years with patron William
                    Hayley in the coastal village of Felpham, West Sussex, and the frightening
                    months leading up to his trial for sedition. <lb/> The letters in this group
                    supplement the Archive’s publication in November 2013 of Blake's illustrations
                    to works by Hayley, including his <hi rend="i">Essay on Sculpture</hi>, the
                    broadside ballad <hi rend="i">Little Tom the Sailor</hi>, <hi rend="i">The
                         Triumphs of Temper</hi>, <hi rend="i">The Life and Posthumous Writings of
                         William Cowper</hi>, and <hi rend="i">The Life of George Romney</hi>, along
                    with the republication of Blake’s etched and engraved illustrations to <hi
                         rend="i">Designs to a Series of Ballads, Written by William Hayley</hi>
                    (1802) and Hayley’s <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi> (1805). Letters from this period
                    track the downward spiral from the most hopeful moments of Blake’s anticipations
                    of working for the beloved “hermit of Eartham” to the bitterness and resentment
                    he ultimately felt for that “pickthank.” The letters also show Blake in the
                    process of conducting routine business: with Hayley but also with his important
                    London patron Thomas Butts and with the publisher-promoter Robert Hartley
                    Cromek, who was destined to become a focus of anger and frustration in the next
                    stage of Blake’s life. <lb/><lb/> About ninety of Blake’s letters survive, an
                    unknown fraction of the total. Several—ten in the present group of
                    thirty-three—are known only from partial and full transcriptions in the second,
                    expanded, edition of Alexander Gilchrist’s <hi rend="i">Life of William
                         Blake</hi> (1880). Blake traveled seldom and not very far. His circle of
                    correspondents was narrow and the geographical circuit small. But his modest
                    body of correspondence comprises an absorbing, revealing miscellany of reports
                    on work in progress alongside friendly and not so friendly exchanges on matters
                    of practical and intellectual substance. Occasionally the letters burst out into
                    visions that amalgamate, in a characteristic Blakean vein, homely details,
                    intensely energized prose, and inspired poetry.&#160; <lb/><lb/> The letters
                    are, in any case, indispensable in preserving facts and contexts for his life
                    and work that would be otherwise unknown and in showing him shift pragmatically
                    from role to role in a very natural—and human—way, exposing facets of character
                    and personality not always so apparent in his art. The letters feel closer to
                    the exigencies of everyday life than any other works from Blake’s hand. He
                    seldom puts pen to paper without interesting consequences for readers.
                    <lb/><lb/> The Archive now contains 136 fully searchable and scalable electronic
                    editions of important manuscripts and series of engravings, color printed
                    drawings, tempera paintings, water color drawings, including 90 copies of
                    Blake's nineteen illuminated books—all in the context of full bibliographic
                    information about each work, careful diplomatic transcriptions of all texts,
                    detailed descriptions of all images, and extensive bibliographies. <lb/><lb/> As
                    always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access
                    restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible by the
