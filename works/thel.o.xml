                                    The editors of the Blake Archive are pleased to announce that Copies F, H, and O of <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> and Copies a, C, and J of <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> are now publicly accessible. The images are linked to enlargements and to transcriptions edited to correspond to the particular copy; plates are displayed in the order they appear in the copy and are identified by that order, as well as by their Bentley, Erdman, and Keynes plate numbers.<lb/><lb/>
                                    The source of the digital images are new 4x5 color transparencies, which were color corrected against the originals. They were scaled to the size of the originals and scanned in 24-bit color at 300dpi. The resulting digital images, which were color corrected against the transparencies, are displayed as jpeg images, at 100dpi and at 300dpi. The former image will be displayed larger or smaller than the original depending on your monitor's resolution. In the near future, though, using a program being developed by the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities , you will be able to receive these images resized on the fly according to your monitor's resolution.<lb/><lb/>
                                    We will continue to make copies of illuminated books accessible once we have scanned and color corrected the images and edited the texts. In the next few months, we will display <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> Copy D, <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> Copy G, <hi rend="i">Song of Los</hi> Copy B, <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> Copies B and E, and <hi rend="i">America</hi> Copy E. We will also post a general bibliography on Blake and select bibliographies for each of these books, as well as Erdman's edition of Blake's poetry and prose. Users will thus be able to browse the Archive, downloading images and texts (for private use only). When the search engine is operational, they will also be able to search the Archive for words, visual motifs, or bibliographical information, because we are also encoding all texts, plates, and images in Standard General Markup Language (see Plan of the Archive).<lb/><lb/>
                                    We presently have over 1200 transparencies of a projected 3000 for the Archive. With the entire Rosenwald Collection of illuminated books and the Essick Collection of prints, as well as works from the Glasgow University Library and the New York Public Library, we have at least one copy of every illuminated book, major series of prints (<hi rend="i">Book of Job</hi>, Dante illustrations, <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi>, etc.), and commercial engraving. We will be adding paintings and manuscripts as we add other important collections to the Archive. Scanning, editing, and encoding all of these images will keep the site under construction for the next few years.<lb/><lb/>
                                    Users can visit this page for future updates about our progress and about future developments at the Institute that affect the Archive, such as INOTE (written in the programming language Java), a tool that makes it possible for users to search, enlarge, compare, and annotate images.

protectively over the title words and major pictorial motifs.  This
combination of motifs and their position suggests a tombstone.  Two
birds and a human figure soar in the sky; seven other human forms,
one winged, rest or climb among the title letters.  Thel, wearing a
long gown and holding a shepherd's crook, stands lower left and gazes at
a nude man embracing a gowned woman around her waist.  She raises her
arms.  These figures seem to emerge from the large, bowl-like
flowers lower center and right.  The leaves of this plant and a flower bud
complete the design lower center and right. The design does not
directly illustrate a scene in the text, but the figures embracing above the
flowers may suggest the "raptures" (Plate 4 [5], line 13) of the Cloud and 
the "fair eyed dew" (Plate 4 [5], line 15) during their courtship. </illusobjdesc><component type="vegetation" location="E"><characteristic>tree</characteristic><characteristic>willow</characteristic><characteristic>tombstone</characteristic><characteristic>arching</characteristic><characteristic>branch</characteristic><characteristic>leaf</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A large, willow-like tree arches over the title words

a nude man reaching toward a large eagle, a nude man holding a sword
and shield, and a gowned woman holding a small child in her
outstretched arms.  Below, a fifth figure, a nude man, rests on the branch of a tree (or perhaps
a tassel of grain) and looks up toward the child.  Spiraling vines
and stylized flowers, perhaps lilies, spring from several of the title
letters. A tree grows up the far left margin; a few spiky lines at 
the bottom of the plate probably delineate grass or some other sort
of low vegetation.  Blake's coloring of this impression converts
this  text plate into a full-page design.  The design does not represent
any specific incident in the text, but the man with shield and spear
may be one of the "thousand fighting men" referred to near

the personified Worm and Clod (or "matron Clay" [line 15]).  Her long hair
cascades
over her shoulders; the hem of her long gown billows around her. 
The infant Worm extends both arms and looks at the Clod, a young, nude
woman lying on the ground.  She may be reaching for her offspring.
Right of Thel is a large plant with spiky leaves and two blossoms,
one of which arches over Thel's head.  Left of Thel is another plant
with similar leaves but no blossoms.  Blake has added water on the left
and in the foreground, suggesting a river or lake.  Given this
configuration, the figures may be on an island or peninsula.  A
cliff or edge of a tree trunk rises along the left margin.  Washes
beneath and on all sides of the text may indicate clouds.  Blake's coloring
of this impression converts this text plate into a full-page
design.  
The design may in part illustrate lines on the 
previous plate: "The Clod of Clay heard the Worms voice, &amp; raisd her pitying head; / She bow'd over the weeping infant..."
