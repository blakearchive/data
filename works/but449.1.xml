      <updatestmt>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of 20 of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible. These designs illustrate the Old Testament and are arranged according to the passages illustrated.  They are presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).
            
        <lb/>
        <lb/>
        The Bible had an enormous influence on Blake’s work as both artist and poet.  Among his many and complex responses to that text are water color drawings.  The present group of 20 is selected from a sequence of about 80 biblical water colors of similar size Blake painted for Thomas Butts between c. 1800 and c. 1806.  These designs emphasize interactions between the human and the divine.  In works such as 
        <hi rend="i">Ezekiel’s Wheels</hi>
        and 
        <hi rend="i">David Delivered Out of Many Waters</hi>
        , the interaction is revelatory or redemptive.  In other designs, including 
        <hi rend="i">Pestilence: The Death of the First-Born</hi>
        , the relationship between God and humankind devolves into punishment and destruction.
            
        <lb/>
        <lb/>
        This group of 20 water colors is the first installment in our publication of a large selection of Blake’s water color drawings illustrating the Bible.  In coming months we will publish a group of New Testament illustrations also from the series executed for Butts.  Later we will add early works, such as 
        <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>
        , datable to c. 1780, and continue through Blake’s final biblical water colors, including 
        <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi>
        of c. 1824.

        <illustration location="E" type="plate">
          <illusobjdesc>This water colour illustrates Deuteronomy 34:6 and Jude 9. In the bottom center of this design lies a gowned male on, and partially wrapped in, a shroud, cloth or blanket. He faces up and has long hair and a beard, and so appears to be old. His eyes are closed though his mouth may be slightly open. His right arm is at his side. His feet are visible. He presumably is Moses and is dead. The blanket or cloth that Moses's body lies on is held, suspended, by four angels. The two angels on the left of the design both appear to be males. They both have short, curly hair and wings, and wear gowns. Each of these angels looks down and to right, presumably at Moses. The right foot of angel on the left of the design is visible. The two angels on the right of the design are both gowned and have wings. They both bend forward and face left, as though looking at Moses. The leftmost angel of this pair has curly hair and the rightmost one has long, flame-like hair. The left foot of this angel is visible. Both of these angels may be male. The angels that hold Moses's body stand on a patch of bare earth with an open grave. There may be some vegetation above the grave and below the shroud. 
  In the (cloudy?) sky above Moses and the angels hover two figures: the Devil and an angel. The Devil is on the left of the design, faces forward and slightly right, though his head is twisted so that he looks upward as well. He has batlike wings and his mouth is open. He may be speaking. His arms are bent at his sides so that his clenched fists are visible. His legs are bent and extended backward. Around the Devil's head are five streaks of fire or bolts of lightning.  Similar motifs are pictured around his feet. The angel to the right faces left, as though looking at the Devil to the left. He has short, curly hair and wears a gown, the hem of which swirls as though to indicate rapid movement. He has wings and raises his left arm at 135 degrees, bending it upward and pointing upward with his index finger. The landscape behind the body of Moses may be comprised of two large boulders.
