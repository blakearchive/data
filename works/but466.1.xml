            <updatestmt>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an
                electronic edition of 20 of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible. These
                designs illustrate the Old Testament and are arranged according to the passages
                illustrated. They are presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the
                features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed
                descriptions of Blake’s images). 
                <lb/>
                <lb/>
                The Bible had an enormous influence on Blake’s work as both artist and poet.
                Among his many and complex responses to that text are water color drawings. The
                present group of 20 is selected from a sequence of about 80 biblical water colors of
                similar size Blake painted for Thomas Butts between c. 1800 and c 1806. These
                designs emphasize interactions between the human and the divine. In works such as
                    
                <hi rend="i">Ezekiel’s Wheels</hi>
                and 
                <hi rend="i">David Delivered Out of Many
                    Waters</hi>
                , the interaction is revelatory or redemptive. In other designs,
                including 
                <hi rend="i">Pestilence: The Death of the First-Born</hi>
                , the
                relationship between God and humankind devolves into punishment and destruction. 
                <lb/>
                <lb/>
                This group of 20 water colors is the first installment in our publication of a
                large selection of Blake’s water color drawings illustrating the Bible. In coming
                months we will publish a group of New Testament illustrations also from the series
                executed for Butts. Later we will add early works, such as 
                <hi rend="i">Abraham and
                    Isaac</hi>
                , datable to c. 1780, and continue through Blake’s final biblical
                water colors, including 
                <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi>
                of c. 1824.

                        Blake's biblical water colors. If once present, such an inscription was
                        trimmed off the mount at an unknown time.</role></origination>

                <illustration location="E" type="plate">
                    <illusobjdesc>This design illustrates Psalms 137:1-3. In the center of the
                        design sits a group of enslaved Israelites, perhaps a family, beneath a
                        tree. The rightmost figure is an old man with long hair and a beard. He
                        wears a gown and faces forward, with his knees drawn up and his arms
                        crossed. He looks to the left at his captors. He has a shackle on his left
                        ankle. His facial expression suggests despair. The second-to-right figure of
                        this group is that of a gowned male(?) with short, curly hair. He faces left
                        and draws his knees up. He holds his head in his hands and hides his face.
                        His posture suggests despair. He also has a shackle on his left ankle; a
                        chain extends to the shackle on the ankle of the old man to the right. The
                        third-to-right figure of this group is a female with long hair. She faces
                        forward and to the left and may have her mouth slightly open. In her right
                        hand, she holds an infant. The the next figure to the left in this group is
                        an infant who faces forward, right, and slightly up. Its gender is
                        indeterminable. Its eyes are closed and it may be sleeping. The
                        third-to-left figure of this group is a gowned male child with short, curly
                        hair. He stands facing forward, but leaning against the female who may be
                        his mother. He turns his head up and to the right to look at her. His right
                        hand rests on the shoulder of the figure to the left, perhaps his sister.
                        The second-to-left figure is that of a young girl with long, slightly curly
                        hair and a gown. She stands, facing forward and slightly right. She leans
                        against the male figure to her right and rests her head on his shoulder; her
                        right arm is at her side and with her right hand she holds the neck of the
                        figure to the left. The leftmost figure of this group is that of a young
                        male with short, curly hair. He sits or crouches with his left leg bent
                        under him and his right leg drawn up and perhaps on tiptoe. He faces forward
                        and to the right and looks upward. He wears a gown. On the right side of the
                        design stand two partly clothed male figures with short, curly hair; they
                        are probably enslaved Israelites. The figure to the left wears a loincloth
                        and faces forward and to the left, leaning against a long oar that he holds.
                        His right ankle has a shackle on it and he bends his right leg so that it is
                        on tiptoe. His arms are bent upward and he may be looking at the seated
                        group to the left. The figure to the right also bends his right leg and
                        faces forward and to the left, looking slightly down. He leans against an
                        oar that he holds in his right hand. On the left side of the design stands a
                        group of five figures, presumably the victorious Babylonians. The leftmost
                        figure is that of a male with long, curly hair and a beard. He faces right
                        and slightly forward and probably wears a gown. He may look at the seated
                        group of Israelites. Only the long hair of the next figure to the right is
                        pictured. The middle figure of this group is an old man with a long beard
                        and curly hair. He is presumably a king because he wears a spiky crown on
                        his head. He faces right and slightly forward and may look at the seated
                        group of Israelites. He wears a gown and holds his right arm at his side, in
                        which hand he holds a scepter topped with what appears to be a fleur-de-lis.
                        The second-to-right figure of this group is that of an armored male with
                        short, curly hair. He faces forward and right. The armor around his waist
                        resembles scales and he wears a crown of laurel leaves in his hair. He may
                        be a soldier. He may look at the group of seated Israelites. His left arm is
                        at his side and with that hand he holds the right hand of the figure to the
                        right. The rightmost figure of this group is that of a female in an
                        elaborate gown and with a plumed hat draped with pearls or beads. She also
                        wears long pearl or bead earrings and a pearl or bead bracelet. She has
                        long, curly hair that is slightly pulled up into a bun. She faces forward
                        and to the right and looks down at the seated group of Israelites. With her
                        right hand she holds the left hand of the figure to the left. Her left arm
                        is raised at 135 degrees and with her left hand she points at the musical
                        instruments in the tree. The armored Babylonian male holds a spear and at
                        least three spears are visible to the left. The central group of Israelites
                        sits beneath a tree (identified in psalm 137 as a willow) with long
                        branches. On the branches of the tree are hung a lyre, a curved horn, a
                        straight horn, and a harp. In the foreground of the scene are waves,
                        indicating the rivers of Babylon. A river winds through the background. The
                        ground beneath the figures' feet is grassy. To the right of the Babylonian
                        woman are three small figures standing in the background on the bank of the
                        river, facing away and to the right. Their legs are spread as they stand on
                        the river bank, perhaps walking or running. Six boats are visible on the
                        river in the background, most with sails but at least one appears to be a
                        barge. The city of Babylon is visible in the background, built along the
                        riverbanks. Most buildings have columns and several have domes, though at
                        least one spire is visible. In the background of the scene, a hill rises
                        from the river. The riverbanks are marked by indeterminate, leafy
                        vegetation.</illusobjdesc>

                            draped with pearls or beads. She also wears long pearl or bead earrings
                            and a pearl or bead bracelet. She has long, curly hair that is slightly
                            pulled up into a bun. She faces forward and to the right and looks down
                            at the seated group of Israelites. With her right hand she holds the
                            left hand of the figure to the left. Her left arm is raised at 135
                            degrees and with her left hand she points at the musical instruments in
                            the tree. She wears a sandal on her visible (right) foot.</illusobjdesc>
