            The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of 20 of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible. These designs illustrate the Old Testament and are arranged according to the passages illustrated.  They are presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).
            <lb/><lb/>
            The Bible had an enormous influence on Blake’s work as both artist and poet.  Among his many and complex responses to that text are water color drawings.  The present group of 20 is selected from a sequence of about 80 biblical water colors of similar size Blake painted for Thomas Butts between c. 1800 and 1805.  These designs emphasize interactions between the human and the divine.  In works such as <hi rend="i">Ezekiel’s Wheels</hi> and <hi rend="i">David Delivered Out of Many Waters</hi>, the interaction is revelatory or redemptive.  In other designs, including <hi rend="i">Pestilence: The Death of the First-Born</hi>, the relationship between God and humankind devolves into punishment and destruction.
            <lb/><lb/>
            This group of 20 water colors is the first installment in our publication of a large selection of Blake’s water color drawings illustrating the Bible.  In coming months we will publish a group of New Testament illustrations also from the series executed for Butts.  Later we will add early works, such as <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>, datable to c. 1780, and continue through Blake’s final biblical water colors, including <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi> of c. 1824.
            <lb/><lb/>

Pharaoh's daughter occupies the center of the design, facing left and slightly forward. She bends forward and looks down at the baby Moses. She wears a gown and has long, curly hair. Her arms are at her side, though bent slightly and with her palms down. Her legs are also bent slightly. She wears a crown on her head and her mouth may be slightly open. To either side of Pharaoh's daughter stand two children, both apparently female with long hair. The child to the left faces left and slightly forward, and bends down to look at Moses. She may be gowned. Her right arm is bent upward, with her palm out. She may be smiling. The child to the right is nude and faces left and down slightly to look at Moses. Her left arm is at her side and her left leg is bent and on tiptoe. To the right of Pharaoh's daughter stand two gowned women, perhaps servants, with long, curly hair. The figure to the left stands, facing forward and slightly left. She bends her head down slightly to look at Moses. Her left arm is at her side. In her left hand she holds a jar or a large vial. Her right arm is bent upward, and she seems to be touching or holding her hair with her right hand. She may be smiling. The figure to the right stands in profile, facing left and looking down at Moses. Her left arm is bent over her chest. To the left of Pharaoh's daughter is Moses. He lies in a wicker basket containing a pillow and blanket. Moses is an infant, nude with short, curly hair. His legs are spread, with his right leg bent under him and his left leg extended forward. His genitals are pictured. His arms are raised at 135 degrees and he faces forward, looking at the woman to his left. To the left of Moses are two gowned female figures. The figure to the far left may be a child, with long hair, who stands facing right. She bends forward at the waist with her arms at her side to look at Moses. The figure to the right is an adult, whose hair is partly covered with a veil or cloth of some sort. She kneels, bending forward, to look at Moses. Her mouth may be slightly open. Her left arm is bent and raised at 45 degrees; with it, she lifts Moses out of his basket. Her right arm is at her side, but bent; her right hand holds her exposed breast. 
       On the lower right corner of the design, a heron or stork stands facing right and bending forward. In its beak it holds a fish, which it is feeding to its chicks, of which there are at least five with upturned beaks, facing left, right, and away. An inlet of the river Nile is in the foreground. The river contains flowering lily pads, reeds with catkins, and long grass. The ground under the figures' feet appears to be grassy and has indeterminate and, at points, flowering vegetation. Three palm trees with rough trunks are in the middle distance, one behind Pharaoh's daughter, one between the rightmost servants, and one on the right margin. Clusters of dates are visible toward the tops of the trunks. In the background, two large pyramids are visible. The ground in the background appears to be sandy.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>Pharaoh's daughter</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>bending forward</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>facing down</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>crown</characteristic><characteristic>mouth open</characteristic><characteristic>arms at side</characteristic><characteristic>arms bent</characteristic><characteristic>palms down</characteristic><characteristic>legs bent</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Pharaoh's daughter stands in the center of the design, facing left and slightly forward.
