                The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> Copy H, in the Rosenbach Museum and Library, and the republication in full searchable mode of Blake’s sixteen engravings in John Gabriel Stedman’s <hi rend="i">Narrative, of a Five Years’ Expedition, against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam</hi> (1796). We are presenting two versions of these plates, one with the designs uncolored and one with the designs hand colored. 
                <lb/><lb/><hi rend="i">Visions</hi>, extant in eighteen complete copies, consists of eleven relief-etched plates executed and first printed in 1793. Copy H was produced in Blake's first printing session and joins Copies a, A, B, C, E, I, and J (1793), F (c. 1794), G (1795), and O and P (c. 1818), previously published in the Archive. Probably to lend variety to his stock of copies on hand, Blake used three ink colors in this first printing: yellow ochre (as in Copy A), raw sienna (Copies B, C, and E), and green (Copies H, I, and J). Like all early copies of <hi rend="i">Visions</hi>, Copy H has the frontispiece printed on one side of a leaf, but all other plates are printed on both sides of five leaves. In Copy H, the embossments of the platemarks into the leaves can be seen from both sides of the leaves. Examples of the full leaves for Plates 2 and 10, included as Supplemental Views in the Show Me menu, lower left under the plate images, show how the plates were registered to the leaves. 
                <lb/><lb/>
                Blake began work on the Stedman plates in 1791. Stedman visited Blake in June 1794 and subsequently the engraver helped the author with various business matters, very probably including negotiations with the book's publisher, Joseph Johnson. Blake's attitudes towards slavery and colonialism were indebted to Stedman's autobiographical narrative, as is particularly evident in the texts and designs of his illuminated books <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> and <hi rend="i">America</hi>, both dated 1793. Stedman's relationship with a female slave, Joanna, may have influenced Blake's complex representations of gender and sexuality.
                <lb/><lb/>
                With the publication of <hi rend="i">Visions</hi> Copy H, the Archive now contains fully searchable and scalable electronic editions of 87 copies of Blake's nineteen illuminated books in the context of full bibliographic information about each work, careful diplomatic transcriptions of all texts, detailed descriptions of all images, and extensive bibliographies. New protocols for transcription, which produce improved accuracy and fuller documentation in editors' notes, have been applied to all copies of <hi rend="i">Visions</hi> in the Archive. With the Archive's Compare feature, users can easily juxtapose multiple impressions of any plate across the different copies of this or any of the other illuminated books and, with the Virtual Lightbox, users can examine images from any genre side by side, as well as crop, zoom, and juxtapose them for close study.               
                <lb/><lb/>
                In addition to illuminated books, the Archive contains many important manuscripts and series of engravings, sketches, and water color drawings, including illustrations to Thomas Gray's <hi rend="i">Poems</hi>, water color and engraved illustrations to Dante's <hi rend="i">Divine Comedy</hi>, the large color printed drawings of 1795 and c. 1805, the Linnell and Butts sets of the <hi rend="i">Book of Job</hi> water colors and the sketchbook containing drawings for the engraved illustrations to the <hi rend="i">Book of Job</hi>, the water color illustrations to Robert Blair's <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, and all nine of Blake's water color series illustrating the poetry of John Milton.

 The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of Blake's sixteen engravings in John Gabriel Stedman's <hi rend="i">Narrative, of a Five Years' Expedition, against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam</hi> (1796).  We are presenting two versions of these plates, one with the designs uncolored and one with the designs hand colored.  These commercial copy engravings are presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (our image annotation program).<lb/><lb/>           
           Stedman's <hi rend="i">Narrative</hi> contains a frontispiece to volume 1, an engraved vignette on the title page of each of the two volumes, and eighty numbered full-page plates (including three maps).  Thirteen of the numbered plates are signed by Blake; a further three unsigned plates (7, 12, and 14) have been attributed to Blake by modern scholars.  As both title pages indicate, the full-page plates are based on drawings by Stedman.  None of the drawings on which Blake based his engravings has been traced, but it is likely that Blake made various minor alterations in Stedman's amateur designs.<lb/><lb/>               
               Blake began work on the Stedman plates in 1791.  Stedman visited Blake in June 1794, and subsequently the engraver helped the author with various business matters, very probably including negotiations with the book's publisher, Joseph Johnson.  Blake's attitudes towards slavery and colonialism were indebted to Stedman's autobiographical narrative, as is particularly evident in the texts and designs of his illuminated books <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> and <hi rend="i">America</hi>, both dated 1793.  Stedman's relationship with a female slave, Joanna, may have influenced Blake's complex representations of gender and sexuality.<lb/><lb/>                  
                  Most, possibly all, of the large-paper copies issued in 1796 have hand-colored plates that include touches of liquefied gold and silver.  This tinting was very probably executed by anonymous commercial colorists hired by Johnson.  A second edition was issued in 1806 and reprinted in 1813.  Some copies of these two later issues also have hand-colored plates, but in a style different from the 1796 coloring.<lb/><lb/>

               A young Marine stands prominently in the center of the illustration. He wears military attire. With his right leg slightly forward, he stands as he looks forward and slightly to the left. His left arm is bent, with his left fist on his hip. His right arm is extended to hold his rifle, topped with a bayonet. He wears boots along with breeches (with buttons and bows at the knee) and stockings. His sheathed sword is fastened on his left hip. He wears a belted purse around his waist. A pistol is tucked into his belt (to the right of the purse). A roll of cloth, probably a hammock, is draped over his left shoulder and crosses his chest. Underneath the hammock, there is a knapsack that is slung over his right shoulder.  He wears a ruffled shirt under his military jacket. He wears a cap that holds a leafy twig on the left and a sprig of vegetation on the right. He casts shadows to the right.

         A large, partly barren tree takes up the left margin of the design. Three monkeys, one with a baby clinging to its back, are climbing in the tree. A fifth monkey leaps towards a smaller tree in the lower right corner of the design. The trees along with additional leafy vegetation adorn the river bank. A figure is rowing a boat to the left, and in the middle distance (across the river), there is additional vegetation. In the far distance (near the right margin), a rocky mountain is visible.

Another monkey leaps from the large tree to a smaller one, lower right. Stedman distinguishes two species of monkeys by describing the Mecoo monkey as having "a black head" and a "very long tail," whereas the Kishee-Kishee monkey has a "milk white face with a black patch in the middle" and a tail that is "black at the extremity." By using Stedman's identifiers, it seems likely that the two monkeys occupying the top section of the large tree are Mecoo monkeys and that the three monkeys occupying the bottom section of the illustration are Kishee Kishee monkeys. The uppermost Mecoo monkey sits slightly upright, although hunched forward. It looks directly at the viewer. Its feet grip the branch to support it as its tail wraps around a branch to anchor its body. Its right paw rests upon its right knee, while its left paw is near its face. The second Mecoo monkey is below and slightly to the right of the sitting monkey in the treetop. The second monkey faces to the left, while holding onto the branch with all of its paws. Both Mecoo monkeys have furry bodies with long tails and appear to be looking toward the viewer. Darker fur circumscribes their faces. In the middle of the illustration, an adult Kishee Kishee monkey clings to a vine dangling from the large tree. All four paws grip the vine as it faces to the right. On the back of this Kishee Kishee monkey is a baby Kishee monkey, which clings with its entire body and wraps its tail around the adult monkey. The baby looks to the right, while slightly towards the viewer. A third Kishee Kishee monkey leaps from the larger tree towards the smaller tree. As it leaps the front paws are extended slightly forward, while its back legs are fully extended back along with its tail.</illusobjdesc></component><component location="D" type="vegetation"><characteristic>tree</characteristic><characteristic>leaf</characteristic><characteristic>leafless</characteristic><characteristic>branch</characteristic><characteristic>trunk</characteristic><illusobjdesc>
