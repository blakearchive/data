            The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the republication of electronic editions of the Thomas Butts and John Linnell series of Blake’s water color illustrations of the <hi rend="i">Book of Job</hi> and the sketchbook of preliminary pencil drawings for his <hi rend="i">Job</hi> engravings.  These three series were previously published in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).  With this republication, those functions now become available, along with our new Related Works feature giving access to related materials through active links on the work index pages and the Show Me menu on the object view pages.  Blake’s <hi rend="i">Job</hi> engravings have been previously published with Image Search and Inote capabilities.  
            <lb/><lb/>
            With this republication, the Archive now includes fully searchable reproductions of all four series of <hi rend="i">Job</hi> designs, among Blake’s greatest achievements as a visual artist.  Thus, characters pictured in the designs, such as Bildad, Eliphaz, and of course Job’s wife, can be searched and located in all four series.  The Archive’s Image Search menu also includes a great many lesser motifs, figure types, postures and gestures.  In coming months, we will publish similarly updated versions of other works presently in Preview mode, including Blake’s nine series of water colors illustrating the poetry of John Milton.
            <lb/><lb/>
            The Archive recently added a new set of scholarly tools that should prove particularly useful when studying Blake’s <hi rend="i">Job</hi> designs.  These tools, known collectively as our Related Works system, are designed to show relationships among works and individual objects in the Archive. They function at two levels.  First, work index pages now include active links to related materials in the Archive.  Thus, researchers can move easily from any given <hi rend="i">Job</hi> series to any other series.  Second, the Show Me menu on object view pages now includes Related Works in the Archive.  Like the work-level menu, this list includes active links to related designs and is meant to allow study of the related materials side by side.  For example, researchers can move quickly from Blake’s engraving of Behemoth and Leviathan to its drawing in the sketchbook and study how Blake developed his design from preliminary sketch to finished engraving.

            As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.

            September 2006:
            <lb/><lb/>
            The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of electronic editions of the Linnell set of Blake's water color illustrations to The Book of Job and the sketchbook containing Blake's reduced drawings preparatory for the Job engravings. The sketchbook is reproduced complete and in color for the first time. These two important sets of Job illustrations join the Butts set of water colors and the engravings, both previously published in the Archive. Thus, the Archive now includes all four series of Job illustrations. The engravings are fully searchable. The Linnell set of water colors and the sketchbook are presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (our image annotation program).<lb/><lb/>
            Blake's pictorial engagements with The Book of Job extended over many decades. His first efforts were a small group of wash drawings of the mid-1780s showing Job in his misery with his wife and three friends. Another version of this subject appears among the emblem series that Blake sketched in his Notebook, but the composition appearing in the wash drawings culminated in the large intaglio etching/engraving, "Job," which Blake listed in his advertisement <hi rend="i">To the Public</hi> of 10 October 1793. This print may have stimulated Blake's chief patron, Thomas Butts, to commission a tempera painting, <hi rend="i">Job and His Daughters</hi>, c. 1799-1800 and, about six years later, a series of nineteen water colors illustrating the story of Job (the so-called "Butts set"). In 1821, Blake and his new patron John Linnell borrowed the water colors from Butts. Linnell traced the series and Blake colored them (the so-called "Linnell set"). Blake also added two more compositions to this later group and added versions of these same compositions to the earlier group, so that both sets now have twenty-one designs. The Linnell set led directly to his commission for the engravings. These began as a series of reduced sketches executed in 1823; the engravings themselves, with a title page added, were not finished and published until 1826.<lb/><lb/>

hovers, striding vigorously to the left, in flames.  Also in the fire are the faces of Job and his wife.  Four angels hover on the left side of the group; one deposits a book before God's throne-like chair, while another holds an open book.

lower portion of the design.  Her right hand is on her breast as 
she leans toward her husband.  Her left hand holds his right upper arm.  
Job holds a rectangular object, probably half a loaf of bread, in his 
right hand.  With his left hand he gives a similar half-loaf to an old 
man with a crutch and a dog on a leash.  Behind the recipient of Job's 
charity is a winged angel.  Another winged angel hovers on the left.  The near foreground is grassy.  
The middle distance contains grassy hills and the outlines of what are probably bushes or trees.  
On the left is a structure suggestive of a Druid trilithon, except that it has three rather 
than two columns. Beside this structure is what appears to be a fragment of another pillar, 
indicative of ruins. The horizon is defined by distant mountains with clouds above.  The upper portion portrays several dramatic figures, particularly 
Satan.  
He is nude. Flames ascend to the right 
from behind Satan's extended legs and right hand. The flames below his left arm and hand point downward.  He holds a vial in his right hand from which a liquid(?), perhaps 
indicative of pestilence, descends on Job.  On the left, nine(?) figures hover among flames, probably angels 
although without wings.  On the right nine(?) more angels are similarly arranged in the ascending flames.  
Smoke, or perhaps clouds, encircle Satan and these angelic figures.  In the center of this oval composition, God sits on a 
stone throne, raised on a plinth.  He faces forward, with his head turned to the right and slightly down, holding a book 
in his right hand and a scroll in his left.  An oval of radiance surrounds his head and upper body. </illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="CD"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>gowned</characteristic><characteristic>Job</characteristic><characteristic>old</characteristic><characteristic>sitting</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>legs crossed</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>lap</characteristic><characteristic>fingers</characteristic><characteristic>right foot</characteristic><characteristic>hem</characteristic><characteristic>arm on lap</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised horizontally</characteristic><characteristic>arms bent</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>giving</characteristic><illusobjdesc id="d0e4612">Job sits at the center in the lower half of the

                  nude above the waist; a piece of rough (burlap?) cloth covers his loins 
                  and legs.  His hands are down by his thighs, palms out.  The mottled textures

                  twisted toward her husband.  Her hair is long; her face now looks a good

                  sharply toward her chest, with both arms wrapped around them.  Her hands

                  gowned and point accusatory arms, hands, and fingers at Job.  The middle 
                  distance is filled with a low hill, perhaps covered with vegetation.  A bit of vegetation, 
                  probably grass, adorns the foreground.   A large pillar, or section of a wall, anchors the left

All are winged and partly nude, with indications of knee-length gowns or drapery; their arms overlap 
at 135 degree angles.  Inscriptions in the engraved version of this design indicate that these figures are probably personifications of stars.   
The middle section is anchored by the ancient figure of God kneeling in 
the center of the design.  His arms are outstretched horizontally.  
Beneath God's right arm is a youthful male riding (or possibly hovering above) one or more of the four horses beneath him.  
The halo or sun disc and the surrounding radiance suggest that he is a sun god, perhaps Apollo.  Beneath God's left arm is a winged female 
holding the reins of two serpents.  The crescent moon above her head 
identifies her as a moon goddess, probably Diana or Hecate.  Job and his 
wife sit or kneel in the lowest section of the design.  On the right are 
Job's three friends.  Given our identifications of the friends in Object 7, these are, from right to left, Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar.

playing horns; another young son playing a curled horn; a youthful

scroll (possibly another musical score) and perhaps singing; Job 
playing a large triangular harp; a young female playing a lyre; a son 
playing a curled horn and another playing a large harp; and a final 
youthful male holding a pipe, his mouth open, perhaps in song.  The 
instruments hung in the tree in the first scene of the drama are now 
used to praise God.  The great (oak?) tree from the opening scene again 
anchors the middle of the design; a sun appears over a distant mountain 
range on the right, and a crescent moon and one star (or planet) appear in 
the sky on the left.  Six sheep, including one ram, and a dog lie on
