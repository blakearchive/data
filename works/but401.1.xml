The scene takes place in a darkened stable, with visible roof beams made of wood. Straw covers the floor. Slightly to the left of center Jesus Christ hovers as a nude male infant. He has short hair and is surrounded by a glowing aura. His arms are raised horizontally with his palms up and his left leg bent slightly. Overall, his position recalls that of crucifixion. His mouth may be slightly open as he looks at the figure to the right. The baby Christ faces forward and slightly right. To the left of center kneels the Virgin Mary. She wears a long gown and her long, slightly curly hair cascades over her shoulders. Both feet are visible beneath the hem of her skirt and her right arm hangs at her side. Her head is bent back and her eyes are closed, almost as though she has fainted. Mary is supported by Joseph, the man standing behind her. He faces to the right with his head turned partly toward the viewer. He has curly hair and a beard. He wears a long gown with his right foot visible beneath the hem. His right leg is bent and his right arm is at his side and bent, as he leans forward to support Mary. To the right of center sits a woman with her legs bent, perhaps underneath her. This is St. Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist. She wears a long gown and a veil or scarf covers her hair. She faces to the left and looks at the baby Christ, both arms horizontal and hands outstretched, reaching toward Christ. Her mouth is open as she looks at Christ with an expression of awe. On Elizabeth's lap sits John the Baptist, a nude male child with short, curly hair. His legs are bent slightly and his arms are at his side but bent upward, with his hands to his mouth. His hands may be together in prayer. He faces left and may be looking at Jesus or at the Virgin Mary. On the right side of the image stand two cows or oxen, facing left and down. Each animal is horned. They appear to be eating from a wooden manger full of straw. At the top center of the image is a square window, which looks out onto the night sky and a radiance that may represent the star of Bethlehem.</illusobjdesc><component type="structure" location="E"><characteristic>stable</characteristic><characteristic>wood</characteristic><characteristic>dark</characteristic><characteristic>straw</characteristic><characteristic>roof</characteristic><characteristic>beam</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The scene takes place in a darkened stable, with visible roof beams made of wood.
