                        of the body of Cumberland's letter; see the note on Number of Leaves, below.
                        Object 1 has been reoriented vertically in the Object View Page, as would be
                        customary when reading the page.</note>

                        letter appears on the first recto (Object 1), first verso (Object 2), and
                        second recto (Object 3) of the folded sheet. The second verso is not
                        pictured. Below the end of Cumberland's letter to Blake on Object 3,
                        Cumberland added instructions to his son, also named George, to deliver the
                        letter and await Blake's response in person. Blake responded to Cumberland
                        the following day in a separate letter dated 19 December 1808 that is
                        available through the Index of Letters. The full sheet view of Objects 2 and
                        3 is available as a Supplemental View on the Object View Page for those
                        objects.</note>

                        3) of the folded sheet. The second verso is not pictured. Below the end of

                        letter dated 19 December 1808 that is available through the Index of
                        Letters. The full sheet view of objects 2 and 3 is available as a

                    <p>In the upper left corner an illegible stamp is visible. Along the upper right
                        edge, Cumberland has inscribed to his son, "Your Line d<hi
                            rend="superscript">r</hi> George is at the end of the Sheet", around
                        which a line division is drawn. Bentley (<hi rend="i">Writings</hi> volume
                        2, page 1642) reads "Sheet" as "Street" in this inscription. Below
                        Cumberland's inscription, "3/2" is inscribed in a darker ink in an unknown
                        hand.</p>

                    <p>The full sheet was folded to form two leaves. Cumberland's letter appears on
                        the first recto (Object 1), first verso (Object 2), and second recto (Object
                        3) of the folded sheet. The second verso is not pictured. Below the end of
                        Cumberland's letter to Blake on Object 3, Cumberland added instructions to
                        his son, also named George, to deliver the letter and await Blake's response
                        in person. Blake responded to Cumberland the following day in a separate
                        letter dated 19 December 1808 that is available through the Index of
                        Letters. The full sheet view of Objects 2 and 3 is available as a
                        Supplemental View on the Object View Page for those objects.</p>
                    <p>In the upper right corner "3/3" is inscribed in ink in an unknown hand. Below
                        Cumberland's signature, a line division is inscribed above Cumberland's
                        instructions to his son, also named George. The instructions read "Dear
