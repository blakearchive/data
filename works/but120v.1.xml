                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>The design illustrates Revelation 1:12-16, in which St. John the Evangelist sees a vision of Christ while exiled on the isle of Patmos. The island setting is indicated by a sandy ground in the lower half of the design, large rocks in the lower righthand and lower lefthand corners, some indeterminate vegetation in the shadowy region at lower left, and a body of water at left, behind John's back. In the lower half of the design, near the center, John kneels, facing forward and to the right. His long hair is gathered behind him, perhaps into a ponytail, and his face is partly covered by a short beard. John wears a long-sleeved gown with an additional piece of cloth draped around his back and over each knee. John's legs bend underneath him, though he does not quite sit on his heels; his bare right foot appears below the hem of his gown. His garments gather in piles on the ground. John leans forward over his knees with both arms bent and raised out in front of him. Though slightly staggered, his hands rise together with the palms facing one another and the fingers spread. John turns his head over his left shoulder, looking to the right and upward toward the vision of Christ that appears in the clouds above. John's cowering body position and open mouth suggest fear or awe. The Christ figure in the upper right quadrant of the design appears more faintly than John, and seems to be floating in the clouds above the ocean. Long-haired and bearded, Christ wears a long-sleeved gown that is secured by a belt at the waist and gathers in folds at his feet. He stands, facing forward and to the left, and leans slightly toward the left with his left knee bent inward. He may step forward with his left foot, though both feet are hidden by the gown. In customary fashion, Christ's arms are bent slightly and raised outward from his sides at approximately 45 degrees; his hands are open with his palms facing in front of him. His head turns toward the left, and he appears to gaze over John's head rather than at John himself. As described in Revelation 1:16, a sharp two-edged sword emerges from Christ's open mouth, extending downward and to the left. John's vision also contains at least two candlesticks (likely some of the seven candlesticks mentioned in Revelation 1:20), which appear at right of the Christ figure. The candlestick in front is approximately the same height as Christ's knee. It features a flat, circular base with decoration around the post at several levels. Lines extending upward above the candlestick suggest that it may hold a tall candle that nearly reaches Christ's left hand. A second candlestick appears faintly above and to the right of this one. John's vision appears among clouds of varying darkness. The cloud shape behind Christ is slightly darker than those immediately around it, and even darker clouds appear along the design's left and upper-left borders. Additional shadowy regions appear at John's back, below and to his left, and on the large stone in the lower righthand corner of the design.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>John's vision also contains at least two candlesticks (likely some of the seven candlesticks mentioned in Revelation 1:20), which appear at right of the Christ figure. The candlestick in front is approximately the same height as Christ's knee. It features a flat, circular base with decoration around the post at several levels. Lines extending upward above the candlestick suggest that it may hold a tall candle that nearly reaches Christ's left hand. A second candlestick appears faintly above and to the right of this one.</illusobjdesc>
