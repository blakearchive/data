      <seriesstmt>The William Blake Archive</seriesstmt>
      <updatestmt>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of 20 of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible. These designs illustrate the Old Testament and are arranged according to the passages illustrated.  They are presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).

        <lb/>
        The Bible had an enormous influence on Blake’s work as both artist and poet.  Among his many and complex responses to that text are water color drawings.  The present group of 20 is selected from a sequence of about 80 biblical water colors of similar size Blake painted for Thomas Butts between c. 1800 and 1805.  These designs emphasize interactions between the human and the divine.  In works such as 
        <hi rend="i">Ezekiel’s Wheels</hi>
        and 
        <hi rend="i">David Delivered Out of Many Waters</hi>
        , the interaction is revelatory or redemptive.  In other designs, including 
        <hi rend="i">Pestilence: The Death of the First-Born</hi>
        , the relationship between God and humankind devolves into punishment and destruction.
            
        <lb/>
        <lb/>
        This group of 20 water colors is the first installment in our publication of a large selection of Blake’s water color drawings illustrating the Bible.  In coming months we will publish a group of New Testament illustrations also from the series executed for Butts.  Later we will add early works, such as 
        <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>
        , datable to c. 1780, and continue through Blake’s final biblical water colors, including 
        <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi>
        of c. 1824.
            
        <lb/>

          <illusobjdesc>The design illustrates 1 Samuel 28:7-19. Dominating the center of the design is the figure of the ghost of Samuel, an old, gowned man with long hair and a beard. He stands, facing forward, but twisted to face left and look down at Saul. He is slightly hunched over and he holds his arms at his sides, with both hands pointing down. His feet appear to be beneath the floor or tomb cover. To the left of the ghost of Samuel kneels Saul, a male figure with short, curly hair. He wears a tights and appears to have a sandal on his right foot. His mouth is open and he bends backward slightly as he crouches, looking right and up at Samuel's ghost. Saul's arms are raised horizontally, though bent upward with fingers spread. Both of his legs are bent. To the left of Saul, two disembodied male faces are visible. The leftmost one has a beard and flame-like hair, and faces right, mouth open, presumably looking at Samuel's ghost. The rightmost figure has short, curly hair and faces right and slightly forward, mouth open, presumably looking at Samuel's ghost. To the right of Samuel's ghost sits or squats the Witch of Endor (see 1 Samuel 28:7) with flame-like hair, clothed by a toga-like gown. She faces left, with her knees drawn up and her mouth open. She may look at Saul. Her left arm is bent upward and partly wrapped around her head; her right arm is raised vertically, fingers spread. She sits on a flat stone, perhaps part of a tomb. This scene appears to take place in at night, with the only light emanating from Samuel's ghost. The figures may be standing on the top of a tomb or grave from which Samuel's ghost has emerged.

Both of his legs are bent. His gesture and expression suggest surprise.</illusobjdesc>
