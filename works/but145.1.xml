            <updatestmt> 
The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of a digital edition of forty-seven monochrome wash drawings created by Blake between c. 1774 and c. 1786.  
<lb/>
<lb/>
The use of monochrome washes to tint a pencil or pen and ink drawing offered eighteenth-century artists several advantages. They could register gradations in tone, from the white of the untouched paper to jet black, without the more time-consuming use of actual colors. No further work was required if the wash drawing was intended as a preliminary for an uncolored engraving. A monochrome wash could also be used to underlie subsequent applications of water colors, thereby darkening selected areas to create the illusion of depth or cast motifs in shadow.  
<lb/>
<lb/>
As the works presented here show, Blake made full use of monochrome washes from his earliest years as an artist. When assigned by his engraving master, James Basire, to record tombs in Westminster Abbey c. 1774-75, Blake applied black and gray washes to tint many of his drawings (Objects 1-5). These carefully executed works could then be used as preliminaries for subsequent engravings by Basire’s workshop.
<lb/>
<lb/>
Blake’s monochrome washes during his first decade as an independent artist and engraver include several interrelated groups. The seven drawings of figures from Michelangelo’s Sistine ceiling (Objects 37-43) demonstrate how copying engravings of works by Renaissance masters helped Blake learn postures and gestures he would later use in his own compositions. Other drawings provide visual evidence of how Blake developed a design from early sketches to highly finished water colors or engravings. The recto/verso drawings, <hi rend="i">Two Sketches for “Joseph Making Himself Known to His Brethren”</hi> (Objects 34 and 35), are preliminaries for the finished water color in the Fitzwilliam Museum, one of three illustrations of the biblical story of Joseph that are among Blake’s finest pictorial works of the 1780s. The three Joseph water colors are in the Archive along with a water color preliminary for <hi rend="i">Joseph Ordering Simeon to be Bound</hi>. The evolution of one of Blake’s earliest original book illustrations, a frontispiece for Thomas Commins’ <hi rend="i">Elegy Set to Music</hi> of 1786, can be traced through three variant wash drawings (Objects 45-47) and a pencil sketch also in the Archive. The four wash versions of <hi rend="i">The Good Farmer</hi> reproduced here (Objects 16-19), in addition to two pen and ink drawings of the subject previously added to the Archive, show the complex ways Blake played variations on a theme as he worked toward a final version. No such finished work is known, and thus these drawings are our only record of Blake’s engagement with this subject. Similarly, for <hi rend="i">War Unchained by an Angel, Fire, Pestilence, and Famine Following</hi>, an untraced work Blake exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1784, we have only a preliminary study (Object 6).
<lb/>
<lb/>
Blake’s illustrations to his poem <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> of c. 1789 are among his most accomplished monochrome wash drawings. These have been published in the Archive as an independent group coordinated with the <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> manuscript.

                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>In the right third of the drawing stands the King of Babylon, who appears to be led into hell by an angel or other supernatural being. The king has short, curly hair and a beard; he wears a crown on his head and a long, draping robe that may cover a gown or other garment. The tops of the king's feet appear to be bare, but the presence of material beneath the soles suggests that he may be wearing sandals. His right foot points leftward, and his left foot points toward the viewer. The king appears to be walking toward the left side of the design. His body faces forward and to the left, but his head turns sharply to the right as he looks behind him. The king's arms are lowered in front of him and crossed at the wrists, left over right. His fingers point downward. He appears to be shackled to a chain. Holding the links at the end of this chain is an angel or some other male figure who hovers behind the king and appears to be leading him into or through hell.  This is probably Satan. This figure has long, curly hair and is nude from the waist up. He wears a long skirt, the end of which appears at right of the king and floats above the angel's bare left foot and ankle. The angel's body rises diagonally behind the king, and his chest faces forward and to the left near the king's right shoulder. The angel's muscular left arm extends down and across his body to grasp the chain. His right arm extends horizontally as he points left. The angel, like the king, turns his head to the right; however, the angel looks upward. His mouth is opened slightly. To the right of the king and angel figures, in the upper right-hand corner of the drawing, appear the heads of at least two men. These men face forward and to the right; they appear to be reclining or leaning backward. The man at left wears a helmet that covers his forehead and wraps around his jaw on the visible right side. His eyes open wide and his mouth parts slightly in an expression of fear or dread. To the right of this man is another who wears a similarly fearful expression. This man has a beard, and he wears a plumed helmet that covers his head but not the sides of his face. At right of these men are some wavy lines that may indicate the hair of another figure. Above these lines is a round object that could represent another helmet. Alternatively, the round object may be a shield, and the two pointed objects rising diagonally leftward from it may be spears. A second group of men appears in the lower left quarter of the design, beneath the angel's outstretched arm. Directly below the angel's right hand is a group of three other kings who sit or recline and gaze upward toward the angel and the King of Babylon. Nearest the angel appears the head and shoulders of an old man with long, white hair and a beard. The man faces forward and to the right, tilting his head upward to gaze at the King of Babylon. The man's eyes are wide, and his mouth is open in an expression of fear. He wears a short crown atop his head. To the left of the old king--nearer to the viewer--is another, younger king. He has short hair and a dark beard, and he wears a long-sleeved gown and a short, pointed crown. This king appears to be seated with his body facing the viewer but leaning toward the left; he may recline or shrink back in fear. His legs extend to the right, and his torso twists away from the angel as his left arm crosses his body. The king's head turns up and to the right, and he stares in terror at the angel or at the King of Babylon. His mouth may be open. Below and to the left of this man is a third king who also gazes in fear at the angel and the King of Babylon. This king is older, with white hair and a white beard. He wears a crown but is otherwise nude. His muscular chest appears to emerge from the ground, or he may be sitting and partially covered. The king's body faces forward and to the right, and he leans backward away from the floating angel. He lifts his right arm to shoulder level and bends it sharply so that his forearm extends forward alongside his head. His palm faces the ground. The king's head tilts back as he faces upward and to the right. Directly above this king's head, in the shadows behind the three seated kings, is the head of another man. He faces up and to the right, and he appears to wear a helmet on his head. He may have a mustache, and his mouth may open in an expression of fear as he gazes upward toward the angel. Below the kings, seemingly mired in mud, are four other men. They are, from left to right: an old, nude man with long hair and a beard who faces right and gazes upward toward the angel; an old man with short, curly hair and a beard who likewise stares at the angel; an armored man in a plumed helmet who bends his right arm upward and turns his palm toward the viewer; and a second armored man with a curly beard who faces forward but leans to the left, away from the King of Babylon. Wavy lines to the left of the leftmost figure in this group may suggest the hair of a fifth indistinct figure. The ground below the King of Babylon, in which the other men appear to be stuck or from which they emerge, seems to be earthen, perhaps made of mud or quicksand. Between the three seated kings and the King of Babylon, several round objects alternate with vertical lines, perhaps suggesting a set of helmets and spears. Alternatively, the round objects could be helmets. Immediately above these implements is a large cloud that occupies the space behind the floating angel. The drawing's background is generally dark, and significant shadows appear below the angel's left arm and in the folds of the King of Babylon's robe.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>In the right third of the drawing stands the King of Babylon, who appears to be led into hell by an angel or other supernatural being. The king has short, curly hair and a beard; he wears a crown on his head and a long, draping robe that may cover a gown or other garment. The tops of the king's feet appear to be bare, but the presence of material beneath the soles suggests that he may be wearing sandals. His right foot points leftward, and his left foot points toward the viewer. The king appears to be walking toward the left side of the design. His body faces forward and to the left, but his head turns sharply to the right as he looks behind him. The king's arms are lowered in front of him and crossed at the wrists, left over right. His fingers point downward. He appears to be shackled to a chain.</illusobjdesc>

This is probably Satan. This figure has long, curly hair and is nude from the waist up. He wears a long skirt, the end of which appears at right of the king and floats above the angel's bare left foot and ankle. The angel's body rises diagonally behind the king, and his chest faces forward and to the left near the king's right shoulder. The angel's muscular left arm extends down and across his body to grasp the chain. His right arm extends horizontally as he points toward the design's left border. The angel, like the king, turns his head to the right; however, the angel looks upward. His mouth is opened slightly.</illusobjdesc>

This king appears to be seated with his body facing the viewer but leaning toward the left; he may recline or shrink back in fear. His legs extend to the right, and his torso twists away from the angel as his left arm crosses his body.

                        <illusobjdesc>Below the kings, seemingly mired in mud, are four other men. Rightmost is a second armored man with a curly beard. He faces forward and to the right, leaning to the left--away from the King of Babylon--and tilting his head backward as he stares upward with a fearful expression. He bends his left arm downward and across his body. This man may also be a soldier.</illusobjdesc>

More shields and spears may appear between the three kings and the King of Babylon, where round objects alternate with vertical lines. Alternatively, the round objects may be helmets.</illusobjdesc>
