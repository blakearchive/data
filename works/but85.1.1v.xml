                    <illusobjdesc>Four composition sketches are each separated by rough framing lines.  The sketch in the upper left quadrant contains the partly erased figure of a man(?) facing forward with arms raised at roughly 135 degrees.  Both feet are visible.  Brushstrokes of grey wash on either side of the tree partially obscure background detail which may include vegetation and clouds.  The sketch in the upper right quadrant contains two erect figures preparing to stab a third figure reclining on the ground.  A diagonal brushstroke of grey wash was applied over the figural group.  The sketch in the lower left quadrant contains two figures reclining on the ground, heads at left.  They are very similar to the figures in *Milton a Poem*, Bentley Plate 38.  Two vertical brushstrokes of grey wash are drawn over the figures' torsos.  There are clouds, or possibly a figure with arms or wings outstretched, above them.  The sketch in the lower right quadrant contains two figures; the lower figure reclines on the ground and looks up and to the left toward the second figure, who appears to rise from clouds.  This sketch runs over onto the verso of another page of sketches (Butlin 86 verso), indicating that the two pages were originally part of the same sheet of paper.</illusobjdesc>

The leftmost figure, whose gender is indeterminate though likely male, partially stands, though his right knee appears to be bent behind him in a kneeling posture.  His left leg is extended in front of him and also bent.  Facing right, he extends his right arm horizontally and holds what may be a dagger.  He may be preparing to stab the reclining figure below.  He appears to be gowned.  His body is partially obscured by a diagonal brushstroke of grey wash.</illusobjdesc>

The rightmost erect figure, whose gender is indeterminate but likely male, faces forward and leans to the right.  He may wear a gown.  He extends his left arm horizontally and holds what may be a dagger (though this form is only suggested by a single line).  He appears to look toward the figure at left, although there are indications of an alternative head position facing right.  He may be preparing to stab the reclining figure below.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>Four composition sketches are each separated by rough framing lines.  The sketch in the lower right quadrant contains two figures.  Only visible from the waist up as he floats or hovers on clouds, the figure at top right faces and leans right and appears to look down toward the reclining figure below.  The gender of this figure is indeterminable, though perhaps male as he wears a gown and may offer a gesture of blessing (two fingers raised on his right hand) with his extended right arm.  His left arm may also be slightly raised.</illusobjdesc>
