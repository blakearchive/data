            <note>The complete group of twelve designs probably inherited at Blake's death in 1827 by his wife Catherine; acquired by Frederick Tatham at Catherine Blake's death in 1831; the dealer Joseph Hogarth; sold Southgate and Barrett auction, London, 8 June 1854, lot 643 (&#163;3 to "Morley," possibly a dealer); Elhanan Bicknell, sold from his collection Christie's, 1 May 1863, lots 377-88, dispersed.

               <illusobjdesc>This design illustrates Blake's <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> manuscript, Archive Object 2, lines 21-23. On the left side of the image, blind Tiriel stands, facing right and supporting his dying wife, Myratana. He is an old man, mostly bald with a long beard and he wears a long gown. Both feet are visible beneath the hem of his gown. His brow is furrowed in anger as his right arm is raised horizontally and his left arm wraps around Myratana's waist to hold her. His right eye appears to be closed. The fingers of both hands are slightly spread. To the right is Tiriel's wife, Myratana. She partly stands and partly leans on her husband, with her left arm at her side and her right arm draped over his left shoulder and dangles down his back. Her left arm dangles limply along her left side. She has long hair and wears a long gown. Her legs are bent at the knee and her sandaled left foot is visible beneath the hem of her gown. She faces right and slightly forward, though her face is partially obscured by Tiriel's right arm. On the right side of the design stand three men, very probably Tiriel's sons. All of the sons face forward and turn to look left, with their legs spread and their left feet on tiptoe. These sons cast shadows to the left.  The leftmost son has short, curly hair that seems to have a curling grape vine placed in it. He appears to be nude except for a short cape draping over his right shoulder. His mouth may be partly open and he may be frowning slightly. His right arm is bent over his chest. The center son appears to be wearing a toga or draping gown, as his right shoulder is bare but cloth is visible covering his stomach and falling to his knees. His head is crowned with laurel leaves. His right arm is bent and held across his chest. His mouth may be slightly open. The rightmost son wears a dark gown with a cloak draping over his shoulders. He has long, curly hair and a curly beard. On his head he wears a spiky crown. This may be Heuxos, described in the text as a king. His right arm is at his side, with the palm facing out and fingers spread. His left arm is at his side, palm down. His mouth is open as though speaking to his parents. The figures stand in a classical setting, with four marble columns visible. In the background, a cloudy sky backs a landscape of rolling hills and a winding river. On the right side of the background, a pyramid is visible, suggesting an Egyptian setting.</illusobjdesc>

               <illusobjdesc>This design illustrates Blake's <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> manuscript, but it does not correspond to any specific passage in the text. In the center of the image sit two nude figures with long white hair, Har and Heva. They look at each other and rest with their faces touching. Har, the old man on the left, has a long beard. He is twisted so that his torso mostly faces forward but he looks to the right. His right arm is at his side and bent across his chest with his hand floating on top of the water. Har's left arm is raised horizontally and draped over Heva's shoulders. His legs, visible under the surface of the water, are bent. Heva, the woman on the right, is twisted so that her lower body faces right while her upper body faces left. Her left arm is at her side but bent upward with her left hand covering her left breast. She leans left into Har's embrace. Har and Heva are sitting in a body of water with a rippled surface, presumably a stream but possibly a lake or pond. Behind Har and Heva lies Mnetha, reclining. She also has long white hair and wears a long gown that seems to droop so that her right breast is exposed. The gown is belted beneath her breasts. Both of her feet are visible beneath the hem of her gown, and their positioning suggests that her legs are crossed. She looks into the middle distance. Her left arm is at her side but bent to support her weight, with her left hand palm down on the ground. Her right arm also appears to be at her side. She faces forward and left. The bank on which Mnetha lies may be grassy or mossy. At least five tree trunks line the background of the scene. The leftmost two trees may have leaves on their branches. In the top right background of the image are vertical lines that may suggest a sheer rockface, thin tree trunks in the distance, or the draping fabric of a tent. </illusobjdesc>

                  <illusobjdesc>This design illustrates Blake's <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> manuscript, Archive Object 5, lines 1-3. On the left side of the image, blind Tiriel kneels while Har stands, blessing him. Tiriel, an old, gowned man with a beard and fringe of hair at the back of his head faces right with his eyes closed. His visible right arm is at his side but bent slightly. He bends forward slightly and his mouth may be partly open. The rightmost of the male figures, Har, is an old man with long hair and a long beard. He wears a gown and stands with his arms raised horizontally, palms down on Tiriel's head. He faces left and looks at Tiriel, bending forward slightly. On the right side of the image stand two female figures, Heva and Mnetha. Heva is a gowned old woman with long hair and a mantle or cloth over her head. Tears may be streaming down her face. Her arms are raised just below the horizontal and wrapped around the waist of Mnetha to the right. Her right leg is bent slightly and she bends forward, resting her head on Mnetha's breasts in a child-like gesture of position of fear. Her body faces right but she turns her head to look to the left. The rightmost figure, Mnetha, stands, facing left and looking down slightly. She wears a gown that appears to be belted and has an elaborate design of flowers, leaves, and vines. Beneath the hem of her gown, at least one shoe is visible. Her hair is covered by a net or cloth. Her right arm is draped around Heva's waist and her left arm is at her side but bent, perhaps also embracing and comforting Heva. The figures appear to be standing in, or in front of, a structure with a paneled wall and a smooth floor. In the bottom right corner of the image stand a table draped with a cloth and what may be a high-backed chair, facing right. Beyond the left edge of the paneled wall, in the left background of the design, at least seven tree trunks with leafy branches are visible. The ground may be grassy. The trees are backed by high hills or mountains, behind which is a cloudy, sky. </illusobjdesc>

               <illusobjdesc>This design illustrates Blake's <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> manuscript, Archive Object 7, lines 10-11. In the left foreground, blind Tiriel stands or walks facing left. He holds in his hands a long staff or walking stick. His arms are at his side but bent, the left arm raised at 45 degrees and the right bent upward, in order to hold his staff. He is an old man, mostly bald except for a fringe of hair around the back of his head and a cropped beard. He wears a long gown, under the hem of which his left foot is visible. His mouth may be slightly open. Tiriel's depiction in this image highlights his blindness. On the right side of the image, Har and Heva stand in a doorway, holding onto one another and watching Tiriel leave. Har, an old man, stands to the left. He has long white hair and a beard and wears a long gown. His body faces right and forward but he looks to the left, with his mouth partly open. His arms are at his sides but bent to embrace Heva. Heva, the old woman, stands to the right. She has long hair and wears a long gown that may be belted at the waist. Her left leg appears to be bent. Her body faces left but her head is turned to look partly forward. Her mouth is open and she may be crying, with a trace of tears visible beneath her left eye. On her head she wears a cloth or mantle. Her left arm is raised at 45 degrees and bent to embrace Har. Har and Heva stand in front of an open doorway that seems to be part of a house, perhaps made of wood or stone. The ground at the bottom of the image may be grassy, with some moss(?) visible to the left of Har's feet and at the bases of many of the trees in the scene. At least ten trees with leafy branches are visible in the middle ground of the image. To either side of Heva and Har stand two trees that appear to be birches, given their bark. A sapling or other leafy vegetation, possibly ivy, grows to the left of the rightmost tree. In the left background of the design, large hills or mountains are visible. A cloudy sky is visible in the top left corner of the scene.</illusobjdesc>

               <illusobjdesc>This design illustrates Blake's <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> manuscript, Archive Object 9, lines 8-32. The left side of the image is dominated by two figures, Ijim and blind Tiriel. Both figures cast shadows back and to the right. Ijim sits or squats on a stone step or plinth. He is muscular and nude and has dark curly hair and a beard. He faces forward and looks to the right, with his right leg bent and right foot on tiptoe and his left leg bent and extended backward. His arms are raised horizontally and bent upward in order to support his brother Tiriel, whom he holds on his shoulders. Tiriel sits on his brother Ijim's shoulders. He is an old man with a cropped beard. He is mostly bald except for a fringe of hair around the back of his head. Tiriel wears a long gown. He faces slightly forward and looks to the right at his children. His left arm is raised horizontally, fingers somewhat spread. His right arm is at his side but bent across his chest. His legs are both bent, with his left leg braced against the step that Ijim sits on. He is in the process of cursing his children, and his mouth is open as he's speaking. On the right side of the image, six of Tiriel's children are visible: three daughters and three sons. The leftmost son, Heuxos, described as a king in the text, kneels at Ijim's feet. He wears a long, dark gown with a light belt at the waist and a light cloak. Topping his long hair is a spiky crown. He bends forward, arms raised at 135 degrees and bent upward so that his hands are on the ground. His bowing gesture suggests supplication. Heuxos casts a shadow as well. The son above on the left is mostly nude, with a toga-like cloth draping from his left shoulder across his lower half. He faces forward and looks to the left, mouth open. His right arm is at his side but bent, and he may be touching or leaning into his brother to the right. He may be kneeling. The rightmost son has short, curly hair and wears a gown. He faces left and leans backward slightly. His left arm is at his side and he is probably also kneeling. His mouth may be partly open. Three of Tiriel's daughters stand on the right of the image. They are likely all gowned, with long, slightly curly hair, looking to the left at their father. The leftmost daughter may be frowning or crying, with her body facing right and forward. The center daughter's mouth is open in an expression of surprise and perhaps fear. Her right arm is at her side but bent and she holds the waist of her sister to the right. Her body faces right and forward. The rightmost daughter is the only dark-haired female of the group. She may be Hela. Her mouth is open in an expression of fear and confusion. Her left arm is bent upward to rest on the right shoulder of her sister to the left. She faces left and slightly forward. The scene occurs in a room, perhaps Tiriel's palace, with a stone step or plinth on the left side, against an outjutting of the wall. The back wall is marked by a rectangular pilaster toward the center of the image. In the front left foreground, a curved walking stick, resembling a very long cane or a shepherd's crook, lies on the floor. </illusobjdesc>

His arms are raised horizontally and bent upward in order to support his brother Tiriel, whom he holds on his shoulders. </illusobjdesc>

Tiriel sits on his brother Ijim's shoulders. He is an old man with a cropped beard. He is mostly bald except for a fringe of hair around the back of his head. Tiriel wears a long gown. He faces slightly forward and looks to the right at his children. His left arm is raised horizontally, fingers somewhat spread. His right arm is at his side but bent across his chest. His legs are both bent, with his left leg braced against the step that Ijim sits on. He is in the process of cursing his children, and his mouth is open as he's speaking.  </illusobjdesc>

He bends forward, arms raised at 135 degrees and bent upward so that his hands are on the ground. His bowing gesture suggests supplication. Heuxos casts a shadow to the right and backward as well. </illusobjdesc>

               <illusobjdesc>This design illustrates Blake's <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> manuscript, Archive Object 11, lines 19-20. The center of the composition is dominated by blind Tiriel surrounded by his daughters. He is bearded and bald, except for a fringe of hair falling over his neck, and wears a gown. He stands facing right, with arms extended horizontally and the fingers of both hands spread.  His mouth may be slightly open as he denounces his children. The five daughters are kneeling around Tiriel; four assume postures suggesting supplication. They all wear gowns with indications of belts at the waist. The daughter furthest left has long hair and extends her right arm at 135 degrees. She faces up and to the right. Her mouth is open; she may be speaking or crying out. The daughter second from the left is bent over to the right in a contracted posture, right foot on tiptoe.  Her right arm is bent upward over her face. Her long dark hair indicates that she is probably Hela. The daughter third from the left has long, slightly curly hair; her left arm is extended at 135 degrees. She faces left and away from the viewer, her left leg extended backwards with her left foot on tiptoe. The daughter second from the right faces up and to the left, her hands clasped in supplication or prayer. Her mouth is open; she may be speaking or crying out. Her hair is long. The daughter furthest right raises her arms vertically, with the fingers of at least her left hand spread apart. She faces up and to the left. Her hair is long and her mouth is open; she may be speaking or crying out. The right side of the composition includes four sons of Tiriel, all standing and probably looking at their father. The frontmost son is probably Heuxos, described as a king in the text. The other sons may be Lotho, Clithyma, and Makuth, also named in the poem. We see only the face, facing left, of the son furthest right. The frontmost son, Heuxos, faces forward with his head turned toward the left. He wears a gown or toga, a cloak, and a spiky crown. He is bearded and wears a crown. He may be frowning. We see only the long gown or cloak and head of the son second from the left. He has curly hair and a beard. He may be frowning. The son furthest to the left faces forward and to the left. His hair is probably long. There are no clear indications of clothing, but he may be gowned. His mouth may be slightly open; his expression suggests surprise or fear. His right arm is lowered across his chest. Blake first drew this arm in a very different position, raised and bent with the right arm touching the right side of this son's head. This first version of the arm is still visible as an outline. The scene probably takes place in a room, possibly in Tiriel's palace, or at least before a wall, with a pillar or pilaster on the far left.  Shadows appear on the wall right of the column, below Tiriel, lower right on the wall between the daughters and the sons, and on the floor right of the daughters.</illusobjdesc>

               <illusobjdesc>This design illustrates Blake's <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> manuscript, Archive Object 13, lines 12-13, or possibly line 2 of Object 14. In the center of the design stand two figures. The rightmost figure is blind Tiriel, an old, mostly bald man with a cropped beard and a fringe of hair around the back of his head. He wears a gown or cloak, beneath the hem of which his right foot is visible. His left leg is bent at the knee, suggesting that he is walking forward. His left arm is at his side but covered by his garment. His right arm is bent so that he can hold his daughter's upper left arm as she guides him. The leftmost figure of this pair is Tiriel's youngest daughter, Hela. She wears a gown that droops to expose her right breast. She has dark, long, curly hair with at least four serpents on her head. Her arms are at her sides but bent across her body with hands clasped together. Her feet are both on tiptoe, with her left leg extended forward and her right leg extended backward. She appears to be in mid-stride. Hela and Tiriel seem to cast shadows on the ground to the left. The two figures walk through a meadow or grassy(?) plain with trees on either side of the foreground as well as in the background to the right of Tiriel. Indeterminate vegetation, perhaps leafy bushes, are visible beside the trees in the background. Large hills or mountains are visible in the background. The scene is backed by a cloudy sky.</illusobjdesc>

               <illusobjdesc>This design illustrates Blake's <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> manuscript, Archive Object 14, lines 25-26. Har and Heva lie in a bed, sleeping and facing one another. Har, who faces forward, is an old man with long, white hair and a beard. He appears to be wearing a sleeveless gown. He lies facing forward and with his right arm raised horizontally, resting on Heva's waist. Heva is an old woman with long, white hair, who lies facing away. She appears to wear a gown. Both Har and Heva rest on a bed with a mattress, at least one large pillow, possibly a sheet, and a blanket with an elaborate design of flowers, leaves, and vines. The bed also has hanging curtains, visible in the top right corner of the design, although bedposts are not clearly indicated. Mnetha reclines behind Har and Heva, facing forward and looking down to the right to watch them sleep. She wears a gown that exposes her right breast and she has long, white hair. Her right arm is at her side and rests across her lap, while she presumably leans on her left arm. She may be smiling. The wall in the background appears to be decorated with a sketched image of large fern-like plants and a nude child, perhaps a hovering cherub or putto, that faces right and forward. The cherub's arms are raised at 135 degrees and its legs are extended backward. It may have wings or it may hold onto (or even hang from) the stem of a large, lily-like flower that droops to the left. </illusobjdesc>
