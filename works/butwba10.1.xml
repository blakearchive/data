                <lb/>
                <lb/>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of fully searchable and scalable electronic editions of the following works related to Blake’s development of his illustrations to Robert Blair’s 
                <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>
                : Preliminary Sketches for Robert Blair’s 
                <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>
                , listed under Drawings and Paintings, Pencil Sketches; Preliminary Drawings for Robert Blair’s 
                <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>
                , listed under Drawings and Paintings, Monochrome Wash Drawings; and Preliminary Illustrations to Robert Blair’s 
                <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>
                , listed under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.
                <lb/>
                <lb/>
                In addition, we are republishing the following works, previously presented in our Preview mode, to make their designs fully searchable: Robert Blair, 
                <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>
                , the 1808 book listed under Commercial Book Illustrations, Designed by Blake and Engraved by Other Engravers; 
                <hi rend="i">Deaths Door</hi>
                , listed under Separate Plates and Plates in Series, Designed and Engraved by Blake; and Illustrations to Robert Blair’s 
                <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>
                , the series of twenty finished designs, listed under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.
                <lb/>
                <lb/>
                Taken together, these works in a variety of media present a comprehensive overview of one of Blake’s major projects as an illustrator and exemplify his working methods as he developed rough sketches into finished water colors.  The evolution of any one design can be traced via links presented under Related Works in the Archive on the pull-down menus, lower left on the main viewing page for each work. 
                <lb/>
                <lb/>
                In October 1805, Blake was commissioned by the engraver and would-be publisher Robert H. Cromek to prepare forty drawings illustrating Robert Blair's 
                <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>
                , a popular &quot;Graveyard&quot; school poem first published in 1743.  Cromek originally planned to select twenty of these designs for a deluxe edition of the poem.  Blake launched into the project with great enthusiasm, rapidly sketching out his illustrations in pencil, developing some into wash drawings, and then producing a group of more finished water colors for presentation to Cromek.  In a first prospectus of November 1805, Cromek names Blake as both the designer and engraver of fifteen designs.  Blake etched one image, 
                <hi rend="i">Deaths Door</hi>
                , in white-line, but Cromek rejected it.  The dark power of the print appeals to modern tastes, but was far from fashionable in the early nineteenth century.  In a second prospectus, also of November 1805, Cromek announced that Louis Schiavonetti would engrave twelve designs for the new edition.  Blake had lost the potentially lucrative commission to engrave his own designs; his relationship with Cromek descended into anger and argument.  In spite of their disagreement, Cromek included a portrait of Blake as a frontispiece to the volume, published in 1808.  Cromek promoted the book aggressively and the illustrations to 
                <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>
                became Blake's best known work through much of the nineteenth century.

                <lb/>
                <lb/>
                The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an
                electronic edition of Blake's water color illustrations for Robert Blair's 
                <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>
                . These are probably the twenty designs selected in 1805
                by R. H. Cromek for publication in his forthcoming edition of 
                <hi rend="i">The
                    Grave</hi>
                , although only twelve were engraved by Louis Schiavonetti for the
                volume, published in 1808. One design, 
                <hi rend="i">The Widow Embracing her
                    Husband's Grave</hi>
                , has been known for many years, but the other nineteen
                water colors disappeared between their auction in 1836 and their dramatic
                rediscovery in 2001. These nineteen were sold individually at auction in spring 2006
                and are now widely dispersed. The Grave water colors are presented in our Preview
                mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and
                Inote (our image annotation program). They join Schiavonetti's engravings and
                Blake's white-line etching of one design, &quot;Deaths Door,&quot; previously published in the Archive.

                    was originally part of this group of designs, as the style and size of the
                    backing mount indicate, but became detached from the other 19 designs at an
                    unknown time, possibly by the mid-nineteenth century. This may be the design
                    sold from the stock of the dealer Joseph Hogarth, Southgate and Barrett auction,
                    London, 7 June 1854, lot 237, described as &quot;Children at the Grave of their
                    Parent&quot; (with 5 others, 11s. to H. Palser). The later history of Object 4 is as
                    follows: J. F. Hall by 1876; the dealer Carfax &amp; Co., London; Mrs. Louisa
                    Bishop, nee Salaman, by 1912; her son, Euston Bishop, probably by gift or
                    inheritance; sold Sotheby's, 19 May 1958, lot 11 (£280 to the dealer Agnew's
                    acting for Gwen, Lady Melchett); sold from Lady Melchett's collection,
                    Christie's, 9 Nov. 1971, lot 74 (£2100 to the dealer Baskett and Day acting for
                    Mr. and Mrs. Paul Mellon); given by Mellon in 1975 to the Yale Center for
                    British Art.</note>

                <objsize>33.2 x 26.6 cm.</objsize>
                <objnote>
                    <p>The design is based on one or both passages in the poem describing the
                        resurrection of the dead, pages 28 and 32 of the 1808 edition. Both passages
                        refer to the quickening &quot;trump&quot;; only the first refers to a &quot;strong lung'd
                        cherub.&quot; The sheet is larger than any of the other designs in the group of
                        twenty and extends to the edges of the cardboard mount. The text is in
                        Blake's hand. Although the design may have been executed along with other
                        illustrations to Blair's poem in Oct.-Nov. 1805, Blake could not have added
                        the text before he had learned, in late Nov. or early Dec. 1805, that Louis
                        Schiavonetti had been hired to engrave the designs. The &quot;1806&quot; date would in
                        that case have been anticipatory or not added until that year. It is also
                        possible that this water color was a later addition to the group, executed
                        in the same year as the inscribed date. The design and a revised version of
                        the text were etched and engraved by Louis Schiavonetti and published in
                        Robert Cromek's 1808 edition of 
                        *The Grave*
                        . This is the
                        only published design not listed in Cromek's first prospectus of Nov. 1805,
                        although it might have been originally intended as the &quot;characteristic
                        Frontispiece&quot; listed in that document. A possible preliminary sketch has
                        been untraced since 1911 (Butlin 609). A water color drawing of the
                        descending angel with a trumpet, now in the Yale Center for British Art, is
                        also related (Butlin 611). An alternative title page design in water color,
                        now in the Huntington Library (Butlin 616), is also dated 1806. That work is
                        inscribed &quot;A Series of Designs Invented &amp; Engraved by William Blake&quot; and
                        may have been intended as a title page for a portfolio of drawings rather
                        than prints.</p>

                    <illusobjdesc>A nude male trumpeter hovers upside down in the right half of the
                        design. He may be a wingless angel descending to awaken the skeleton below.
                        His body faces forward with his genitals clearly visible. His head is bent
                        back and faces down; he likely looks at the skeleton below. His hair is
                        short and may also be curly. The figure's legs are together and extend up
                        and to the left. His arms are bent and are raised vertically with respect to
                        his body. He holds and plays a trumpet with his hands together and the
                        fingers spread. A skeleton lies supine across the lower border of the
                        design, facing up. The figure's legs are together and bent to the left. The
                        skeleton's left arm rests at its side with the hand on the ground, palm
                        down. Its right arm is bent over its shoulder; the skeleton appears to hold
                        part of a cloth shroud with its right hand. The figure's head is up and bent
                        back with its mouth open and teeth clearly visible. A stone(?) structure,
                        perhaps part of a tomb or coffin, extends to the left of the skeleton. Fire
                        surrounds the skeleton and a large cloud of smoke rises above and to the
                        right.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Christ stands in the center of the design, facing forward. He
                        descends a set of stairs or steps with his left leg and foot prominent and
                        his right leg bent back. Both feet are visible and his right foot is raised
                        on tiptoe. Christ is gowned and has long, curly hair and a beard. A halo of
                        light surrounds his head and shoulders, and beams of light radiate outward
                        around his body. His arms are raised at 45 degrees and he holds a large key
                        in each hand. Christ casts a shadow on the stairs to the left. A wall with
                        an open doorway is visible at the top of the stairs. A (hellish?) fire burns
                        along the lower border of the design; it appears to divide to the left and
                        right at Christ's approach. The setting is mid-way between heaven, perhaps
                        represented by the portal behind Christ, and the grave into which he
                        descends.</illusobjdesc>

                            death&quot; referenced in the poem (page 1 of the 1808 edition). Each key
                            bears the design of a cross. Christ casts a shadow on the stairs to the

                    <p>The design is based on the description of &quot;light-heel'd ghosts&quot; on page 2 of
                        the 1808 edition. The backing mount is inscribed, not by Blake, with a few
                        mostly erased words below the design. The last two words in this inscription
                        may be &quot;variously D . . . l . . . &quot; or &quot;virtuously D . . . l . . . &quot; The

                        engraved. A preliminary sketch is in the Yale Center for British Art (Butlin
                        636). The design was not published in the 1808 edition, nor is it listed in
                        Cromek's first prospectus of Nov. 1805.</p>

                <illustration location="E" type="plate">
                    <illusobjdesc>The scene takes place in a graveyard that stretches across the
                        lower portion of the design. Two gravestones appear in the lower left corner
                        and at least two tombs stand in the lower right corner. A Gothic church
                        stands at the left border of the design. The roof is decorated with several
                        sharply pointed spires and a cross is visible above a large, arched doorway.
                        A single visible stair or step appears below the door. At least eleven
                        figures stand or walk in a procession to the right of the church. The
                        leftmost figure stands in the doorway of the church and is seen from behind.
                        Only the figure's left leg is clearly pictured. A gowned figure with a hood
                        or veil stands second from the left. The figure's left arm is bent and he or
                        she holds a lit candle. A pair of gowned figures (possibly children) stand
                        third and fourth from the left. The child to the left faces forward and
                        holds a lit candle with both hands. The child to the right is seen from
                        behind and faces away. He or she likely holds the lit candle visible above.
                        A pair of gowned males with long hair stand fifth and sixth from the left.
                        The figure to the left is apparently in mid-stride with one leg bent
                        forward. His left arm is bent and he holds an open book. His eyes are down
                        and his mouth is open; he may be reading or speaking. The figure seventh
                        from the left holds a plate or tray carrying loaves of bread or other food.
                        The figure eighth from the left holds a candle with both hands and may
                        represent a child. His or her mouth is open in an expression of fear or
                        surprise; the figure may look at the ghosts below. Only the upper body of
                        the figure ninth from the left is visible. The figure has long hair and
                        faces left. The figure tenth from the left holds a tray carrying three glass
                        goblets filled with dark liquid, possibly wine. The head of the figure
                        furthest right is visible above a pair of legs resting on a tomb. The figure
                        faces forward with his or her mouth open in an expression suggesting fear or
                        surprise. The figure may look at the ghosts to the left and right. A leafy
                        tree with distinct branches stands on a grassy hill in the center of the
                        design. The full moon appears in the night sky to the left of the tree. Six
                        figures run or dance to the left and right the tree in the center of the
                        design; they may represent ghosts. The figure furthest left is seen from
                        behind and bends or arches to the right with his or her left leg extended
                        backward. The figure's right hand covers his or her face. The figure second
                        from the left is seen from behind and strides to the right. The figure's
                        right arm is bent upward, and the figure's right hand covers his or her
                        face. Third from the left, a male with short, curly hair is seen from
                        behind. He strides to the left with his left leg bent and right leg extended
                        back to the right. The figure's arms are raised nearly horizontally with the
                        palms held vertically and out away from his body. A gowned female appears
                        fourth from the left. She runs to the right with her left foot raised on
                        tiptoe and her right leg bent and raised off the ground. Both arms are bent
                        upward; her right palm is turned out towards the viewer and her left palm is
                        turned up. A gowned female with long hair appears fifth from the left. The
                        figure runs to the left with her left leg bent forward and her left foot
                        raised on tiptoe. Both arms are bent upward; her hands may clutch at her
                        head. A nude male stands furthest right with his left leg bent and crossed
                        behind his right; his left foot is raised off the ground. The figure is
                        hunched over with his head down. Both arms are crossed and wrapped around
                        his head. Twenty-six figures appear near the borders or corners of the
                        design. The heads of two buried figures appear in the lower left corner of
                        the design. The head to the left is turned up and faces right; the head to
                        the right is bald and faces left. The upper bodies of two nude figures
                        appear in the lower left portion of the design; the figures are partially
                        buried in the earth. The figure to the left has long hair and may be female.
                        She faces right with her head bent back and her mouth open. Her left arm
                        rests on the ground and extends down and to the right; her left hand is
                        curled into a fist. The figure to the right is male and has short hair. He
                        faces forward with his head turned to the left; his mouth is open and he may
                        look toward the figure to the left. The figure's right arm is bent upward
                        with the hand curled into a fist; his left hand may rest on the ground to
                        the right and is also curled into a fist. A nude, bald male lies on the
                        ground at the lower border of the design with his torso horizontal. His
                        right leg is bent and drawn up and his left leg is extended up and to the
                        right; another ghost holds and likely pulls him by the ankle. His left arm
                        is bent and rests on the ground; both hands grasp the tombstone to the left.
                        A nude, bald male hovers or flies in the lower right portion of the design.
                        Both arms are extended down and to the left; he grasps and may pull the
                        ankle of the ghost below with both hands. A candle and an open book rest on
                        the ground to the right of a tombstone along the lower border of the design.
                        The candle is lit and appears to be placed in a candle holder. A bishop's
                        croier (a staff with a coiled terminal) appears to the right. A nude male
                        with short, curly hair crouches on a tomb in the lower right corner of the
                        design. Both arms are down and he holds and pulls the hair of the buried
                        figure below. The figure below is visible from the eyes up and may cast a
                        shadow to the right. The upper body of a nude, bald figure appears in the
                        lower right portion of the design. The figure faces right with its shoulders
                        vertical and the top of its head facing the viewer. The figure's right arm
                        is bent and wraps around, holds, or embraces the figure to the right. The
                        bound figure faces right with her(?) head turned back to the left; the
                        figure's mouth is open and she looks at the bald figure with an expression
                        suggesting fear. Both arms are raised at 135 degrees and extend to the right
                        with the palms held nearly vertically and out away from her body. A nude
                        male(?) with short hair hovers or flies near the right border of the design;
                        he is seen from behind with his head bent back. The figure's legs are bent
                        and his right leg is drawn up to his chest. Both arms are raised vertically
                        and he may be reaching toward, touching, or holding onto the figure above. A
                        nude figure, probably female, with long hair flies or hovers near the right
                        border of the design. The figure appears in a contracted position with both
                        legs bent and her torso twisted down and to the right. The figure's head is
                        bent back and faces up; her hair is pulled down by the figure below or
                        possibly by the figure above. A nude male(?) with short hair flies or hovers
                        above the contracted figure. The figure's left arm is bent over his shoulder
                        and behind his back; he holds the left wrist of the figure below and may
                        pull it upward. The figure's right arm is down, probably holding the
                        contracted figure below. A gowned and old male with long hair and a beard
                        flies or hovers in the upper right portion of the design; he faces left with
                        his torso bent down and to the left. His mouth is open and he may be
                        speaking or howling. The figure's left arm is raised horizontally (relative
                        to his body) with the palm turned down. He may be wetting his left hand in
                        order to sprinkle baptismal water on the child he holds. His right arm is
                        bent and he holds or embraces the child to the left. The child faces forward
                        and bends backward and to the left. The figure's mouth is open and he or she
                        may be speaking or howling. The figure's right arm is bent slightly and may
                        reach toward or touch the bearded male. A gowned female with long hair flies
                        or hovers in the upper right corner of the design. The figure faces forward
                        and slightly left with her head turned down; her eyes are closed and she may
                        be smiling. Both arms are bent and she holds a plate or bowl with both
                        hands. The upper body of a female flies or hovers in the upper right corner
                        of the design. Her right arm is bent and she holds a pitcher with her right
                        hand. Her left arm is not visible, but her left hand may cradle the pitcher
                        from below with the palm turned up. The pitcher has a single curved handle
                        and pours liquid into the bowl or plate below. A dark-skinned, bat-winged
                        figure flies or hovers in the upper right portion of the design. The
                        figure's left leg is bent and the right leg extends to the right. A gowned,
                        bald male with a beard appears in the upper right portion of the design; he
                        may be hovering or flying, or perhaps sits on the bat-winged figure. The
                        figure's torso is twisted to the right with his right shoulder prominent.
                        His right arm extends to the right and he holds an open book with his right
                        hand. The bald head and left shoulder of a figure appear in the upper right
                        portion of the design, just left of the male holding a book. Two nude ghosts
                        (possibly children) fly or hover in the upper right portion of the design,
                        above the bat-winged figure. The figures' bodies are horizontal and they
                        hold a single lit candle; beams of light radiate outward from the flame. A
                        gowned and old male with long hair and a beard flies or hovers near the
                        upper border of the design, directly above the tree. The figure's body is
                        horizontal and faces down with his head to the left. His right arm is bent
                        back over his shoulder and he holds a knife or dagger in his right hand. A
                        nude male with short, curly hair flies or hovers in the upper left portion
                        of the design. The figure is twisted so that his lower body faces right and
                        his upper body faces left. The figure's left arm is bent and he holds a
                        small circular object, probably a ring, in his left hand. He may be offering
                        marriage to the female to the left; if so, the old man with the dagger may
                        be the female's angry father. The young man's right arm is raised
                        horizontally and extends to the left; he holds the left wrist of the female
                        to the left. The female is seen from behind and her hair is drawn back into
                        a bun; she is partly nude and wears a skirt or other drapery. Her right arm
                        is bent with the palm held vertically and out toward the man, as if to keep
                        him away. Her left arm is bent upward with the palm turned away from the
                        viewer and the fingers spread. A gowned female flies or hovers in the upper
                        left portion of the design; the figure's long hair trails upward, suggesting
                        that she may be falling or descending. Her body is positioned horizontally
                        with both legs bent and drawn up and her arms raised horizontally relative
                        to her body. She reaches for and apparently touches both the female above
                        and the female below. A gowned female flies or hovers at the entrance of the
                        church in the upper left portion of the design. The figure is upside down
                        and bends backward and to the left; she may descend into the church. Her
                        arms are only partially visible, but appear to be raised vertically with
                        respect to her torso.</illusobjdesc>

                        the 1808 edition. The backing mount inscriptions below the design were
                        probably written by Blake in brown ink, then partly over-written by another
                        hand in black ink; see Related Works in the Archive. This water color was
                        separated from its nineteen companions at an unknown time, probably in the

                        Information page). The design is listed in Cromek's first prospectus of Nov.
                        1805, but it was not published in the 1808 edition. A preliminary sketch is

                        is dark and she wears a veil over her long hair. The figure's left arm is
                        bent and her right arm is raised vertically with respect to her body. Both
                        arms rest on the ground; her right palm is turned down and the fingers on
                        her left hand are spread slightly. The woman's eyes are raised and she wears
                        an expression of grief or despair. Two figures stand or walk along a path in
                        the right half of the design. The figure to the left is a gowned female. She
                        has curly hair and wears a hat. Her arms are bent with the palms held
                        vertically in front of her chest; the fingers on both hands are spread. The
                        male figure to the right wears a shirt, breeches, possibly stockings, shoes,
                        and a hat. His left leg is bent with his left foot raised on tiptoe. His
                        left arm is raised at approximately 45 degrees; the palm is turned down and
                        he may point to the right. His right arm is obscured by the female, but the
                        position of his right hand suggests that it is also raised at 45 degrees.
                        His right hand is held down with the palm vertical and the fingers spread.
                        Both figures' heads are turned down and to the right; they looks towards the
                        widow below with expressions of surprise or pity. A low stone wall is
                        visible to the left and right of the couple. A Gothic church stands in the
                        upper central portion of the design. Two windows and a doorway with pointed
                        arches are visible on the building's facade. The roof is decorated with a
                        series of spires. The ground below the figures and gravestones is covered
                        with grass. Leafy trees appear in the distance to the left and right of the
                        church; the leftmost tree has a distinct trunk and visible branches. The sky
                        is filled with clouds.</illusobjdesc>

                    <p>The design illustrates the description of &quot;Friendship&quot; on pages 4-5 of the
                        1808 edition. The mount is inscribed, not by Blake, &quot;Friendship,&quot; below the
                        design. The back of the mount is inscribed, upper right, &quot;Not&quot;—probably
                        meaning not engraved. The design is listed in Cromek's first prospectus of
                        Nov. 1805, but it was not published in the 1808 edition.</p>

                    <illusobjdesc>Two male figures stand on a path in the center of the design; both
                        are seen from behind. The figure to the left has long, curly hair and a
                        short beard. He wears a long gown and a hat. His mouth may be open slightly;
                        he may be speaking. His left arm is raised and he points to the right with
                        his extended forefinger. His right arm is down at his side and he holds
                        hands with the figure to the right (or at least touches his hand). The
                        figure to the right has long hair. He wears a knee-length gown and a hat.
                        His right arm is down at his side and he holds a walking stick in his right
                        hand. Both figures stand with their right legs bent and their right feet
                        raised on tiptoe; they may walk away from the viewer. The path leads to a
                        city in the distance; the city is raised on a hill or mountain with cliffs
                        to the left. The buildings are decorated with multiple spires and pointed
                        arches possibly representing doors or windows; the architecture suggests a
                        Gothic style. The building furthest left may have a domed roof. Beams of
                        light radiate outward from the city. A large stone appears in the foreground
                        to the right of the two figures. Grass grows to the left and right of the
                        two figures. A vine-like plant with six small buds and some spiky vegetation
                        appear to the left. Another plant with two large leaves at its base and two
                        arched stems, as well as more spiky vegetation (perhaps grass), grow to the
                        right. Wash above the city indicates a cloudy sky.</illusobjdesc>

                <illustration location="E" type="plate">
                    <illusobjdesc>Five corpses lay supine in an ornate tomb. The ceiling of the tomb
                        arches above the central figures. The tomb is probably made of stone. The
                        figures lay horizontally on a woven mat; it may be made of straw. Their
                        heads rest on pillows to the left. The lowest figure is a gowned male with
                        long hair and a beard; he likely represents a counselor. His right arm rests
                        at his side and he holds a partially unrolled scroll in his right hand. A
                        seal dangles from the lower end of the scroll. The second figure from the
                        bottom is a gowned male with long, curly hair and a short beard. He wears a
                        crown and likely represents a king; his right arm rests at his side and he
                        holds a scepter with his right hand. The third figure from the bottom is a
                        male figure wearing armor and a plumed helmet; he likely represents a
                        warrior, knight or soldier. The warrior holds a sheathed sword with both
                        hands. His feet rest on the back and head of a sculpted animal, probably a
                        lion. The fourth figure from the bottom is a gowned female with long hair.
                        Her left arm rests at her side with her hand resting on the child above; she
                        is likely the child's mother. The child is gowned and has curly hair. The
                        left and upper walls of the tomb are lined with Gothic arches or small
                        niches, perhaps eighteen in all; at least four of these contain statues. Two
                        winged angel statues stand to the left and right of the oil lamp, facing
                        forward. Both angels are gowned and may have long hair. Their arms are
                        apparently down at their sides. The statue of a female(?) stands along the
                        left border of the design, left of the king's head. She has long hair and
                        wears a crown and a cloak or gown. Above and to the right stands a statue of
                        a gowned male. Both statues face right. Three Gothic arches appear in the
                        center of the upper wall, directly above the child; a shelf is recessed
                        behind the arches. An oil lamp burns above the figures on the shelf; the
                        lamp's handle forms a loop. Fourteen figures appear along the upper and
                        lower borders of the design; they may represent statues or carvings on the
                        tomb. Six winged angels appear above the arch of the ceiling. The figures
                        appear to lay prone against the arch; each has one arm bent upward in front
                        of its chest. Eight gowned figures appear along the lower border of the
                        image. The figures lay on their sides in a reclining position. Each figure
                        appears to rest its head on its hand. Vegetative motifs, possibly leaves,
                        appear in the upper corners of the design.</illusobjdesc>

                            He is very probably the soldier or &quot;Warrior&quot; named in the inscription on

                            large plume. A belt or sash is visible around his waist. His legs are
                            crossed at the knees with the left over the right; he may wear spurs.
                            The warrior's right arm is bent upwards and he grasps the hilt of a
                            sheathed sword with his right hand; his left arm is at his side and he
                            holds the sheath with his left hand. He has a mustache but is not
                            bearded. His eyes are raised. His feet rest on the back and head of a

                            stands along the left border of the design, left of the king's head. She
                            has long hair and wears a cloak or gown. Above and to the right stands a
                            statue of a gowned male. Both statues face right. Fourteen figures
                            appear along the upper and lower borders of the design; they may
                            represent statues or carvings on the tomb. Six winged angels appear
                            above the arch of the ceiling. The figures appear to lay prone against
                            the arch; each has one arm bent upward in front of its chest. Eight
                            gowned figures appear along the lower border of the image. The figures
                            lay on their sides in a reclining position. Each figure appears to rest
                            its head on its hand.</illusobjdesc>

                        The worm rests on the ground between the two figures. A male with short,
                        curly hair stands to the right with his legs spread apart. His mouth may be
                        open. He wears a shirt, breeches, possibly stockings, and shoes; there may
                        be two buttons on the left leg of his breeches. The figure's arms are bent
                        and cross at the wrists with his hands covering his chest. He faces left in
                        profile with his head turned down; he looks at the worm below. A Gothic
                        church stands in the left portion of the design. The roof is decorated with
                        several sharply pointed spires. A cross is visible above an arched entryway
                        and a single step is pictured below the arch. Two arched windows with
                        visible tracery appear to the left and right of the entryway. There may be a
                        statue of a gowned figure in a niche in the wall just within the entry to
                        the church. A path extends horizontally across the design from the entryway
                        of the church to the right border of the image. The ground below the figures
                        is covered with grass. A small flower or bud appears on the ground to the
                        right of the male figure. A mass of leafy, indeterminate vegetation above a
                        stone wall may suggest a distant forest of trees. A distant mountain rises
                        above a river, stream, or road to the right of the male character. Clouds
                        fill the upper portion of the sky. The disc of the sun appears on the
                        horizon between the male and female figures. Beams of light are visible
                        radiating from the sun; it may be sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc>

                            points to (and possibly touches) her cheek with her right hand. Her left
                            arm is down at her side and she points towards a worm with her left
                            hand.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The scene takes place in a room with an open window in the upper
                        left portion of the wall. The body of a muscular male figure lies partly
                        supine, partly on its side, in the lower half of the design. In the
                        inscriptions in Schiavonetti's engraving of the design, he is identified as
                        the &quot;Strong Wicked Man.&quot; He lies on a woven mat, possibly made of straw, and
                        a sheet or bundle of sheets. He is partly nude with a loincloth or sheet
                        covering his genitals. The figure's head is bent back and rests on his left
                        shoulder. The figure's legs are together and extend to the left. Both arms
                        are bent and rest at his side; he clutches at a sheet with both hands. He is
                        dying and may even be dead. A broken chalice or goblet appears to the left
                        of the corpse's left hand; liquid spills out to the left. A nude, muscular
                        male flies or hovers in the upper portion of the design. This figure
                        probably represents the spirit of the male figure below. The spirit is
                        surrounded by fire; the flames rise up and to the left and may pass through
                        the open window. The spirit is seen from behind and rises up and to the left
                        with his body nearly horizontal. His right leg is extended down and to the
                        right with his left leg bent and drawn up; the sole of his left foot is
                        turned out toward the viewer. The figure's head is turned to the left in
                        profile; his mouth is open and he wears an expression of surprise or fear.
                        The spirit's left arm is bent to the left with the palm held vertically; his
                        right arm is not clearly pictured, but his right hand is also held
                        vertically left of his head. A gowned female with long hair kneels or lunges
                        above the corpse with her body horizontal. Her mouth is open and she looks
                        down and to the right toward the corpse below; her expression and posture
                        suggest grief or despair. Her right leg is bent and drawn up; her left leg
                        extends to the left with her foot raised on tiptoe. Both arms are bent with
                        her hands positioned beside her head; her palms are nearly vertical with
                        respect to her head and her fingers are spread slightly. A gowned female
                        with long hair stands at the right border of the design. She faces left in
                        profile. Her left foot is visible below the hem of her gown. The figure's
                        head is turned down; her left arm is bent and she covers her face with her
                        left hand. Her posture suggests grief or despair.</illusobjdesc>

                        the sea. A sky with visible clouds is pictured above the mountains. The

                        design. The bier is covered with a sheet and the corpse rests on a partially
                        rolled mat or cushion. His body is horizontal with his head to the right.
                        The figure has curly hair and his eyes are closed. A gowned female with long
                        hair hovers above the corpse; she likely represents the male figure's soul

                        extended together down and to the left. Her head is turned down and she
                        looks at the corpse below. Both arms are bent with her hands held beside her
                        head and the palms turned out towards the viewer; the fingers on both hands
                        are spread slightly. Her mouth may be slightly open.</illusobjdesc>

                        is illegible. The back of the mount is inscribed, upper right,

                    <illusobjdesc>Fourteen figures fly or hover around a crescent moon; each figure
                        holds a continuous string or strand of thread. A nude female with long hair
                        appears in the upper left corner of the group. Her arms are bent upward with
                        her hands raised above her head and the palms turned up slightly; the thread
                        or string is wound around her wrists. A gowned female appears to the right.
                        She faces forward with her head turned to the left; she looks toward the
                        figure to the left and her mouth may be open. The figure's right arm is
                        raised vertically with the palm up and her left arm is raised horizontally.
                        Below and to the right, a gowned female flies or hovers with her left leg
                        bent slightly and her right leg extended down and to the right. The figure's
                        upper body bends to the right. Her right arm is raised vertically and her
                        left arm is raised at 45 degrees. Below, a gowned female faces away from the
                        viewer with her head turned to the left. Her left leg is bent back and her
                        right leg is extended down and to the left; the soles of both feet are
                        turned out towards the viewer. The figure's left arm is raised at 45 degrees
                        and her right arm is raised at 135 degrees. A nude(?) female with long hair
                        and a crown or wreath of flowers appears below the moon. Her body is
                        horizontal with her legs extended together to the left. The figure's left
                        arm is raised horizontally with the palm turned down; her right arm is
                        raised vertically. The figure's mouth may be open and her expression
                        suggests fear or surprise. Above and to the right, a gowned female is seen
                        from behind with her head turned to the right. The figure's left leg is bent
                        and drawn up; her right leg is extended to the right. Both arms are bent
                        upward with the palms held nearly vertical. Two gowned females hover or fly
                        above and to the left of the moon. The female furthest right faces forward
                        with her head turned to the left. Her hair is long and curly and her mouth
                        may be open. Her left arm is raised at approximately 45 degrees and her
                        right arm is bent across her chest. Six nude children, putti, or infants
                        with short hair fly or hover to her left and right. The female to the left
                        faces left with her head turned to the right; she may look at her companion
                        to the right. Her hair is long and may be curly. Both arms are bent; her
                        left palm is held vertically and her right palm is turned up slightly. She
                        holds the string or thread in both hands. The figure also holds under her
                        right arm a distaff with looped thread or string.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The scene takes place in a cave-like valley strewn with large
                        stones. Several stairs and a path wind between the stones; twenty-two
                        figures appear along the pathway. Several dark shadows appear on the stones,
                        particularly along the left and right borders. Distant mountains are visible
                        through the mouth of the cave in the upper portion of the design. Clouds
                        appear in the sky above the mountains. Two gowned females(?) stand in the
                        upper left portion of the design. The figure closest to the viewer stands
                        with her right leg bent back; the pair likely walks to the right. Both
                        figures are hunched over. The figure closest to the viewer has her head
                        down; both arms are bent and she covers her face with her hands. The figure
                        furthest from the viewer holds a walking stick in her right hand. A gowned,
                        bearded old man kneels or crawls at the top of a set of stairs in the upper
                        portion of the design. The figure is bent over with his left knee drawn up
                        to his chest. His left foot is visible below the hem of his garment. His
                        arms are down and both hands are on the ground with the palms down; he may
                        be bracing or supporting himself. A gowned female carries an infant below
                        and to the right of the stairs; only her upper body is visible. Her right
                        arm is bent and she holds the infant with both hands; she is likely the
                        infant's mother. The child sits in the female's arms, facing left. Both legs
                        are bent and its left arm is bent upward; the infant may reach for or hold
                        onto the female. A male figure with long hair appears to the right of the
                        mother and child. He is visible only from the knees up; he appears to be
                        running or walking to the right. His left arm is raised horizontally and his
                        right arm is raised at 45 degrees; both palms are turned out, away from the
                        figure's body. The figure may wear a shirt. Cloth or other drapery appears
                        over his right arm. The head and shoulders of a male figure appear in the
                        upper portion of the design along the right border, to the right of the
                        running male. The figure faces right and is hunched over with his head down
                        and his face in shadow; he may have a beard. A male figure with long hair
                        runs to the left in the upper right portion of the design. The figure's left
                        leg is bent forward and his right leg is bent back; his arms are raised
                        horizontally with the palms turned out, away from his body. He may look
                        towards the figures to the left. A gowned female and old male with long hair
                        and a beard stand immediately left of the running male. The female faces
                        forward with her head turned up and slightly right. Her arms are bent and
                        she clutches at the side of her head with both hands; her posture and
                        gesture may suggest grief or despair. The male figure faces left with his
                        shoulders hunched slightly and his head down. Both feet are visible below
                        the hem of his garment; he may walk to the left. His arms are down and he
                        holds a crutch in each hand; he leans slightly forward onto the crutches. A
                        gowned female with long hair stands below and to the left of the male with
                        crutches. She faces forward with her head turned to the left in profile. The
                        figure's arms are bent in front of her chest; her hands are held together
                        with the palms down. Her head is down and may rest on her hands. A male
                        figure with short hair stands in the lower portion of the design directly
                        below the male holding crutches. He walks to the right with his right leg is
                        bent and his right foot raised on tiptoe. His arms are bent in front of his
                        chest with the hands held together and the palms vertical; he may be
                        praying. A gowned female holds an infant in the lower right portion of the
                        design. Her right leg is bent back with her right foot raised on tiptoe; she
                        walks to the right. The figure is hunched over. Her left arm is raised at
                        135 degrees with the palm held vertically and the fingers spread. Her right
                        arm is bent and she holds an infant to her chest; she is likely its mother.

                    <illusobjdesc>Christ sits enthroned in heaven in the upper central portion of
                        the design above a series of steps or stairs; the structure may represent an
                        altar. A halo of light surrounds Christ's head with beams of light radiating
                        outward. His arms are bent and rest at his sides; he holds an open book
                        across his lap. Two gowned, winged angels kneel on stones or cushions to the
                        left and right of Christ. Both angels hold pens or quills and may write on
                        tablets or books resting on (stone?) pillars. Eight gowned male figures sit
                        to the left and right of the central throne or altar in the upper portion of
                        the design. Each has long hair and a beard and wears a crown; they may
                        represent kings. The four figures to the left face left and the four figures
                        to the right face right. The two figures closest to the center each has a
                        scoll resting on his lap. A pair of gowned angels flies or hovers above
                        Christ on outstretched wings; each figure holds and plays a harp. Six nude
                        infants or putti sit on a cloud above and to the left of Christ, and the
                        heads and shoulders of four old figures appear above and to the right of
                        Christ. Three angels hover or fly in the upper left portion of the design;
                        their wings are covered with small eyes or other circular designs. The
                        central angel holds a tray carrying two loaves of bread and two goblets or
                        chalices. The heads and shoulders of six figures appear directly below the
                        three winged angels; they may be hovering or flying. Below, three gowned
                        males with long hair and beards kneel on a cloud. The central figure's arms
                        are bent with the palms held together vertically in prayer; the figures to
                        the left and right cross their arms in front of their chests. A group of
                        indistinct figures appears to the left; only their heads are visible and
                        they may be seen from behind. Etched lines across the group may suggest that
                        they are in shadow. A gowned couple appears below; the figures face each
                        other and embrace with their arms bent slightly and raised horizontally. Two
                        gowned figures with braided hair kneel or crouch on a cloud below the
                        embracing couple. The figure to the left grasps the upper corners of an open
                        book while the figure to the right supports it from the bottom with his or
                        her palms turned up. Two gowned angels with short, curly hair fly or hover
                        in the upper right portion of the design; their wings are covered with small
                        eyes or other circular designs. The angel to the right holds a large pitcher
                        with both hands; the angel to the left likely holds the second pitcher.
                        Liquid pours from both pitchers into a bowl held by at least one of the four
                        nude children or putti below; the child furthest left is positioned with his
                        legs spread and his left leg extended backward. Three gowned females kneel
                        on a cloud below the group of angels. The figure furthest left may have her
                        breasts exposed; a nude infant or child stands below the figure and reaches
                        upward with his or her arms raised vertically. The central female cradles a
                        swaddled infant with her left arm. The female furthest right wears a veil or
                        scarf over her head. Her left arm is extended downward and she may touch the
                        hip of a nude child to the right; the child stands facing left with his legs
                        bent and feet raised on tiptoe. Two nude children sit or kneel to the right
                        of the gowned females; the figures embrace and may kiss. A group of
                        indistinct figures appears above the embracing couple; only the figures'
                        heads are visible and they may be in shadow. A nude child with short hair
                        flies or hovers below the female figures; the figure is seen from behind
                        with its body nearly horizontal and its legs extended to the right. Two
                        gowned figures appear in the upper right portion of the design, below and to
                        the right of the kneeling females. The figures face each other and embrace
                        with their arms bent and wrapped around each other; they appear to be
                        kissing. Two gowned males with short hair kneel on a cloud below the
                        embracing couple; the figure to the right holds the upper corners of an open
                        book while the figure to the left supports it from the bottom with his palms
                        turned up. Two bearded males kneel on a cloud below and to the right of the
                        figures holding a book. Three nude angels stand on a stone in the lower
                        portion of the design, directly below Christ; they likely represent
                        seraphim. Fire surrounds the seraphim and extends upward to the base of
                        Christ's throne or altar. Flames are also visible among the stones or
                        mountains to the left and right. The central seraph has three pairs of
                        wings. His arms are bent upward and he holds and plays a trumpet with both
                        hands. Two additional trumpets appear above and to the left and right of the
                        central seraph, each held by a single disembodied hand; the bells of all
                        three trumpets are filled with fire. The seraphim to the left and right have
                        at least two pairs of wings and each hold a sheathed sword. Four males
                        appear below the three seraphim in the lower portion of the design; the
                        figures may be partially buried. Only the head of the figure furthest left
                        is visible. The figure to the right turns his head up and to the right; his
                        eyes are raised and his expression may suggest fear. The figure third from
                        the left is seen from behind; his arms are raised horizontally and his hands
                        rest on figures to the left and right. The figure furthest right crouches or
                        kneels with his body horizontal and his head down. Both arms are bent upward
                        and wrap around his head and his hands rest on the back of his head. The
                        heads of two figures appear within a cave in the lower right portion of the
                        design. A serpent, lizard, or dragon appears in the lower right corner of
                        the design; only its head and a single leg are visible. The animal faces
                        right with its mouth open and teeth visible. A nude female with long hair
                        kneels or crouches in a twisted posture in the lower right corner of the
                        design; her arms are bent and at least her left hand may clutch at her head.
                        Six figures, or a single figure with six heads, stands in the lower right
                        corner of the design, above the nude female; the figure is seen from behind
                        and is covered with scales. Only the head furthest left is clearly visible;
                        a large curved horn grows from its forehead. Two figures lay on stones above
                        and to the left of the multi-headed figure. The lower figure rests upside
                        down with his arms bent to either side of his head; the upper figure's head
                        is down and the he appears to lie in a prone position on top of the lower
                        figure's left leg. A group of figures appears above the multi-headed figure,
                        extending from the right border towards the center of the design. Several
                        figures wear helmets and armor; they may be soldiers or knights. As many as
                        seven spears are visible, and a circular object directly above the
                        multi-headed figure may represent a shield. A gowned figure with long hair
                        stands third from the right. The figure's arms are bent upward with the
                        hands held beside his or her face; the figure's mouth is open and the
                        expression suggests fear. Further left, the figures become less distinctive
                        and only their heads are visible. A building with a domed roof appears in
                        shadow just left of the group. Eight nude males fall below and to the right
                        of Christ's throne; six of the figures are upside down, and five are seen
                        from behind. A snake is wrapped around the body of the lowest figure in the
                        group. The figure furthest right, probably a devil, hovers with his body
                        positioned horizontally and his head to the right. His right arm is wrapped
                        around the waist of the figure to the left; in his left hand he holds a
                        chain that may be attached to the other figure's head or neck. The upper
                        bodies of four figures appear in the lower left portion of the design, just
                        left of the seraphim; they may represent a family. A gowned female with long
                        hair appears furthest left; her right arm is bent and may rest on the rock
                        below. A gowned male with long hair and a beard appears to the right; he
                        embraces or touches the other three figures. Below, a nude figure of
                        indeterminate gender is seen from behind. To the right, a nude male faces
                        right with his left arm raised vertically. The heads of at least three
                        figures appear in the lower left corner of the design; all three face right
                        with their eyes raised. A nude couple sits or kneels on a stone in the lower
                        left portion of the design. The female (left) is seen from behind; her arms
                        are raised and likely wrap around her partner's neck. The male (right) holds
                        the female's left hip and right buttock. The figures' heads are together and
                        they are likely kissing. The heads of at least three figures are visible to
                        the left of the embracing couple; they face forward and slightly right with
                        their heads turned up. A nude female with long hair hovers or stands on a
                        stone to the left of the seraphim. Her right arm is bent and she holds a
                        nude infant against her chest; the infant's right arm is raised horizontally
                        and may reach upwards towards its mother's face or hair. The female figure's
                        left arm is raised at 135 degrees and her left hand touches a nude male to
                        the right. He is seen from behind and faces away with his head turned to the
                        left; he likely looks towards the female to the left. A gowned male with
                        long hair and beard stands or hovers between the two figures; his arms are
                        not visible, but the position of his hands suggests that they are raised at
                        45 degrees. Ten figures hover in the lower left portion of the design; they
                        may rise upward. A gowned female with her hair drawn back in a bun is seen
                        from behind and faces away with her head turned up and to the right; her
                        arms are raised vertically with the palms turned away from the viewer and
                        the fingers spread. Above, a nude male(?) with short hair holds his arms
                        down at his sides; his left hand may touch the female figure below. The head
                        and arms of a figure are seen from behind near the left border of the
                        design; his or her arms are raised vertically with the hands held together
                        in prayer. Above, a gowned female(?) with long hair is seen from behind; she
                        may be hunched over with her head down. To the right, a nude male with
                        short, curly hair raises his right arm vertically with the palm turned out
                        toward the viewer; his left hand touches or embraces the left hip of the
                        female to the right. The female's arms are bent with the palms held together
                        vertically; she may be praying. A gowned female with long hair raises her
                        right arm at 135 degrees with the palm turned out toward the viewer; her
                        left arm is only partially visible and appears to be raised at 45 degrees.
                        Two nude infants hover below and to the left of Christ's throne. The infant
                        to the left faces forward with his genitals exposed; the infant to the right
                        is seen from behind with his or her arms raised at 135 degrees and the hands
                        held together in prayer. A nude male with short hair hovers below and to the
                        left of Christ's throne; he is seen from behind and faces away from the
                        viewer with his head turned up and slightly right. Both arms are raised at
                        approximately 135 degrees and his hands are held together in
                        prayer.</illusobjdesc>

                        followers, page 29 of the 1808 edition. A preliminary sketch is in the
                        Victoria and Albert Museum (Butlin 624 verso). Blake based the basic
                        compositional format of the design on &quot;The Ascension,&quot; one of his biblical
                        water colors of c. 1803-05 now in the Fitzwilliam Museum (Butlin 505). The
                        design was not published in the 1808 edition, nor is it listed in Cromek's
                        first prospectus of Nov. 1805.</p>

                    <illusobjdesc>At least ten figures appear in the design; each is seen from
                        behind. A gowned figure of Christ flies or hovers in the center of the
                        design, facing away from the viewer; he rises above the other figures to the
                        left and right. His arms are raised at 135 degrees with the palms turned
                        slightly up and his fingers spread. Faint lines around the figure's head
                        suggest beams of light or a halo. A gowned female flies or hovers below and
                        to the left of the central figure. Her hair is drawn back in a bun. Both
                        arms are raised vertically with the palms turned out and up. A gowned male
                        with long hair and a beard appears to the left; his head is turned down and
                        to the left. The figure's right arm is raised vertically with the palm
                        turned out, away from the viewer. His left arm is down at his side; with his
                        lowered left hand he touches or holds the right hip of the gowned female to
                        the left. The female figure's head is turned up and to the right. Her right
                        arm is bent upward and she touches or embraces the bearded male. A small,
                        gowned figure, probably a child, flies or hovers along the lower left border
                        of the design. His or her arms are raised with the hands held together
                        vertically in prayer. A disembodied hand appears at the lower left border of
                        the design with the palm held vertically. A gowned figure with short hair
                        flies or hovers below and to the right of the central figure. The figure's
                        head is bent back so that the nose is visible. Both arms are raised
                        vertically with the hands together and palms vertical as if in prayer. A
                        gowned female with long hair appears to the right; her head is bent back and
                        turned to the left. Both arms are raised vertically with the palms turned
                        out, away from the viewer. A gowned figure with long hair appears to the
                        right. Both arms are raised vertically with the hands held together in
                        prayer. A small, gowned figure with long hair, possibly a child, flies or
                        hovers along the lower left border of the design. The child's right arm is
                        raised vertically with the palm turned away from the viewer; the left arm is
                        not visible. The figure's left leg is bent backward and the soles of both
                        feet are turned out towards the viewer. An indistinct figure may appear at
                        the right border of the design. Only the figure's gown, and possibly the
                        head, are visible, and he or she is likely seen from behind. A pointed
                        Gothic arch supported by two columns appears above the central figure. The
                        columns are topped with spires possibly including niches with sculpted
                        figures. Two winged angels, possibly statues and thus part of the
                        architectural decoration, appear just below the central arch. Both figures
                        are gowned and have a single visible arm bent upward. The figure to the left
                        faces down and to the right; the figure to the right faces down and to the
                        left. Half of two additional arches are visible to the left and right; each
                        arch is decorated with a leaf or other vegetative motif. Wash in the upper
                        portion of the design indicates sky. A large cloud appears to the left of
                        the central figure; a second, less distinct cloud is pictured to the
                        right.</illusobjdesc>

                        other food and a glass goblet or chalice appear on the table; rose wash on
                        the goblet indicates that it is partially filled with liquid, possibly wine.
                        The body of a male figure lays supine on a mat or bed in the lower portion
                        of the design; the body is horizontal with the head to the left. He is
                        identified in the inscription in Schiavonetti's engraving of the design as
                        the &quot;Good Old Man&quot;; he is either dying or may be dead. The figure has long
                        hair and a beard. His eyes are closed. He is gowned and a cloth veil or
                        other drapery rests on his head. The figure's right arm is at his side and
                        his right hand holds or touches an open book; the right page of the book has
                        a clearly visible text or inscription which reads, &quot;THE NEW TESTAMENT.&quot;
                        Seven figures appear around the old man, four at the head and three at the
                        feet. A gowned female kneels in the lower left corner. She is seen from
                        behind and faces to the right with her head turned slightly down; she looks
                        at the old man below. Her right arm is bent upward and the palm may be held
                        vertically; although her left arm is not pictured, she may be praying. The
                        upper body of a gowned female appears directly above the old man's head. She
                        may be kneeling or sitting. The figure faces left with her head turned down;
                        she looks at the face of the old man below. Both arms are bent in front of
                        her chest; her hands are together with the palms held vertically in prayer.
                        Two additional figures are visible to the left of the corpse; they may be
                        female. Both figures are positioned with their heads down and their faces
                        obscured. The figure directly above the old man's head rests her hands on a
                        pillow or bundle with the palms turned down. A gowned male with short, curly
                        hair kneels to the right of the old man. The figure's left leg is bent; his
                        right leg is not visible. He faces left in profile with his head down. Both
                        arms are bent in front of his chest with his hands held together and the
                        palms vertical; he may be praying. Two additional figures appear to the
                        right of the old man; both are positioned with their faces obscured. The
                        figure to the left may be seen from behind. A gowned male with long hair and
                        a beard flies or hovers between two winged angels in the upper portion of
                        the design; he probably represents the soul of the dead or dying man below.
                        His head is turned up with his eyes raised and his mouth open. His hands are
                        positioned to the right of his head with the palms held together vertically;
                        he is probably praying. The angel to the right is seen from behind and faces
                        away from the viewer. The angel to the left has long curly hair and looks to
                        the right toward the male spirit; the lower half of the angel's face is
                        obscured. The figures may rest on a large cloud extending horizontally
                        across the upper portion of the design; it appears to pass through the open
                        window.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>A partly nude male with short, curly hair kneels in the lower
                        portion of the design. He probably represents the &quot;Body&quot; named in the
                        inscription in Schiavonetti's engraving of the design. A cloth shroud or
                        other drapery covers his legs, but leaves his buttocks exposed. The figure
                        is seen from behind. His left leg is bent with the knee apparently on the
                        ground; his right leg is extended back and to the right. The figure's arms
                        are raised almost vertically with the palms turned up and the fingers
                        spread. His head is bent back and he kisses a female spirit, positioned
                        above. A gowned female spirit flies or hovers upside down above the partly
                        nude male; she is seen from behind and may be descending. The figure likely
                        represents the male's &quot;Soul&quot; or spirit named in the inscription in
                        Schiavonetti's engraving of the design. Her left leg is bent with the sole
                        of her foot turned out towards the viewer; her right leg is extended upward
                        and slightly right. Both arms are bent and embrace the male figure around
                        his neck; her head is bent back and she kisses the male figure. A dark
                        shadow below the male figure may indicate an open grave. A tombstone appears
                        to the left of the figures and a large tomb or coffin appears to the right.
                        Fire surrounds the tombstone and tomb. Two columns of clouds or smoke extend
                        upward toward the top left and right corners of the design, forming a
                        V-shape behind the two figures. Light wash respresenting sky appears between

                        lower border of the image. Leafy vegetation appears in the lower right
                        corner of the design along the right edge of the path or road. The door to
                        the tomb is open with a hinge visible along its right edge. Large straps,
                        possibly made of iron, secure the structure of the wooden(?) door. A
                        circular knocker or handle appears in the center of the door, and a keyhole
                        is visible below and to the left. The interior of the tomb is dark. A woven
                        mat, possibly made of straw, rests on a bier, bed, or raised platform in the
                        lower left corner of the tomb. An old man with long hair and a beard stands
                        in the lower portion of the design. The figure wears a belted gown and faces
                        left in profile. His left leg is bent with his left heel raised slightly.
                        His right leg is not pictured, but he likely steps up into the doorway. The
                        figure is hunched over and leans on a crutch positioned under his left arm.
                        The figure's left arm is bent at his side and he may hold or touch the
                        crutch with his left hand. The old man's long hair streams out to the left,
                        as though blown by a wind. A nude male with short curly hair sits or kneels
                        above the tomb. The figure faces forward with his head turned up and to the
                        right in profile. His mouth is open and his right eye is raised. Both legs
                        are bent; his left knee is on the ground and his right leg is drawn up. The
                        figure's left arm is at his side and is not visible below the elbow. His
                        right arm is bent back; his hand rests on the ground with the palm down and
                        he may be bracing or supporting himself. An aura surrounds the upper half of
                        the figure; beams of light radiate outward. Alternatively, the figure may be
                        positioned in front of the sun at sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Two gowned angels fly or hover above a family of seven. Their
                        wings may touch at the upper border of the design. The angels face towards
                        the center and look down at the figures below. A male and a female child
                        kneel or crouch furthest left. The female is seen from behind and faces
                        away. The male figure's arms are bent and wrap around the waist of the
                        female; her arms wrap around his neck and shoulders. The figures are
                        embracing and may also be kissing. A male and female adult couple stand
                        third and fourth from the left; they are probably the father and mother of
                        the children to the left and right. The father faces right with his head
                        turned down; the mother faces left with her head turned up. The couple are
                        embracing and kissing. His right arm is bent and wraps around the back of
                        the female; his left hand holds her buttocks. The female's arms are bent and
                        wrap around the male's neck; her right hand rests on the male's right
                        shoulder with the fingers spread slightly. A male child and female child
                        stand fifth and sixth from the left; only the male's upper body is clearly
                        visible. The male's arms are bent and wrap around the waist of the female
                        child; the figures are embracing and may be kissing. A male child stands
                        furthest right with his mouth open. He faces left with his right leg bent
                        back and his right foot raised on tiptoe; he may be walking or running. His
                        arms are raised at 135 degrees and extend to the left with the palms held
                        vertically; he may be reaching towards his mother and father. The scene is
                        set in heaven. Two vertical columns of clouds appear in the sky above the
                        figures.</illusobjdesc>

                    <p>The white horizontal line, most visible at the central figure's ankles but
                        extending across the entire design, was caused by the water color and its
                        mount having been folded at an unknown time. </p>
                    <p>The design does not illustrate any specific passage in the poem, but would
                        seem to represent a female personification of the grave, both the place and
                        the poem. The design was not published in the 1808 edition, nor is it listed
                        in Cromek's first prospectus of Nov. 1805. It might have been intended as
                        the &quot;characteristic Frontispiece&quot; listed in the prospectus, but its
                        horizontal format argues against that possibility. Inscribed, not by Blake,
                        &quot;The Grave Personified—Unfinished&quot; on the cardboard mount below the design.
                        The back of the mount is inscribed center left, &quot;Not&quot;—probably meaning not
                        engraved. The back of the mount also bears a light pencil sketch picturing a
                        figure in a posture similar to the woman in 
                        <hi rend="i">The Grave

                        , squatting and hunched over, with her(?) head between
                        very prominent knees. This sketch may be by someone imitating Blake. The
                        basic compositional format of

                    <illusobjdesc>The female personification of the grave sits or crouches on a

                        with her breasts exposed. Her hair is long and her eyes are raised. The
                        figure faces forward with her legs bent and her feet touching. Her arms are
                        raised horizontally with the palms turned down. She holds in each hand four
                        stems from which dangle the round heads of (opium) poppies. Two
                        butterfly-like or moth-like wings extend to the left and right; the wings
                        are decorated with scalloped lines and large, circular designs like the
                        &quot;eyes&quot; on peacock feathers. Two gowned figures sit to the left and right of
                        the personification of the grave. The figure to the left faces left with its
                        left leg drawn up. The figure to the right faces right with its right leg
                        drawn up. Both figures are hunched over with their heads down. Long hair
                        obscures their faces. Horizontal lines to the left and right of the central
                        figure may represent steps or stairs. The scene may take place in a dark
                        underground cave; shapes to the left and right of the central figure's feet
                        and lower legs (perhaps the lower part of her throne) suggest plant or tree
                        roots or branches, as do the forked forms above the hunched-over figures.
                        Flames rise from the lower border of the desing; the dark forms along the
                        left and right margins may be smoke.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>A gowned adult male and two gowned children kneel above an open
                        grave. They may represent a family, although the adult's garb and the burial
                        ceremony he seems to be performing suggest that he might be a priest. The
                        adult male (furthest left) faces forward and slightly left. His left arm is
                        bent and he holds an open book in his left hand. His eyes are cast down and
                        he may be reading or looking into the grave. The figure's right arm is down
                        at his side. The right hand is held open with the palm facing out towards
                        the viewer and the fingers spread; he may be gesturing or pointing towards
                        the open grave. To the right, a male child faces forward and slightly left;
                        his head is down and he looks into the grave with an expression of grief or
                        despair. The figure's arms are bent upward and he holds a portion of his
                        gown up to his face, covering his mouth. To the right, a young female faces
                        left with her head down slightly; she looks into the grave. Her arms are
                        bent upward in front of her chest with the hands held together in prayer. A
                        shovel and a lantern rest on the ground to the left of the adult male. A
                        candle burns inside the lantern; the flame is barely visible and an aura of
                        light radiates outward. Two leafy trees with distinct trunks and branches
                        stand to the left of the figures, above the open grave. A third tree rises
                        along the right border of the design; a leafy branch extends to the left
                        above the figures' heads. Dark wash in the upper portion of the design
                        suggests a night sky. A wind may be blowing from right to left, as indicated
                        by the adult's hair, streaming out to the left, and the bending trees to the
                        left.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>A cave or tomb of stone (the &quot;Grave&quot; referenced in the inscription
                        on Schiavonetti's engraving of the design) dominates the lower portion of
                        the design. A gowned female stands within the cave; the figure is likely a
                        representation of the soul. The figure is seen from behind and faces away
                        with her head turned to the right. Her hair is drawn back in a braided bun.
                        Both feet are visible and her left foot is raised on tiptoe; she is probably
                        walking away from the viewer. Her arms are bent and she holds a candle in
                        her right hand; the candle is burning and the flame creates a halo of light.
                        The figure casts a shadow below and to the left. She may look down and to
                        the right toward a corpse of a male(?) figure. The corpse lies on the ground
                        in a supine position, perhaps partly sunk into a shallow grave; the body is
                        horizontal with the head to the right. The figure appears to be gowned or
                        shrouded and wears a plumed helmet; he may be a knight or soldier. The
                        figure's eyes are closed. A fire burns above the corpse. A male with short,
                        curly hair stands above the cave. The figure is partly nude and wears short
                        pants. Both legs are bent and are spread apart. His body faces forward with
                        his head turned down to the left; his torso is twisted and bends to the
                        left. The figure's arms are bent to the right with the palms held
                        vertically. His eyes are cast down and he may be looking at the ground or
                        the figure below; his mouth is open and his expression suggests fear or
                        surprise. A series of distant mountains appears to the left and right of the
                        male figure. A crescent moon appears in the sky between the male figure's
                        legs. Two faint buildings, including a spire and perhaps a dome, rise below
                        the mountain on the right.</illusobjdesc>

                            the fingers spread. His eyes are cast down and he may be looking at the
                            ground or the figure below; his mouth is open, with teeth visible, and
                            his expression suggests fear or surprise.</illusobjdesc>
