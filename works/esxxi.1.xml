                The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of electronic editions of our first installment of Blake’s letters, the correspondence of his last two years, 1825-27, mostly with his friend, benefactor, and fellow artist John Linnell, who sponsored such projects as Blake’s engraved <hi rend="i">Illustrations of the Book of Job</hi> (1826) and <hi rend="i">Illustrations to Dante</hi>, on which he was still working when he died.
                <lb/><lb/>
                About ninety of Blake’s letters survive—an unknown fraction of the total. The surviving correspondence begins rather late in his career, in October 1791, the month before he turned 34, and ends, as far as we know, the month before his death at age 69 in August 1827—just three sentences to Linnell, to thank him for sending ten pounds and to indicate that his “journey to Hampstead on Sunday brought on a relapse . . . . however I am upon the mending hand to day &amp; hope soon to look as I did for I have been yellow accompanied by all the old Symptoms.”  <lb/><lb/>
                Blake traveled seldom and not very far, and he was little known beyond a small circle of British contemporaries, most of them in London.  His circle of correspondents was narrow and the geographical circuit small. But his modest body of correspondence comprises an absorbing, revealing miscellany of reports on work in progress alongside friendly and not so friendly exchanges on matters of practical and intellectual substance.  Occasionally they burst out into visions that amalgamate, in a characteristic Blakean vein, homely details, intensely energized prose, and inspired poetry.  <lb/><lb/>
                The letters are, in any case, indispensable in preserving facts and contexts for his life and work that would be otherwise unknown and in showing him shift pragmatically from role to role in a very natural—and human—way, exposing facets of character and personality not always so apparent in his art. The letters feel closer to the externalities of everyday life than any other work from Blake’s hand, and some start out to be one very ordinary thing and end up being another quite extraordinary thing.  If Blake is not an artist-thinker in correspondence with an international circle, he seldom puts pen to paper without interesting consequences for readers.<lb/><lb/>
                In his letter of 12 April 1827 to Linnell, Blake refers to a small card he plans to engrave for his friend of many years, George Cumberland.  An impression of the card is attached to the final page of the letter.  We are also publishing another impression of Cumberland’s card (see Separate Plates and Prints in Series, Designed and Engraved by Blake).<lb/><lb/>
                The Archive now contains fully searchable and scalable electronic editions of important manuscripts and series of engravings, color printed drawings, tempera paintings, water color drawings, and 85 copies of Blake's nineteen illuminated books--all in the context of full bibliographic information about each work, careful diplomatic transcriptions of all texts, detailed descriptions of all images, and extensive bibliographies. <lb/><lb/>
                Due to recent security concerns related to Java browser plugins, the Archive has disabled its Java-based ImageSizer and Virtual Lightbox applications. Users can still view 100 and 300 dpi JPEG images as well as complete transcriptions for all works in the Archive. Text searching is also still available for all works in the Archive, and image searching remains available for all works except those in preview mode. In the coming months the Archive will implement redesigned pages that restore the features of ImageSizer and the Virtual Lightbox without the need for Java.<lb/><lb/>
                As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with the University of Rochester, the continuing support of the Library of Congress, and the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.

He faces forward with his head turned slightly down and to the right. The figure is at least partly nude; traces of a skirt or other drapery cover his genitals. An aura or halo of light radiates outward from the figure's head and torso. His right leg is bent slightly and both legs extend down and to the left. The figure's left arm is raised horizontally and the palm of his left hand is turned up. He may be pointing to the right. His right arm is raised horizontally and he holds a sickle in his right hand. Three female figures fly or hover in the upper portion of the design. The figure furthest left has short hair or perhaps wears a cap. She faces forward with her head turned up and to the left. The figure is partly nude with traces of a skirt or other drapery visible at her right hip. Her right leg extends slightly to the left and her left leg is not pictured. Both arms are raised at 135 degrees and her palms may be turned up. The figure second from the left is gowned or at least wears a skirt. She faces forward and her long hair flows to the left as if blown by a wind. Her left leg extends slightly to the left and her right leg is not pictured. The figure's right arm is raised horizontally and her left arm is bent upward at 135 degrees; neither hand is clearly visible. The figure furthest right is gowned and has long hair. She faces forward with her head turned up. The figure's right arm is raised horizontally. Her left arm is raised vertically and the palm of her left hand may be turned up. A nude male(?) with short hair strides in the upper right portion of the design. He faces right in profile. Both legs are bent and spread apart, and he may run to the right. The figure's left arm is raised at 135 degrees. His right arm is bent back and he holds a stick in his right hand; the figure likely plays with the hoop pictured to the right. A figure of uncertain gender with short hair flies or hovers in the lower right portion of the design. He or she is seen from behind and faces away with his or her head turned to the left. The figure is partly nude and a (transparent?) skirt or other drapery covers his or her buttocks. The left leg extends to the left and the right leg is bent with the sole of the right foot turned out towards the viewer. Both arms are raised at 135 degrees; the figure holds a distaff in his or her right hand and a thread in the left hand. A spindle hangs from the thread to the left of the figure. Given the distaff, spindle, and thread, the figure suggests the classical Fate, Clotho, who spins the thread of life.  If this allusion is relevant, then the figure upper left (in spite of his gender) hints at the Fate Atropos who cuts the thread of life. A female(?) with short hair appears in the lower half of the design. She may be partly nude and wears a skirt or other drapery. Both legs are bent and the figure's left foot is raised on tiptoe. Her right leg extends backward, to the right. The figure's right arm is raised vertically and her left arm is raised at 135 degrees; she holds a string in each hand. The strings loosely connect to two birds flying above on outstretched wings. Perhaps the strings are snares that have caught the birds. A gowned female(?) with long hair kneels in the lower left corner of the design. Both legs are bent and her right knee rests on the ground with the right foot raised on tiptoe. She faces right in profile and bends forward with her head turned down slightly. Both arms are raised at 45 degrees and extend to the right. She touches or holds an object with both hands. This object may be a cage-like trap (to catch birds?) consisting of a net supported with a stick. Grain stems with visible tassels appear in the lower right portion of the design. The stems arch slightly to the right. Horizontal lines throughout the design indicate sky; white space in the center may suggest clouds.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="AC"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>partly nude</characteristic><characteristic>drapery</characteristic><characteristic>skirt</characteristic><characteristic>short hair</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>flying</characteristic><characteristic>hovering</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent</characteristic><characteristic>leg extended</characteristic><characteristic>hand raised</characteristic><characteristic>pointing</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>sickle</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised horizontally</characteristic><characteristic>palm up</characteristic><characteristic>halo</characteristic><characteristic>aura</characteristic><characteristic>beams of light</characteristic><characteristic>radiance</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>Fates</characteristic><characteristic>Atropos</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A male with short curly hair flies or hovers in the upper left portion of the design.
