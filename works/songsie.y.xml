            The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of electronic editions of two late copies of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi>, Copy V (Pierpont Morgan Library) and Copy Y (Metropolitan Museum), and a manuscript listing the order of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> (Rosenwald Collection, Library of Congress). Both copies are here reproduced for the first time, and, like all the illuminated books in the Archive, their texts and images are fully searchable and are supported by our Inote and ImageSizer applications.<lb/><lb/>
            Blake printed Copy V in 1821 in light orange ink on large sheets of J. Whatman paper watermarked 1818. He and/or possibly his wife, Catherine, drew four lines in pen and ink over or beside pencil lines to form a frame of three bands around each image; washed the frame's wide central band in light pinks, blues, yellows, or greens; and numbered the pages in ink 1-54 just outside the outer framing line. Copy Y, printed in 1825 in bright orange ink on J. Whatman paper watermarked 1825, is framed more decoratively with vines, curtains, and other motifs and is also numbered in pen and ink 1-54.<lb/><lb/>
            Both copies are connected either visually or bibliographically to Copy R, previously published in the Archive (see the update for 14 December 1999). Nearly all of the impressions of Copy R were printed in 1795 along with those making up Copy A (forthcoming in the Archive), and then, by August 1819, were refinished and given four framing lines for Blake's patron, John Linnell. Copy R established the plate order for seven of the eight subsequent copies printed between 1818 and 1827, including Copy Y and Copies Z and AA, both previously published in the Archive. The exception is Copy V, whose plates were uniquely arranged according to a manuscript entitled "The Order in which the Songs of Innocence &amp; Experience ought to be paged &amp; placed," often called "The Order of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>." Our reproduction of this manuscript is the first to be published since William Muir's partial facsimile of 1885, and our transcription and notes provide the most thorough textual and bibliographic treatment of it in any medium.<lb/><lb/>
            As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible through the continuing support of the Library of Congress, the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia, by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and by the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.

line by line into their midst, ending just over Adam and Eve's arched bodies.  An ascending bird

down the left margin.  Tendrils extending from both margins help separate the stanzas from one another.  But the vine full of leaves and flowers(?) that extends across the top of the plate above the title
and fills the top right corner and the space right of the first stanza is distinct from the flame-like vegetation that dominates the rest of the plate.  Extensions of letters in the title (line 2) contribute to both 
forms of vegetation: the initial "A" and "C" to the vine above, the "S" to both.  In the text of the poem, occasional letters have modest decorative extensions, and there are a few bits of stray decorative vegetation.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="object" location="E"><characteristic>sky</characteristic><characteristic>cloud</characteristic><characteristic>sunrise</characteristic><characteristic>sunset</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The background colors on the plate suggest sky with perhaps a cloudy area behind the text to set it off.

leaves (attached to the "H" and "L" of "HOLY" and the "S" and "Y" of "THURSDAY" [line 2]) and 
combinations of those with other long-leaved plants (especially under the title).  Many of the letters of the long-lined poem have decorative vine-like extensions.  After the area around the title, the 
most extravagant decoration is reserved for the spaces between stanzas, where rows of leaves and 
vines (most of them originating in extensions of letters of the text in lines adjacent to the spaces) 
alternate with an occasional bird (below "into the" in line 7) or human figure (beneath "innocent" in 
line 11).  Beneath the final stanza is another particularly busy area of decoration, dominated by 
vines and leaves but including a bird perching on a vine, wings outspread, facing the viewer. 
Some 
of the decorations are suggestive of birds (e.g., above "Seated" in line 9 and above "their" in line
11) or human figures (e.g., on the sprig of vegetation beneath the "Y" of "HOLY" [line 2]) but are more likely

most extravagant decoration is reserved for the spaces between stanzas, where rows of leaves and 
vines (most of them originating in extensions of letters of the text in lines adjacent to the spaces) 
alternate with an occasional bird or human figure.  Beneath the final stanza is another particularly 
busy area of decoration, dominated by vines and leaves.  Some of the decorations are suggestive of birds (e.g., above "Seated" in line 9 and above "their" in line 11) or human figures (e.g., on the sprig

Several varieties of vegetation fill spaces around the text and between stanzas.  The stanzas are separated 
by irregular vine-like structures that are sometimes extensions of letters (such as the initial "O" in 
line 11) or extensions of other vegetation (as between stanzas 4 and 5) or, sometimes, discrete
bits.  The initial "A" in the title (line 2) sprouts a plant-like structure on the left, while a loopy vine-like 
extension dangles down the left margin.  The
vegetation in the upper right margin—beside the "m" of "Dream" in the title—seems to be an arc of tasseled 
grass or grain that curves back over the title.  Beneath it—opposite stanzas 1 and 2—are three or 
four clusters of flame-like leaves or tufts of grass.  Below those are a bit of leafy vine (after line 11) 
and a branch or root of some sort (after line 14).  In the lower right margin—opposite stanzas 4 
and 5—is an odd tree(?) rooted in a small area of ground just below it (there appears to be a vine running across the bottom of the plate).  In front of the 
tree stands an indistinct figure, robed, wearing a hat, and holding a staff in his right hand and a rectangular object, probably a lamp, in his left.  He is probably the "watchman 
of the night" (line 18), the glow-worm of the text in human form.  He is one of four small and indistinct human figures on the plate.  The other three are in the area of the title: lying, presumably 
sleeping, on the left stroke of the initial "A"; sitting, probably reading, in the "D" of "Dream"; and 
floating or flying between bits of vegetation beneath the "e" of "Dream."  The animal life of the
poem appears in similarly tiny forms in the margins.  The insect life of the poem appears in tiny forms in the margins:
there could be an ant (the "Emmet" of line 5) crawling beneath the "her" in line 10,
and another to the right of line 5; a worm or caterpillar nestled in the lower right sprigs of
the vegetation right of line 7; and perhaps winged beetles (lines 20-21) flying right 
of lines 6 and 19.  A bird, perhaps an eagle, unmentioned 
in the text, spreads its wings above "dream" in line 3.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="D"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>watchman</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>robe</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>arm at side</characteristic><illusobjdesc>In front of the tree in the bottom right corner stands an indistinct figure, robed,

The two mourners are seen in profile facing left, their heads looking down toward the bodies, and 
holding their hands to their heads in gestures of distress, perhaps crying or in prayer.  The corpses are
arranged 
with their heads resting on pillows at left.  The visible (right) arm of the male is at his side. 
Except 
for their flesh-colored faces, the two might be taken for tomb effigies.  In the background is a paneled wall or partition flanked by pilasters—a cemetery wall, tomb, or church interior; on the 
right pilaster appears the ostensible date of publication, "1794" (line 5).  Above this structure, in a space 
colored to suggest sky and sunrise or (more plausibly) sunset, is the title, with its first and 
third words in heavy block letters.  In a lighted rectangle below the feet of
the mourning female is more publication information.  The rectangle is colored in a way that may
