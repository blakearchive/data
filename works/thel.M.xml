            <updatestmt>
                The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of digital editions of <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> copy C from the Morgan Library and Museum, copies E and K from Yale’s Beinecke Library, and copy M from the New York Public Library. They are accompanied by proofs of five of <hi rend="i">Thel</hi>’s eight plates (2-5 and 7) that form copy a in the Morgan Library.  These copies and proofs join copies B, D, F, G, H, I, J, L, N, O, and R. The Archive has now published all extant copies of this illuminated book except copy A in a private collection. 
                <lb/>
                <lb/>
                <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> is dated 1789 by Blake on the title page, but the first plate, which comprises the four questions of “Thel's Motto,” and the last plate, which includes ten questions emanating from Thel’s grave, were written in a different hand and appear to have been completed and first printed in 1790, while Blake was working on <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>. Copies C, E, K, and M are from the first of three printings of <hi rend="i">Thel</hi>, during which Blake produced at least thirteen copies, including copy A. Blake diversified his stock by printing copies in different inks; copy K was printed in green, copies E and M in raw sienna, and copy C in brown. All four copies were lightly finished in water colors and pen and ink. With the proof impressions of copy a, printed in black with enough pressure to pick up ink from the shallows, Blake was able to check the designs as well as the pressure of his printing press.
                <lb/>
                <lb/>
                Copies of <hi rend="i">Thel</hi> from this first press run were certainly on hand when Blake included the book in his advertisement "To the Public" of October 1793: "The Book of Thel, a Poem in Illuminated Printing. Quarto, with 6 designs, price 3s." Blake printed <hi rend="i">Thel</hi> again in c. 1795 (copy F) and 1818 (copies N and O). 
                <lb/>
                <lb/>
                With the publication of <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> copies C, E, K, and M, and proof copy a, the Archive now contains fully searchable and scalable digital editions of 104 copies of Blake's nineteen illuminated books. They are the first publications in the redesigned Archive, which is faster and easier to navigate, is aesthetically more appealing, and offers a more robust search feature. Users may view color corrected digital images of Blake’s works at their true size, and enlarge and rotate these images to examine the text and illustrations in detail. The images are accompanied by diplomatic transcriptions and editors’ notes, as well as illustration descriptions that make it possible to search Blake’s works for visual motifs. The Archive also provides full bibliographic and provenance information for each digital edition it publishes. Though the Archive retains its focus on the material conditions of Blake’s art, presenting images in the context of works and copies, such as <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> copy C, the newly designed site contextualizes each work, copy, and object in a network of relations. Users of the site can view each Blakean object alongside objects in the same copy, objects printed from the same matrix, objects from the same production sequence, and objects with similar designs. This contextualization, which draws on the expertise of the Archive’s editors, enables comparisons across time, medium, and genre, and foregrounds the immense variety and the recurring themes of Blake’s art.
                <lb/>
                <lb/>
                As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with the University of Rochester, the continuing support of the Library of Congress, and the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.

                    <illusobjdesc>A slender tree, entwined with a vine, arches protectively over the
                        title words and major pictorial motifs. This combination of motifs and their
                        position suggests a tombstone. Two birds and a human figure soar in the sky;
                        seven other human forms, one winged, rest or climb among the title letters.
                        Thel, wearing a long gown and holding a shepherd's crook, stands lower left
                        and casts a short, dark shadow in front of her (right of where she stands).
                        Thel gazes at a nude man embracing a woman around the waist. The latter
                        wears a gown and raises her arms. These small figures seem to emerge from
                        the large, bowl-like flowers lower center and right. The leaves of this
                        plant and a flower bud complete the design lower center and right. Green
                        wash beneath the large leaves at the bottom of the plate suggests grassy
                        ground. Streaks of blue wash behind and above the title area, and more
                        concentrated blue wash beneath the title and behind the three largest
                        figures, suggest a cloudy sky. The design does not directly illustrate a
                        scene in the text, but the figures embracing above the flowers may suggest
                        the "raptures" (object 5, line 12) of the Cloud and the "fair eyed dew"
                        (object 5, line 14) during their courtship.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Five human figures soar around the title-word "Thel" (line 1): a
                        nude man reaching toward a large eagle, a nude man holding a sword and
                        shield, and a gowned woman holding a small child in her outstretched arms.
                        Below, a nude man rests on the branch of a tree (or perhaps a tassel of
                        grain) and looks up toward the child. Spiraling vines and stylized flowers,
                        perhaps lilies, spring from several of the title letters. Blue and slightly
                        rosy washes above the text area, with a touch of purple at top left, suggest
                        a cloudy sky, possibly at sunrise or sunset. The design does not represent
                        any specific incident in the text, but the man with shield and spear may be
                        one of the "thousand fighting men" referred to near the end of the poem

                        birch or willow. She bows slightly toward the personified Lilly who, with
                        arms folded, bows more deeply toward Thel. Both females wear long gowns,
                        ruffled along the hems. A vine climbs lazily about the tree trunk. This vine
                        seems to grow from the plant right of Thel. The plant behind and to the
                        right of the Lilly is probably a lily, perhaps the St. Bernard's lily. Blue
                        wash above and left of the Lilly suggests a cloudy sky, and pale yellow wash
                        behind and around Thel suggests sunrise or sunset. Between the Lilly and
                        Thel, green wash rises in the background to about the height of the figures’
                        knees, indicating a small hill or grassy plain in the distance. The design
                        illustrates the dialogue between Thel and the Lilly given in the text on
                        this plate. The moment pictured may be their parting, when "the Lilly bowd

                        floats. The Worm, portrayed as an infant, rests in a bed formed by a lily
                        plant. Several flowers on a single stem are pictured just to the left of the
                        infant Worm. A tree trunk and a spiraling vine dominate the right margin.

                        two blossoms, one of which arches over Thel's head. Left of Thel is another
