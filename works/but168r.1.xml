  <updatestmt> 
The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of a digital edition of forty-seven monochrome wash drawings created by Blake between c. 1774 and c. 1786.  
<lb/>
<lb/>
The use of monochrome washes to tint a pencil or pen and ink drawing offered eighteenth-century artists several advantages. They could register gradations in tone, from the white of the untouched paper to jet black, without the more time-consuming use of actual colors. No further work was required if the wash drawing was intended as a preliminary for an uncolored engraving. A monochrome wash could also be used to underlie subsequent applications of water colors, thereby darkening selected areas to create the illusion of depth or cast motifs in shadow.  
<lb/>
<lb/>
As the works presented here show, Blake made full use of monochrome washes from his earliest years as an artist. When assigned by his engraving master, James Basire, to record tombs in Westminster Abbey c. 1774-75, Blake applied black and gray washes to tint many of his drawings (Objects 1-5). These carefully executed works could then be used as preliminaries for subsequent engravings by Basire’s workshop.
<lb/>
<lb/>
Blake’s monochrome washes during his first decade as an independent artist and engraver include several interrelated groups. The seven drawings of figures from Michelangelo’s Sistine ceiling (Objects 37-43) demonstrate how copying engravings of works by Renaissance masters helped Blake learn postures and gestures he would later use in his own compositions. Other drawings provide visual evidence of how Blake developed a design from early sketches to highly finished water colors or engravings. The recto/verso drawings, <hi rend="i">Two Sketches for “Joseph Making Himself Known to His Brethren”</hi> (Objects 34 and 35), are preliminaries for the finished water color in the Fitzwilliam Museum, one of three illustrations of the biblical story of Joseph that are among Blake’s finest pictorial works of the 1780s. The three Joseph water colors are in the Archive along with a water color preliminary for <hi rend="i">Joseph Ordering Simeon to be Bound</hi>. The evolution of one of Blake’s earliest original book illustrations, a frontispiece for Thomas Commins’ <hi rend="i">Elegy Set to Music</hi> of 1786, can be traced through three variant wash drawings (Objects 45-47) and a pencil sketch also in the Archive. The four wash versions of <hi rend="i">The Good Farmer</hi> reproduced here (Objects 16-19), in addition to two pen and ink drawings of the subject previously added to the Archive, show the complex ways Blake played variations on a theme as he worked toward a final version. No such finished work is known, and thus these drawings are our only record of Blake’s engagement with this subject. Similarly, for <hi rend="i">War Unchained by an Angel, Fire, Pestilence, and Famine Following</hi>, an untraced work Blake exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1784, we have only a preliminary study (Object 6).
<lb/>
<lb/>
Blake’s illustrations to his poem <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> of c. 1789 are among his most accomplished monochrome wash drawings. These have been published in the Archive as an independent group coordinated with the <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> manuscript.

                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>The drawing contains three figures: a woman, a male child, and an old man (presumably Matthan). Most prominent is the woman, who sits on a step or block that rests on the floor (or perhaps a low platform) in the lower right-hand corner of the frame. The woman faces left and sits with her legs bent at near-90-degree angles. Her bare feet point so that only her toes touch the ground near the block's left edge. The women's lower legs are also bare, but a sleeveless gown covers her from the thighs upward. The woman may have short hair, or she may have long hair that is gathered beneath the scarf that is tied around her head and that extends down her back. She leans backward, toward the right edge of the design, but holds her head erect as she gazes straight ahead, toward the design's left edge. Her mouth may open slightly. The woman extends her left arm horizontally toward the left side of the drawing, presumably to support the child in her lap. Her fingers point leftward as she does so. The child faces right, toward the woman, and kneels or lunges with his left knee on her right knee and his right foot planted on her upper left thigh. Both legs are bent at 90 degrees. The child's torso twists toward the viewer somewhat as his right arm bends backward. He places his right hand on the woman's left wrist, spreading his fingers to grasp her hand. The child's left arm extends horizontally toward the woman's face. He may touch her with his fingertips near eye level. The child leans forward, holds his head up, and looks at the woman. He has short, curly hair, and he is nude apart from a cloth that drapes around his hips and covers his left foot as it extends toward the ground. Between the woman and child appears the head (and perhaps the body) of an older man, presumably the Matthan of the title. The faintness of this figure--along with the absence of his feet--suggests that he may be an apparition. The man's head is covered by a hood or scarf, and a short, curly beard covers his chin. He faces forward and to the right, leaning his head toward the woman's as he looks at her with an expression of sorrow. The drawing's setting is unclear. The back wall, the floor, and the block on which the woman sits are all plain, and their material is undetermined. Prominent shadows appear beneath the woman's raised arm, around the child's legs, and on his face.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>Between the woman and child appears the head (and perhaps the body) of an older man, presumably the Matthan of the title. The faintness of this figure--along with the absence of his feet--suggests that he may be an apparition. The man's head is covered by a hood or scarf, and a short, curly beard covers his chin. He faces forward and to the right, leaning his head toward the woman's as he looks at her with an expression of sorrow.</illusobjdesc>
