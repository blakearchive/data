                    <illusobjdesc>A single figure shown in three-quarter length occupies this composition.  With torso and head twisted rightward to face the viewer, the male figure extends his left arm horizontally to the right, hand raised and palm out with fingers spread.  With his bent right arm, he grasps a sizeable staff, which he holds vertically.  The detail included in the figure's face and hair contrasts with the relative simplicity of the larger drawing.  His hair is short and curly, as is his beard, which tapers into two bushy spirals.  His brow is furrowed and his lips downturned, giving the figure an aged, angry appearance.  His eyes are blank, suggesting that the figure is copied from a classical sculpture (although no antique prototype or dependent engraving for this figure has been identified).  A diagonal strap is visible across the figure's torso and likely holds in place the cape or drapery billowing behind the figure at left.  He may also wear drapery around his waist.  The figure's lower body is obscured by a horizontal line that may indicate the decorated edge of a boat or, alternatively, the surface of water.  The presence of a boat would suggest this figure is Charon; however, the Blind Orion may be the subject, as Blake did a number of copies after antique sculptures for engravings.</illusobjdesc>
