"Triumphant Death" hovers above the stricken, his "Dart[s]" descending below each hand.  The curved form extending between his hands seems poised ambiguously between a bow and a scroll.  The figure far right, with a dagger in his left hand, may be a personification of Milton's "despair" who "tended the sick."</p><p>The back of the frame is inscribed by William Linnell, "This drawing by Wm Blake does not belong to the series of Mr J. Linnell Senr. but was bought by me of a dealer in London. William Linnell."</p></objnote><objsize>48.0 x 60.3 cm.</objsize><windowsize width="600" height="600"/></physdesc><illusdesc><illustration type="plate" location="E"><illusobjdesc>In the upper center of the design hovers a god-like figure, probably personified Death, in accord with the passage illustrated from Milton's <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi>.  His eyes are closed and he has an unusually long, flowing beard.  He hovers above or within a cloud.  Beneath his raised arms and hands appears a bow-shaped scroll with a coiled right end.  Three figures lie in pain on a heavy woven mat below Death.  There may be the chest (?) of a fourth figure lying on the mat, just beyond and to the left of the third figure.  We see the head and upper body of another figure proped up behind those lying on the mat.  All four or five are probably dying.  A figure along the right margin of the design stands, or walks towards the left, with his head hanging low, while holding a dagger in his left hand.  He may be a personification of "despair" in Milton's text.  In the middle distance, right side of the cloud, is a hunched-over figure whose hands clasp either side of his head.  Reddish hues around this figure and in the cloud hint at fire or a sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>God</characteristic><characteristic>Death</characteristic><characteristic>old</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>upper body</characteristic><characteristic>eyes closed</characteristic><characteristic>spiky</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>arms raised horizontally</characteristic><characteristic>hands raised, palms down</characteristic><characteristic>fingers</characteristic><characteristic>pointing</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>shirt</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>hovering</characteristic><characteristic>blind</characteristic><illusobjdesc>An old man with long, spiky hair and an unusually long, flowing beard hovers in the upper center of, or is hovering just above, a cloud.  We see only his arms, hands, head, enormous beard, and possibly something of his gown or long, flowing shirt between the lower locks of his beard.  This gown or shirt clearly covers his arms.  His eyes are closed, or possibly sealed to indicate blindness, and his arms are raised horizontally with his palms facing down.  A bow-like scroll extends between his hands; he may be holding it.  The downward-pointing thumbs of both hands are carefully delineated.  This god-like figure is probably a personification of Death, in accord with the passage illustrated in Milton's <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi>.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="object" location="E"><characteristic>cloud</characteristic><characteristic>arching</characteristic><characteristic>encircling</characteristic><characteristic>fire</characteristic><characteristic>sunrise</characteristic><characteristic>sunset</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A cloud appears below the top center figure, possibly supporting him.

His left eye stares blankly downward.  His skin is dark and slightly greenish.  He holds a dagger in his left hand with his forefinger along the blade.  His left arm is at his side.  The figure’s left ear is prominent.  He probably personifies "despair" in the passage illustrated in Milton's <hi rend="italics">Paradise Lost</hi>%5<illusobjdesc>The muscular male lying on the mat, closest to the viewer, is nude, with his genital area exposed but not delineated in detail.  While his head and upper body are bent towards the mat, the bottom half of his body (hips and below) faces the viewer; this is particularly true of the right leg, which lies in front of the left leg, crossing the left leg at the ankle.  The left arm is sharply bent upwards over his left shoulder with the fingers of his left hand spread apart.  His right arm is not pictured, but is presumably under his body.  His face, as well as his twisted posture and rigid fingers, express despair and pain.  He has long hair and his mouth is slightly open; perhaps we see some of his teeth or a bit of his tongue.  He is probably diseased and dying.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="CD"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>supine</characteristic><characteristic>arching</characteristic><characteristic>rigid</characteristic><characteristic>pain</characteristic><characteristic>feet</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>mouth open</characteristic><characteristic>teeth</characteristic><characteristic>despair</characteristic><characteristic>facing up</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>knees</characteristic><characteristic>head bent back</characteristic><characteristic>eyes raised</characteristic><characteristic>dying</characteristic><characteristic>disease</characteristic><characteristic>lying</characteristic><characteristic>legs together</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The second man from the front on the mat is nude and lies supine.

The back of his head with long hair lies on top of the mat.  His face is facing to the left, although upside down.  His eyes may be rolled back in his head, or perhaps raised, and he is probably diseased and dying.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="C"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>mouth open</characteristic><characteristic>teeth</characteristic><characteristic>tongue</characteristic><characteristic>howling</characteristic><characteristic>pain</characteristic><characteristic>despair</characteristic><characteristic>short hair</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>eyes raised</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent at knee</characteristic><characteristic>legs crossed</characteristic><characteristic>knee</characteristic><characteristic>left foot</characteristic><characteristic>lying on side</characteristic><characteristic>dying</characteristic><characteristic>disease</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>huddled</characteristic><characteristic>twisted</characteristic><characteristic>feet</characteristic><characteristic>leg drawn up</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Along with the two front-most figures, the third nude male from the viewer on the mat lies on his right side and faces the viewer.

His hair is between short and long; he may be bearded.  His left knee is drawn up towards his chest; is left leg may be crossed over his right leg.  Both feet, but particularly the left, are prominent.  He is probably diseased and dying, like his companions on the mat.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="C"><characteristic>upper body</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>rigid</characteristic><characteristic>arching</characteristic><characteristic>facing up</characteristic><characteristic>facing down</characteristic><characteristic>supine</characteristic><characteristic>prone</characteristic><illusobjdesc>There may be a fourth figure lying on the mat, between the left margin and the head of the third figure from the front.

He is probably half-sitting, half-lying, with his upper body propped up on his arms.  His right shoulder cradles his head, which is bent severely backwards.
