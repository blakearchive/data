            The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of 20 of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible. These designs illustrate the Old Testament and are arranged according to the passages illustrated.  They are presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).
            <lb/><lb/>
            The Bible had an enormous influence on Blake’s work as both artist and poet.  Among his many and complex responses to that text are water color drawings.  The present group of 20 is selected from a sequence of about 80 biblical water colors of similar size Blake painted for Thomas Butts between c. 1800 and C. 1806.  These designs emphasize interactions between the human and the divine.  In works such as <hi rend="i">Ezekiel’s Wheels</hi> and <hi rend="i">David Delivered Out of Many Waters</hi>, the interaction is revelatory or redemptive.  In other designs, including <hi rend="i">Pestilence: The Death of the First-Born</hi>, the relationship between God and humankind devolves into punishment and destruction.
            <lb/><lb/>
            This group of 20 water colors is the first installment in our publication of a large selection of Blake’s water color drawings illustrating the Bible.  In coming months we will publish a group of New Testament illustrations also from the series executed for Butts.  Later we will add early works, such as <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>, datable to c. 1780, and continue through Blake’s final biblical water colors, including <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi> of c. 1824.

Jephthah kneels in the bottom center of the design. He has short, curly hair and faces away from the viewer. He is partly clothed by a cloth secured around his waist. His arms are raised at 135 degrees. To the right of the central male figure sits a pot-like lamp from which emanates flames and curling smoke. Jephthah kneels in front of a stone altar with curved spirals on it, which make the top of the altar resemble an Ionic capital on a column or a scroll. On top of the altar kneels a nude female, facing forward. She is young and has long, slightly curly hair that is adorned with a crown, perhaps made of flower petals. Her arms are bent upward with her palms together, as though in prayer or supplication. She seems to look upward. She is Jephthah's daughter. To the right of Jephthah's daughter is a lyre and to the left is a tambourine. Extending to the right and left of Jephthah's daughter is a pile of palm(?) leaves or straw. To the left of the altar stand two female figures. Only the top of the downturned head and long hair is visible of the leftmost figure of the pair. The rightmost figure of the pair stands, facing right, though with her head bent down. She wears a gown and has long hair. Her right arm is bent upward and rests on the altar. Her bare right foot extends from beneath her gown. She may be mourning Jephthah's daughter. To the right of the altar stand two female figures. Only the downturned head, long hair, and gowned shoulder of the rightmost figure is visible. The leftmost figure of this pair has long hair and wears a gown. She stands facing left, though with her head bent down. Her left arm is bent upward and her left hand rests on the altar. Her bare left foot extends from beneath her gown. She may be mourning Jephthah's daughter. In the foreground is a strip of bare earth. The sky backing this scene is cloudy.
