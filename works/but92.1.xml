The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of a digital edition of forty-seven monochrome wash drawings created by Blake between c. 1774 and c. 1786.  
<lb/>
<lb/>
The use of monochrome washes to tint a pencil or pen and ink drawing offered eighteenth-century artists several advantages. They could register gradations in tone, from the white of the untouched paper to jet black, without the more time-consuming use of actual colors. No further work was required if the wash drawing was intended as a preliminary for an uncolored engraving. A monochrome wash could also be used to underlie subsequent applications of water colors, thereby darkening selected areas to create the illusion of depth or cast motifs in shadow.  
<lb/>
<lb/>
As the works presented here show, Blake made full use of monochrome washes from his earliest years as an artist. When assigned by his engraving master, James Basire, to record tombs in Westminster Abbey c. 1774-75, Blake applied black and gray washes to tint many of his drawings (Objects 1-5). These carefully executed works could then be used as preliminaries for subsequent engravings by Basire’s workshop.
<lb/>
<lb/>
Blake’s monochrome washes during his first decade as an independent artist and engraver include several interrelated groups. The seven drawings of figures from Michelangelo’s Sistine ceiling (Objects 37-43) demonstrate how copying engravings of works by Renaissance masters helped Blake learn postures and gestures he would later use in his own compositions. Other drawings provide visual evidence of how Blake developed a design from early sketches to highly finished water colors or engravings. The recto/verso drawings, <hi rend="i">Two Sketches for “Joseph Making Himself Known to His Brethren”</hi> (Objects 34 and 35), are preliminaries for the finished water color in the Fitzwilliam Museum, one of three illustrations of the biblical story of Joseph that are among Blake’s finest pictorial works of the 1780s. The three Joseph water colors are in the Archive along with a water color preliminary for <hi rend="i">Joseph Ordering Simeon to be Bound</hi>. The evolution of one of Blake’s earliest original book illustrations, a frontispiece for Thomas Commins’ <hi rend="i">Elegy Set to Music</hi> of 1786, can be traced through three variant wash drawings (Objects 45-47) and a pencil sketch also in the Archive. The four wash versions of <hi rend="i">The Good Farmer</hi> reproduced here (Objects 16-19), in addition to two pen and ink drawings of the subject previously added to the Archive, show the complex ways Blake played variations on a theme as he worked toward a final version. No such finished work is known, and thus these drawings are our only record of Blake’s engagement with this subject. Similarly, for <hi rend="i">War Unchained by an Angel, Fire, Pestilence, and Famine Following</hi>, an untraced work Blake exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1784, we have only a preliminary study (Object 6).
<lb/>
<lb/>
Blake’s illustrations to his poem <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> of c. 1789 are among his most accomplished monochrome wash drawings. These have been published in the Archive as an independent group coordinated with the <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> manuscript.

                    <illusobjdesc>A crowned female figure raises both arms horizontally and stands atop a mound of strewn objects between areas of dark clouds at left and right. A dark figure who may be a demon lunges left in the lower left corner of the design. The central female figure stands facing forward and turns her head up and to the left. Her mouth may be open. She has long, curly hair and wears a crown and a gown with a belt or ribbon beneath her bust. Both arms are raised horizontally with palms facing out and down and fingers spread. Her right leg is bent, and she appears to step on top of a stone (perhaps a tombstone) with her right foot. She may wear a shoe or sandal on this foot. Her left leg is bent and extended behind the stone or object. The area of sky around and above her head is brighter than the dark clouds on the left and right margins of the design. In the lower left corner, a dark-skinned or perhaps shadowy figure who is male faces forward and leans or lunges to the left. The figure has long hair and is nude above the waist, where drapery or a loincloth appears to cover his hips. Both arms are raised vertically, and his left arm is bent to the left over his head. His mouth is open, and his head is turned slightly to the right. His right leg may be visible above the knee and extended to the left. Many objects are strewn along the lower edge of the design and include, from left: a pitcher(?); an open book with visible, though illegible, text; a helmet(?), a chalice; the stone or tombstone on which the female figure steps; a cylindrical object; and, at far right, a flash glove in front of a candle (?). Shadows or darkness encompass the area across the bottom margin of the design.</illusobjdesc>
