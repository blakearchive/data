                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>A crowned female figure raises both arms horizontally and stands atop a mound of strewn objects between areas of dark clouds at left and right. A dark figure who may be a demon lunges left in the lower left corner of the design. The central female figure stands facing forward and turns her head up and to the left. Her mouth may be open. She has long, curly hair and wears a crown and a gown with a belt or ribbon beneath her bust. Both arms are raised horizontally with palms facing out and down and fingers spread. Her right leg is bent, and she appears to step on top of a stone (perhaps a tombstone) with her right foot. She may wear a shoe or sandal on this foot. Her left leg is bent and extended behind the stone or object. The area of sky around and above her head is brighter than the dark clouds on the left and right margins of the design. In the lower left corner, a dark-skinned or perhaps shadowy figure who is male faces forward and leans or lunges to the left. The figure has long hair and is nude above the waist, where drapery or a loincloth appears to cover his hips. Both arms are raised vertically, and his left arm is bent to the left over his head. His mouth is open, and his head is turned slightly to the right. His right leg may be visible above the knee and extended to the left. Many objects are strewn along the lower edge of the design and include, from left: a pitcher(?); an open book with visible, though illegible, text; a helmet(?), a chalice; the stone or tombstone on which the female figure steps; a cylindrical object; and, at far right, a flash glove in front of a candle (?). Shadows or darkness encompass the area across the bottom margin of the design.</illusobjdesc>
