Jesus stands in the middle of this design, facing forward, but looking slightly to the right. He wears a gown, with a belt at the chest, and has long, curly hair and a beard. An aura of light around his head suggests a halo. He bends his right knee and raises both arms horizontally, with his right palm down and his left palm up. This posture recalls his crucifixion. He is looking at God the Father to his right. To the right of Jesus sits God the Father in his role as a judge, portrayed as an old man with long hair and a beard. He wears a gown and sits, facing left, and presumably looking at Jesus. His left arm is bent and rests on the arm of the chair or throne in which he sits. His right arm is raised at 45 degrees and he holds in his right hand a scepter with a fleur-de-lis finial. His left foot is visible from beneath the hem of his gown. Only the left arm of the throne or chair in which God sits is visible. An angel kneels below God the Father, facing left and hunched over so that he looks down. He wears a gown and has wings and long, slightly curly hair. His arms are bent and his hands are held together as if in prayer or supplication. To the left of Jesus stands Mary Magdalene, facing right and forward. She bends forward into a bow. She wears a gown and has long, curly hair. Her right leg is bent and her right foot is on tiptoe, suggesting that she is walking to the right or about to kneel. Her arms are raised, with her hands folded together on her chest—a gesture that suggests supplication. Surrounding Mary Magdalene are six child-like angels or cherubs, two to the left, one above her, and three to the right. The leftmost angel is seen from behind, though he twists his head to face left. He wears a gown and has wings and long, curly hair. His right leg is extended backward. The middle angel to the left of Mary Magdalene faces right and hovers in mid-air. He wears a gown and has wings. His right arm is bent upward. He may cover his face with his hands or arms, since it is not visible. He may be praying. The angel above Mary Magdalene faces right and down, as though bowing. He wears a gown and has wings and long, curly hair. His arms are bent upward and his mouth may be slightly open. He also floats or hovers in mid-air. The lower angel to the right of Mary Magdalene may hover or stand. This angel appears to be a female child. She faces forward, with her arms raised and her hands together as if in prayer or supplication. She appears to look up at Mary Magdalene. She wears a gown and has wings as well as long hair. The middle angel to the right of Mary Magdalene faces away, though he(?) looks up at Mary Magdalene. His mouth may be open and thus he may be speaking. The wings and long hair of this angel are visible. The upper angel to the right of Mary Magdalene faces forward and may look at Mary Magdalene. Its mouth may be slightly open. This angel's curly hair is visible, but little else besides its head and upper body. This scene takes place in heaven, but the background is dark with the exception of Jesus's aura. Flames wrap from God the Father's feet to the left and above his head along the top margin of the design, and extend to the end of Jesus's right hand.
