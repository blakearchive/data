The child Jesus kneels on a bed in the lower part of the image. He has short, curly hair and is gowned. He may also have a halo around his head. He faces right and looks up slightly. His arms are at his sides but bent with his hands held together in prayer. His legs may be crossed underneath him, with his left foot visible. The bed Jesus kneels on appears to be covered in sheets or blankets. The scene takes place in a darkened room with a wooden plank floor, nails visible in the ends of the planks. A radiance, perhaps indicating the divine presence, illuminates the top center of the image and casts shadows on the sides, particularly the lower right corner. Four gowned and winged male angels kneel around Jesus's bed, one at each corner; they each appear to be praying, hands together. The angel at the front left corner has short curly hair and bends forward, facing right and looking down. His right arm is at his side but bent upward. The angel in the back left corner has slightly long, curly hair and bends forward, facing right and slightly forward. He may be looking down or his eyes may be closed; his mouth may be slightly open. The angel in the front right corner has slightly long, flame-like hair. He faces left and bends forward, looking down. His left arm is at his side and bent upward. His left foot is visible beneath the hem of his gown. The angel in the back right corner has curly hair and faces left, bending forward and looking down, with at least his left hand near or touching his face. To the right of the rightmost kneeling angels kneel two gowned adults, very probably Mary and Joseph. Mary is the leftmost figure of the pair. Mary has long hair and covers her head with a veil or scarf. She faces left and turns her head to look down and forward. Her left arm is at her side but bent upward, hands together, in a gesture of prayer. Joseph is the rightmost figure of the pair. He has short, curly hair and a beard. He faces left but turns his head to look down and forward. His his left arm is at his side but bent upward, hands together and touching his forehead in a gesture of prayer. Above Mary and Joseph hover two gowned and winged angels, facing left and looking down, presumably at Jesus. Both of these angels have their hands together in a gesture of prayer. They may both be male. The leftmost angel of the pair has short, curly hair and faces slightly forward. His left arm, and very probably his right, is at his side and bent upward. The rightmost angel has slightly long hair and a particularly long gown, the hem of which fills the bottom right corner of the image in a swirling pattern. His left arm is at his side but bent upward.
