            The editors of the William Blake Archive are pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi>, Copy Z. It joins editions of three copies of <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> and two copies of <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi>. In the next week, these works will be joined by <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>, Copy D, <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen</hi>, Copy G, <hi rend="i">America, a Prophecy</hi>, Copy E, and <hi rend="i">Europe, a Prophecy</hi>, Copy B. All of these editions have newly edited texts and were scanned from 4x5 color transparencies made specifically for the Archive. They are all fully searchable for both text and images and are supported by the unique Inote and ImageSizer applications described in our previous updates.<lb/><lb/><hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> Copy G and <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> Copy Z were produced in Blake's late printing and coloring styles, c.1818 and c. 1826 respectively. <hi rend="i">America</hi> Copy E is a monochrome copy from 1793; <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> Copy B was color printed in 1794, and <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> Copy D was produced in 1795 on large paper and with some rudimentary color printing.<lb/><lb/>
            We will be adding second and third copies of most illuminated books in the coming months, with the goal of having the entire illuminated canon online later this year. In addition, work continues on the SGML edition of David V. Erdman's <hi rend="i">Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</hi>, which we anticipate releasing sometime this spring.

forward and to the left.  He faces left and holds a walking-stick

Blake's representations of a traveler.  Below his feet is a path

particularly in the margins of the text.  Most consists of vines 
and leaves, but there are also a few animals.  The first letter 
of the first word in line 3 twists into a spiral vine on the left; it (or another, detached vine) descends with one further loop in the left margin to line 11.  A long, wavy vine extends between lines 5 and 6.  On it is a 
long-legged spider, just above "other sons" in line 6, and possibly a caterpillar left of the spider.
Further to the left, under the first word of line 5, is a small 
form that may be a fly, moth, or butterfly.  A vine trails 
downward from this same first word ("And") in line 5.  Just left of the beginning of line 14 is a 
flying creature, perhaps an insect of some sort.  In the bottom 
left corner of the plate, a vine descends from the first letter 
of the first word in the last line of text (line 17).  In the right margin, 
another branch of the vine extending between lines 5 and 6 descends from the design above the text all the way to the lower 
margin.  It bears loops, at least two types of leaves, and perhaps some fruit or flowers.  A butterfly sits on the upper reaches of this vine (opposite line 5); a worm or caterpillar inches its way across the upper reaches of a large, slender leaf opposite the space between lines 9 and 10.  Other branches of this vine extend above the falling figure and intertwine with the large leaf to the right of this same figure.  To the right are two flying birds.  A separate vine with spiky leaves twists right of lines 6 and 7, growing from the "d" in "thunder."  Below one of its tendrils, and just to the right of line 9, is a flying insect, perhaps a beetle or fly.  A somewhat 
jagged vine extends horizontally following line 8; to the right 
is another vine, growing from the top of the second letter of 
"of" in line 9.</illusobjdesc><component type="animal" location="D"><characteristic>butterfly</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A butterfly sits on the upper reaches of the vine

treated as a full-page design showing four nude males in a dark 
sky, perhaps at night.  The two text panels are shaped like 
clouds.  Upper right, we see a figure from behind with his left 
leg bent and his left foot poised on a dark brown cloud extending 
down and to the left.  His right leg is extended; he may be 
rising.  We do not see his arms, but his hands clutch his head.  
This gesture suggests despair.  His hair may be curly.  Below is 
a group of three wrestling figures, all nude and bald.  The 
central figure has his legs spread, with his left leg extended 
and his right bent at the knee with his right foot below his 
prominent (if somewhat abstractly rendered) genitals.  He looks 
down and to the right. With his right arm he grasps another bald 
nude around the neck, apparently in an attempt to strangle him.  
This central figure's left arm is bent at the elbow and he grasps 
the neck of another bald nude with his left hand.  The blue-green 
coloring of this figure suggests that the central male has been 
successful in strangling this figure on the right.  The figure on 
the left has his legs spread and bent at the knees.  He looks up 
and to the right and tries, with both hands, to release the 
central male's arm from around his neck.  The wrestler on the 
right has his legs spread, with his left leg extended vertically 
and his right leg bent at the knee.  His arms are bent back over 
his shoulders and grasp the left leg of the central male.  All 
three figures have caricature-like facial expressions suggesting fear and pain (figures right and left) or desperation and cruelty (central figure).

a great deal of interlinear decoration, the major pictorial 
motifs—the sky and the two largest figures—constitute a full- 
plate design.  The three text panels are shaped like, and may 
represent, clouds floating in the sky.  The largest figure, 
hovering horizontally in the air just below the heading, is a 
gowned female.  The hem of her garment forms a snake-like tail.  Her body is twisted, facing forward below the waist and facing down above the waist.  Her long, curled hair cascades over (and 
hence obscures) her face.  Her arms are bent at the elbows and 
her hands are clasped behind her head.  She has large 
wings, and thus may be an angel.  More specifically, in the 
context of this poem, she has been identified as Enitharmon, a 
nature goddess of fallen time and space, and as the "nameless 
shadowy female" (Plate 3, line 3) who wraps a 
"turban of thick clouds" around her "lab'ring head" (Plate 3, line 14).  Below 
her cascading hair is a nude, youthful male in a contracted 
posture.  He seems confined by the circle in which he sits.  This 
circle may be meant to represent a globe; it has been described 
as a comet, although there is no tail.  It may be a planet.  His 
legs are bent at the knees and drawn up to his chest; his arms 
are bent at the elbows with his hands, formed into fists, against 
his cheeks just below his eyes.  He faces forward.  Flames surround him within the globe.  This may be Orc, the spirit of revolution here confined, 
the "secret child" (of Enitharmon?) mentioned on the plate (line 5), 
or one of Enitharmon's "vig'rous progeny of fires" (Plate 4, line 9).

vegetative motifs.  The figures, particularly the larger ones, 
may be the "sons &amp; daughters" (line 8) of Enitharmon referred to on 
the plate.  The lower left corner of "A" (in "A / PROPHECY" [lines 2-3]) grows 
into a long vine with branches.  Standing on this vine, near the 
left foot of the letter, is a human figure facing forward.  His 
or her arms, raised vertically, grow into limbs of a tree that 
bend downwards, as with a willow.  The motif suggests the 
classical myth of Daphne and her vegetating metamorphosis.  This 
parallel suggests that the figure is female.  On the right foot 
of "A" is a tree, possibly a palm, with branches that bend 
downward.  To the left of the "A" and slightly below it is a male(?) 
embracing a female.  Both hover in the air, with the male on the 
right and facing to the left.  Both have long hair and appear 
nude, although the woman has a long, snake-like tail of drapery 
extending from her right leg.  The man's body is twisted into a 
curve, seen from behind.  His left arm is raised horizontally and 
embraces the woman's waist.  His right leg is extended 
horizontally.  We also see the woman from behind, with her body 
twisted into a curve matching the man's.  Both her arms are 
raised horizontally, with her head facing down.  These gestures 
suggest that she is trying to escape from the man.  In contrast, 
the couple right of the letter "A" is embracing mutually and 
appear to be kissing.  The winged male(?), possibly an angel, hovers 
horizontally in the air, with his arms raised at 45 degrees to 
embrace the woman(?) who hovers vertically.  She too is winged and 
may be an angel.  Her legs are bent back and her arms raised at 
135 degrees to embrace her companion.  He faces down and to the 
left; she faces up and to the right.  Below the "A" is a hunched 
over, and apparently gowned, figure facing to the left.  This 
extremely contracted figure, with his or her upper body and head 
bent down to touch the upper legs, sits on a cloud outline.  
Other cloud outlines extend to the upper right and below 
"PROPHECY" in the heading.  On the right, below a cloud outline 
and above the last letter of "PROPHECY," two nude figures seen 
from behind soar in the sky, left arms raised horizontally and 
right arms raised at 135 degrees.  The letters of "PROPHECY" are 
well decorated with eight human figures and vines.  Proceeding 
from left to right, these include a vine with leaves or lily-like 
flowers intertwined with the first letter and extending to the 
second.  A small standing figure holds the vertical of the first "P," 
and what may be another figure dangles from the base of the letter.  
Another figure stands on the foot of the vertical of the 
"R" and faces to the left with arms raised vertically.  Above 
this figure is a small form that may be a descending child or 
infant, arms stretched downward toward the adult.  The right foot 
of the "R" bears a very small seated figure, hunched over and 
facing to the right.  The letter "O" has two vines with lily-like 
flowers.  Standing within the "O" is a figure facing forward and 
with left arm raised horizontally to hold a shepherd's crook.  To 
the right of this shepherd is a small flock of sheep.  Three 
vines, or perhaps flames, spring from the foot of the second "P." 
A vine, perhaps with a few leaves, is intertwined with the next 
three letters ("HEC").  The final vine in this group springs from 
the foot of the final letter and forms a spiral above and to the 
right of the letter.  This "Y" also bears three human figures.  
One, seen from behind and with legs spread and arms raised 
vertically, seems to be climbing, with the right foot on the foot 
of the "Y" and the left foot on the "C."  Above, standing on the 
top left end of the "Y," is a figure facing left who seems to 
lean against a pole, with left arm raised horizontally and right 
arm raised vertically, or a somewhat larger figure walking to the left.  Finally, the first bend in the vine 
growing from the right side of the final letter bears a seated 
figure facing right, with back slightly hunched over and right 
arm extended to the right knee.  This figure holds a book or 
tablet and is probably reading.  Two flames, or perhaps a
flame-like plant, spring from the foot of the "Y" on its right
side.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="AB"><characteristic>group of figures</characteristic><characteristic>Enitharmon's son</characteristic><characteristic>Enitharmon's daughter</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The human figures surrounding the heading,

is twisted dramatically at the waist, with his legs together, his 
head down, and his arms raised and wrapped around his head.  He 
appears to be bald.  Right of line 5 are four flying creatures.  
Reading left to right, these are a bird, a winged insect (perhaps 
a beetle or moth), a butterfly or moth, and a bird.  Another 
winged creature, perhaps an insect, flies right of lines 8-9.  Left 
and right of this creature are two vines; the vine on the right looks very worm-like.  A vine below line 10 
includes one loop and a grain tassel on its right end.  A 
grasshopper or locust stands on this vine, facing right.  Three 
winged insects fly above the grain tassel.  Another vine appears 
further to the right, with at least one leaf and three loops.  
Vines, or extensions of a cloud outline, extend below line 15.  A

long and her arms are at her side.  Her face, with mouth open like 
her companion’s, expresses despair and perhaps pain, and the limp 
posture of her body indicates that she may be weak with plague.  The 
green color of the man's and woman's skin suggests that they are 
suffering from the plague.  To the right, a gowned woman with 
long hair seems to be falling on her knees.  Her arms are raised

along the right margin, extends between lines 21 and 22 of the 
text, and fills the bottom margin of the plate.  Top right is a 
dense mass of lines that apparently represents a web; the other 
webs are more clearly pictured with finer lines.  At least five 
spiders appear on the web: right of lines 15-17, right of line 
20, in a dense web below the first word ("Fled") in line 21, 
above "wide" in line 24, and right of lines 29-31 (dangling on a 
single thread).  What may be a sixth spider appears above "&amp; 
louder" at the end of line 15.  A great many insects appear in 
the design, although some are simply suggested by little more 
than dots.  The larger and more identifiable insects are a winged 
insect right of lines 11-13, a fly or butterfly further to the 
right and just below the mass of lines in the top right corner, a 
fly below this insect, four flies (two very small) right of lines 
15-17, a large winged insect (a beetle?) right of line 21 and 
half-way to the right margin, a caterpillar below and to the left 
of this last insect, another winged fly or beetle above and to 
the right of the spider between lines 21 and 22, and a large fly 
or beetle (and a cluster of very small insects) below "he drag'd" 
in line 21.  The landscape below the text is filled with heavy 
vegetation, including low plants with large leaves and a vine 
with one loop and three large leaves intertwined with the spider 
web in the lower right corner.  Just to the left is a nude figure, of uncertain gender, sitting on the ground and completely covered by a fine net or web.  The legs are bent at the knees and the body is twisted so that the figure faces forward.  The head is bent back and she or he looks up.  The upper body is braced up on the elbows.  The hands are held together in an attitude of supplication or prayer.  This figure may relate to the image of "every man bound" (line 27).</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="D"><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>sitting</characteristic><characteristic>legs bent</characteristic><characteristic>twisted</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing up</characteristic><characteristic>head bent back</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>arms braced</characteristic><characteristic>hands together</characteristic><characteristic>praying</characteristic><characteristic>supplicating</characteristic><characteristic>net</characteristic><characteristic>web</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A nude figure, of uncertain gender, sits on the ground and is completely covered by a fine net or web.

caterpillars (above and to the right of line 15 and right of

smaller birds or insects fly near the right margin of the plate 
right of lines 19-21.  A vine with many loops fills the 
considerable space between lines 21 and 22 and descends in the 
right margin to line 27.  On this vine are at least two large and 
two small caterpillars, an inch-worm, two snails, at least three 
spiders, at least two insects with wings folded, and a bird perched near the right margin with its mouth open (because it is singing?).  The odd shape within the loops of the vine to the left might be another bird.  A large moth or butterfly appears below "Antamon" in line 21.  A flying insect is pictured far to the right of line 24.  Below and to the left is a large bird (possibly an 
eagle) soaring upwards, with a flock of six birds to the left.  
The form right of lines 27-31 probably represents the sky.  A 
vine descends from the second letter of "my" in line 26.  A vine

a bird perches on the vine but spreads its 
wings as if about to fly into the air.  An oak or grape leaf grows into the left margin from the first letter of the first word of line 4.  A vine with ivy-like 
leaves extends horizontally between lines 9 and 10, divides into 
several branches in the right margin, and has one branch arching 
back to the left at line 7.  A branch bearing five oak leaves and 
one acorn extends into the right margin following the final line
