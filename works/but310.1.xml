The closed eye of the horse suggests that Blake has transposed sightlessness from the observer (one who cannot see the wind) to the observed (blind horses).  The design would seem to be a positive image of compassion, but some of Blake's writings of the 1790s indicate that it is only the useless product of a fallen condition.  As he writes in "The Human Abstract" in *Songs of Experience*, "Pity would be no more,/ If we did not make somebody Poor" (Erdman page 27).</p></objnote><objsize>42.5 x 53.9 cm.</objsize><windowsize width="600" height="550"/></physdesc><related objectid="but313.1.cprint.01"/><illusdesc><illustration type="plate" location="E"><illusobjdesc>Two figures, one of whom holds a baby, ride back-to-back on horses and soar above a supine woman below.  The front horse extends at least one front leg, and both hind legs, horizontally in a posture suggestive of leaping, striding, or flying.  We see only one extended hind leg of the second horse, mostly covered by the front-most horse.  Their mouths are open, and the mouth of the front-most horse contains a bit attached to a rein that loops over its neck.  The manes of the horses (or at least the mane of the front-most horse) fly forward, and their tails stream backward.  The front-most figure, one of Shakespeare's "cherubin" (angels), wears a gown that covers her lower body, sits on the horse with her right leg drawn up, but turns her upper body to face the viewer.  With both of her arms, she reaches down to hold the child, who stands with his right foot on the fingertips of her left hand.  With her right hand she supports the child.  Her flame-like hair stands on end, angled to the left.  She looks down toward the woman lying below, or perhaps toward the child.  The child faces away from the viewer, but bends its head and body backwards to look up towards the female who holds him.  The child’s right leg is extended down and back; its left leg is not pictured.  Its arms are raised horizontally (or between the horizontal and 135 degrees) with palms out and up.  Behind the front-most female figure, and facing away from the viewer, is another figure of uncertain gender (more likely male than female?) with semi-long hair.  This figure’s upper body is nude, but the drapery streaming out behind him suggests that a gown covers his lower body.  His arms are extended horizontally with palms down.  Beneath the horses and the figures above lies a supine, gowned female with long, curly hair.  Her arms are bent at the elbows and her hands clasped on her breast with fingers interlinked in an attitude of prayer.  Her head is bent back in a limp posture.  Her eyes are open, pupils raised, and her lips might be slightly parted.  The horses fly over clouds.  Slanting lines of rain fall from the clouds at right.  The woman lies on the ground, which may be covered with low-growing vegetation (grass, moss, or lichens).  The background is dark; this is certainly a stormy scene, and may be a night scene.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>angel</characteristic><characteristic>partly nude</characteristic><characteristic>drapery</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>hair standing on end</characteristic><characteristic>flame-like hair</characteristic><characteristic>leg drawn up</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>twisted</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>right foot</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>reaching</characteristic><characteristic>riding</characteristic><characteristic>straddling</characteristic><characteristic>bending forward</characteristic><characteristic>arms down</characteristic><characteristic>hunched over</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The front-most female figure in the upper part of the design, whose lower body is draped with a gown, sits on the front-most horse.

Her right leg is drawn up, her lower body faces to the right, and she turns her upper body to face the viewer.  With both of her arms, she reaches down to hold the child, who stands on one foot on the fingertips of her left hand; she supports the child with her right hand.  Her long, flame-like hair stands on end, angled to the left.  She looks down and to the left, toward the woman lying below, or perhaps toward the child.  Her bare right foot is prominent.  She sits on a blanket draped over the horse’s back.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>child</characteristic><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>infant</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>young</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>hovering</characteristic><characteristic>head bent back</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>facing away</characteristic><characteristic>seen from behind</characteristic><characteristic>facing up</characteristic><characteristic>leg extended backward</characteristic><characteristic>bending backward</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>short hair</characteristic><characteristic>mouth open</characteristic><characteristic>arms raised horziontally</characteristic><characteristic>arms raised at 135 degrees</characteristic><characteristic>crucified</characteristic><characteristic>hands raised, palms out</characteristic><characteristic>hands raised, palms up</characteristic><characteristic>palms up</characteristic><characteristic>tiptoe</characteristic><characteristic>pity</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A nude male child or infant with short, curly hair stands (or hovers) with his right foot on tiptoe on the fingers of the central female figure.

The child’s right leg is extended down and back; his left leg is not pictured.  His arms are raised horizontally (or between the horizontal and 135 degrees) in a cruciform posture with palms raised up and out.

Their mouths are open, and the mouth of the front-most horse contains a bit attached to a rein that loops over its neck.  The manes of the horses (or at least the mane of the front-most horse) fly forward, and the tails stream backwards.  The front-most horse has a blanket draped over its back, visible to the left of its rider.  A small tassel decorates its corner.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="CD"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>mother</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>dead</characteristic><characteristic>legs together</characteristic><characteristic>arms bent</characteristic><characteristic>hands together</characteristic><characteristic>praying</characteristic><characteristic>hands on breasts</characteristic><characteristic>shroud</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>partly nude</characteristic><characteristic>lying</characteristic><characteristic>facing up</characteristic><characteristic>head bent back</characteristic><characteristic>supine</characteristic><characteristic>eyes raised</characteristic><characteristic>mouth open</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Beneath the horses and the figures above lies a supine female with long, curly hair whose head is bent back limply.
