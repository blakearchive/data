                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>Part of a sequence of seven interrelated drawings, this design depicts a field of grain and, near it, a Christ-like figure surrounded by other figures who seek his aid. This particular drawing has been tentatively identified as an illustration of Ruth 2: 1-17 because of the addition of a gleaning woman in the foreground. The Ruth figure stands before a large area of waist-high grain (perhaps wheat). She faces left, bending over at the waist and striding forward with her right leg. Her left leg bends and extends backward; her left arm bends slightly and extends downward as she points toward the ground in front of her. Ruth's head also tilts downward as she gazes at the ground. Her long hair is gathered into a bun. She is nude from the waist up, her left breast appearing prominently below her extended arm, and she wears a long skirt. In front of Ruth, at the left edge of the grain field, stands the "good farmer," who, if the design illustrates part of the book of Ruth, may represent Boaz. The farmer has also been identified with Christ. The farmer has short hair; he wears a long-sleeved shirt and a skirt that reaches his ankles. The farmer's body faces forward and to the right; his right leg extends forward as if walking toward Ruth, and he extends both arms toward her with his palms up. The farmer turns his head to the left to look back at the group of figures behind him. These three figures face forward and to the right. They are, from left to right: a shorter figure, perhaps a woman or child, who wears a knee-length skirt and walks toward the farmer with left leg forward and arms extended out in front; a gowned, long-haired man who kneels with arms held at his sides, palms up, and fingers spread; and an older, bearded man who kneels and raises his left arm into the air, almost touching the farmer's shoulder with his hand. To the right of the farmer, behind the edge of the grain field, stands another male figure who faces forward and crosses his right arm over his chest. He faces the viewer, and his right hand may rest on his left shoulder. In the upper left corner of the design, a set of small buildings appears in the background. Against the left border is a simple structure with a slanted roof and no visible doors or windows. In front of the house, a four-legged animal (possibly a horse?) appears to be eating from a raised trough or bucket. Below and to the right of this animal may be a pile of feed, another animal, or some other object; even further to the right, a human figure or animal appears to crawl along the ground. It may be dead or dying. Behind the house and these figures is a longer building. The haphazard lines at the right of this building may suggest that it is on fire or in some way damaged. Further in the background, immediately behind the long building, is a smaller house with a chimney. Smoke rises from the chimney and floats to the right. In the upper righthand corner, another field of grain appears in the distance. Curved lines at the edges of the field suggest that it may be partially surrounded by other vegetation. Alternatively, these lines may suggest fire, as harsher diagonal lines appear atop the grain, and darkened clouds (perhaps smoke) appear above it. To the right of the field stand six(?) figures. They are, from left to right: a figure who faces left and raises his(?) arms horizontally toward the field, holding some sort of tool; another figure standing beside him, also facing the field; a figure that faces the viewer but turns her(?) head to the right and holds something in her arms (perhaps an infant); the babe in arms; a curved line suggesting the head of another figure; and a figure who faces forward and to the right, as if looking toward something beyond the design's right border. Mountains fill the center of the design's background, just above the farmer's head. Dark clouds rise above the mountains, perhaps mingling with smoke from the chimney at left and the fire at right.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>At left of the "good farmer," three figures face forward and to the right. They appear to be asking him for aid. Leftmost stands a shorter figure, perhaps a woman or child, who wears a knee-length skirt but appears to be nude from the waist up. Her hair may be pulled into a bun. The figure strides rightward with her left foot forward; her right leg extends backward, and she stands on the toes of her right foot as she leans in the farmer's direction. Her arms extend in front of her, nearly horizontally, and her hands are cupped together, palms up, as if asking for food or alms. She gazes toward the right side of the design, looking toward the field grain.</illusobjdesc>
