   The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of <hi rend="i">The [First] Book of Urizen</hi> Copy D (British Museum).<lb/><lb/>
   Blake etched in shallow relief the 28 plates of <hi rend="i">The [First] Book of Urizen</hi> in 1794, although only Copies A and B contain them all. Copy D, with 26 plates, was beautifully and extensively color printed in 1794, along with Copies A, C, E, F, and J. Copy D is the sixth of eight extant Copies to enter the Archive, joining Copies A, B (1795), C, F, and G (1818). Like these and all the illuminated books in the Archive, its text and images are fully searchable and are supported by our Inote and ImageSizer applications. With the Archive's Compare feature, users can easily juxtapose multiple impressions of any plate across the different copies of this or any of the other illuminated book. New protocols for transcription, which produce improved accuracy and fuller documentation in editors' notes, have been applied to Copy D and to all the <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> texts previously published.<lb/><lb/>
   With the publication of <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> Copy D, the Archive now contains fully searchable and scalable electronic editions of 55 copies of Blake's 19 illuminated books in the context of full bibliographic information about each work, careful diplomatic transcriptions of all texts, detailed descriptions of all images, and extensive bibliographies. In addition to illuminated books, the Archive contains many important series of engravings, sketches, and watercolor drawings, including <hi rend="i">Illustrations to Thomas Gray's Poems</hi>, <hi rend="i">Water Color and Engraved Illustrations to Dante's Divine Comedy</hi>, The Large Color Printed Drawings of 1795 and c. 1805, and the recently published Linnell set of <hi rend="i">Book of Job</hi> water colors and the <hi rend="i">Sketchbook Containing Drawings for the Engraved Illustrations to the Book of Job</hi>.<lb/><lb/>
   As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible through the continuing support of the Library of Congress, the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia, by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and by the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.

A fully gowned old man with closed eyes and long, flowing white hair and beard, presumably 
Urizen, sits cross-legged on a large book in the center foreground.  Centered behind him is a pair of stone tablets with arched tops, like 
tombstones.  Indeterminate dark forms, perhaps another arching tree, appear above and on both sides of the tablets.  Lying on the ground to the man's left and right are two sets of quadrangular stone tablets or books or, 
alternatively, the ends of a single long tablet, perhaps a coffin lid.  The dark background, trees, and tablets 
taken together suggest a graveyard setting.  Beneath Urizen's feet is an open book.  The toes of his 
right foot emerge from his beard to mark his place in the book.  Tree roots sprout to left and right 
in the foreground beneath the book and tablets.  Holding a writing instrument in each hand and 
resting his arms on the tablets to his left and right, Urizen seems to be copying from the book onto 
the tablets.  The instruments may be quills, graphite pencils, or etching needles.  Publication information is centered beneath the book.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="CD"><characteristic>Urizen</characteristic><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>old</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>sitting cross-legged</characteristic><characteristic>contracted</characteristic><characteristic>legs crossed</characteristic><characteristic>eyes closed</characteristic><characteristic>eyes down</characteristic><characteristic>arms raised horizontally</characteristic><characteristic>arms resting</characteristic><characteristic>right foot</characteristic><characteristic>knees</characteristic><characteristic>writing</characteristic><characteristic>copying</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A fully gowned old man with long, flowing white hair and beard, presumably Urizen,
