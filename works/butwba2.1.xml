            <updatestmt> The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of a
                digital edition of forty-seven monochrome wash drawings created by Blake between c.
                1774 and c. 1786. <lb/>
                <lb/> The use of monochrome washes to tint a pencil or pen and ink drawing offered
                eighteenth-century artists several advantages. They could register gradations in
                tone, from the white of the untouched paper to jet black, without the more
                time-consuming use of actual colors. No further work was required if the wash
                drawing was intended as a preliminary for an uncolored engraving. A monochrome wash
                could also be used to underlie subsequent applications of water colors, thereby
                darkening selected areas to create the illusion of depth or cast motifs in shadow. <lb/>
                <lb/> As the works presented here show, Blake made full use of monochrome washes
                from his earliest years as an artist. When assigned by his engraving master, James
                Basire, to record tombs in Westminster Abbey c. 1774-75, Blake applied black and
                gray washes to tint many of his drawings (Objects 1-5). These carefully executed
                works could then be used as preliminaries for subsequent engravings by Basire’s
                workshop. <lb/>
                <lb/> Blake’s monochrome washes during his first decade as an independent artist and
                engraver include several interrelated groups. The seven drawings of figures from
                Michelangelo’s Sistine ceiling (Objects 37-43) demonstrate how copying engravings of
                works by Renaissance masters helped Blake learn postures and gestures he would later
                use in his own compositions. Other drawings provide visual evidence of how Blake
                developed a design from early sketches to highly finished water colors or
                engravings. The recto/verso drawings, <hi rend="i">Two Sketches for “Joseph Making
                    Himself Known to His Brethren”</hi> (Objects 34 and 35), are preliminaries for
                the finished water color in the Fitzwilliam Museum, one of three illustrations of
                the biblical story of Joseph that are among Blake’s finest pictorial works of the
                1780s. The three Joseph water colors are in the Archive along with a water color
                preliminary for <hi rend="i">Joseph Ordering Simeon to be Bound</hi>. The evolution
                of one of Blake’s earliest original book illustrations, a frontispiece for Thomas
                Commins’ <hi rend="i">Elegy Set to Music</hi> of 1786, can be traced through three
                variant wash drawings (Objects 45-47) and a pencil sketch also in the Archive. The
                four wash versions of <hi rend="i">The Good Farmer</hi> reproduced here (Objects
                16-19), in addition to two pen and ink drawings of the subject previously added to
                the Archive, show the complex ways Blake played variations on a theme as he worked
                toward a final version. No such finished work is known, and thus these drawings are
                our only record of Blake’s engagement with this subject. Similarly, for <hi rend="i"
                    >War Unchained by an Angel, Fire, Pestilence, and Famine Following</hi>, an
                untraced work Blake exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1784, we have only a
                preliminary study (Object 6). <lb/>
                <lb/> Blake’s illustrations to his poem <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> of c. 1789 are
                among his most accomplished monochrome wash drawings. These have been published in
                the Archive as an independent group coordinated with the <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi>
                manuscript. <lb/>

                    <p>This is an alternative preliminary design for the etching/engraving, designed
                        and engraved by Blake, for Thomas Commins, *An Elegy Set to Music* (1786).
                        The recto of this monochrome wash drawing includes another alternative
                        preliminary wash drawing for Commins (see Object 46). The discovery (or
                        rediscovery) of this wash drawing was announced in Martin Butlin, "Two Newly
                        Identified Sketches for Thomas Commins's *An Elegy* and Further Rediscovered

                        1992): 21-26. The pen and ink inscriptions on this drawing were probably

                    <illusobjdesc>This wash drawing depicts a male figure rowing a boat. His body
                        faces left, but he leans back and twists so that his torso faces the viewer
                        and his head looks to the right. His left arm bends at the elbow and his
                        left leg is bent at the knee, both at ninety-degree angles. His right arm
                        and leg extend outward, with both bent slightly at forty-five degree angles.
                        He holds an oar in each hand, although only the top halves are visible. The
                        bottom halves appear to be submerged in the water. He has short curly hair
                        and wears a tunic that appears to be open at the chest. He rows the boat in
                        a river, lake, or other body or water. A shore or bank appears near the boat
                        to the right, or it may be a large rock. A large leafy tree, or perhaps
                        several smaller leafy trees, appears in the background. The wash area below
                        the tree trunks may be a hill or patch of grass. There are several
                        indeterminate, light sketch marks in the lower right corner.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>This wash drawing depicts a male figure rowing a boat. His
                            body faces left, but he leans back and twists so that his torso faces
                            the viewer and his head looks to the right. His left arm bends at the
                            elbow and his left leg is bent at the knee, both at ninety-degree
                            angles. His right arm and leg extend outward, with both bent slightly at
                            forty-five degree angles. He holds an oar in each hand, although only
                            the top halves are visible. The bottom halves appear to be submerged in
                            the water. He has short curly hair and wears a tunic that appears to be
                            open at the chest. </illusobjdesc>
