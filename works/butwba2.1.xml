The discovery (or rediscovery) of this wash drawing was announced in Martin Butlin, "Two Newly Identified Sketches for Thomas Commins's *An Elegy* and Further Rediscovered Drawings of the 1780s," *Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly*, 26.1 (summer 1992): 21-26.  The pen and ink inscriptions on this drawing were probably written by Henry Cunliffe no earlier than 1862.</p><p>The inscriptions at the bottom of the leaf read "Purchased at Sothebys in a Lot / 28.

                    <illusobjdesc>This wash drawing depicts a male figure rowing a boat. His body faces left, but he leans back and twists so that his torso faces the viewer and his head looks to the right. His left arm bends at the elbow and his left leg is bent at the knee, both at ninety-degree angles. His right arm and leg extend outward, with both bent slightly at forty-five degree angles. He holds an oar in each hand, although only the top halves are visible. The bottom halves appear to be submerged in the water. He has short curly hair and wears a tunic that appears to be open at the chest. He rows the boat in a river, lake, or other body or water. A shore or bank appears near the boat to the right, or it may be a large rock. A large leafy tree, or perhaps several smaller leafy trees, appears in the background. The wash area below the tree trunks may be a hill or patch of grass. There are several indeterminate, light sketch marks in the lower right corner.</illusobjdesc>
