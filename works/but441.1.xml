            The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of 20 of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible. These designs illustrate the Old Testament and are arranged according to the passages illustrated.  They are presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).
            <lb/><lb/>
            The Bible had an enormous influence on Blake’s work as both artist and poet.  Among his many and complex responses to that text are water color drawings.  The present group of 20 is selected from a sequence of about 80 biblical water colors of similar size Blake painted for Thomas Butts between c. 1800 and c. 1806.  These designs emphasize interactions between the human and the divine.  In works such as <hi rend="i">Ezekiel’s Wheels</hi> and <hi rend="i">David Delivered Out of Many Waters</hi>, the interaction is revelatory or redemptive.  In other designs, including <hi rend="i">Pestilence: The Death of the First-Born</hi>, the relationship between God and humankind devolves into punishment and destruction.
            <lb/><lb/>
            This group of 20 water colors is the first installment in our publication of a large selection of Blake’s water color drawings illustrating the Bible.  In coming months we will publish a group of New Testament illustrations also from the series executed for Butts.  Later we will add early works, such as <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>, datable to c. 1780, and continue through Blake’s final biblical water colors, including <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi> of c. 1824.

Moses stands in the center of the design in contrapposto. He faces forward, but turns his head left, in profile. His left leg is bent and on tiptoe. Both feet are visible. He has long, curly hair and a beard. Moses wears a long, toga-like gown and sandals and has his arms at his side. In his left hand he holds a shepherd's crook. In his right hand he holds what may be a rolled up scroll or piece of parchment. On the left of the design is a small, leafy bush on fire. Smoke billows up into the sky from the bush. On the left of Moses is a ram with curled horns. Behind Moses and extending to the right of the design are at least four sheep. All of the sheep are grazing, with their heads down and their mouths open. They face forward and to the left. Those sheep whose heads are visible also have their eyes open. On the right of the design is the trunk of a large tree. Its leafy branches extend over Moses's head. The ground is grassy with some indeterminate, leafy vegetation to left of the ram. The sky is cloudy, with a wash that may suggest sunrise or sunset. An orb is visible in the top left corner of the design, probably the moon.
