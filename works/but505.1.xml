      <seriesstmt>The William Blake Archive</seriesstmt>
      <updatestmt>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of thirty-three of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible.  All take their subjects from the New Testament and have been added to the twenty Old Testament subjects published in March 2010 as “Illustrations to the Bible, c. 1780-1824,” under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.  This new group is presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).
                
        <lb/>
        <lb/>
        Blake executed most of these New Testament water colors c. 1800-05 for his patron Thomas Butts.  The exceptions are 
        <hi rend="i">The Whore of Babylon</hi>
        of 1809 and 
        <hi rend="i">The Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins</hi>
        in the Yale Center for British Art, datable to c. 1825. The subjects range from the childhood of Jesus to his ascension, the later history of his parents and one of his major followers, St. Paul, and a group of eight designs based on the Book of Revelation.  While the illustrations of the life of Christ are fairly conventional in their subjects, in part because of the long tradition of picturing almost every event in the Gospels, individual motifs recall designs in Blake’s illuminated books and thus offer a window on Blake’s visual interpretation of the Bible. The illustrations of Revelation complement Blake’s intense engagement with apocalyptic events and images in his own poetry.
                    
        <lb/>
        <lb/>
        The selection of fifty-three biblical water colors now available in the Archive will be supplemented in the future with early works, such as 
        <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>
        , datable to c. 1780, and will continue through Blake’s final biblical water colors, such as 
        <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi>
        .

        <illustration location="E" type="plate">
          <illusobjdesc>The design is based on Acts 1:9-11. Toward the top center hovers Jesus, ascending into heaven. He wears a gown and faces away, with his left leg bent and extended backward. He has long, curly hair and his arms are raised at 135 degrees. To the left of Jesus hovers a winged and gowned male angel with short, curly hair. He is upside down and faces forward and right, looking down at the crowd below. He is probably descending. His mouth may be slightly open. His arms are at his side, pointing upward. To the right of Jesus hovers a winged and gowned male angel with long, curly hair. He is upside down and faces forwad and left, looking down at the crowd on the ground. He may be descending. His arms are at his side, pointing upward. The sky backing the scene is mostly clear, with a few clouds. At the top center of the design is a radiance that likely indicates the divine presence or entrance to heaven. Five gowned male figures with curly hair stand on the ground to the left of Jesus; they are his apostles. The leftmost figure has a long beard and faces forward and to the right, looking up. His arms are bent upward with his hands together as though in prayer or supplication. The second-to-left figure faces right and forward, looking up. The middle figure of this group appears to be old, and faces away, looking up and to the right. His arms are bent upward with his fingers spread and his palms vertical. His left leg is bent and extended back slightly on tiptoe. He wears sandals on his feet. The second-to-right figure has a beard and wears a sandal on his right foot, which is on tiptoe. His right leg is bent and extended backward slightly. His right arm is bent upward with his right palm vertical. The rightmost figure of this group faces away and to the right and looks up. He has a beard and bends his right leg back slightly. He bends his arms upward with his palms together as though in prayer or supplication. Six gowned male figures with curly hair stand on the ground to the right of Jesus; they are also his apostles. The leftmost figure has long hair and faces away and to the left, looking up. His left leg is bent and extended backward slightly, on tiptoe. He wears a sandal on his left foot. His mouth is open. He bends his arms upward with his palms together as though in prayer or supplication. This may be John, the youngest of Christ's disciples. The second-to-left figure has a long beard and may have his mouth open slightly. He faces away and to the left and looks up. His arms are bent upward with his hands clenched together as though in prayer or supplication. His left leg is bent back slightly and his left foot is on tiptoe. The third-to-left figure appears to be that of an old man with a long beard. He faces forward and to the left and looks up. His mouth may be partly open. The third-to-right figure has short hair and faces to the left, looking up. His left arm is at his side but may be bent. The second-to-right figure has short hair and faces forward and to the left, looking up. His mouth may be partly open. The rightmost figure is that of an old man with a long beard. He faces left and slightly forward, looking up. His left arm may be at his side. The figures on the ground stand on what appears to be a strip of bare earth.
