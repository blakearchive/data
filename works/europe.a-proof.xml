               <illusobjdesc>An old, nude, but muscular man with long hair and beard squats within a
                  circle, perhaps meant to represent the disc of the sun. His hair and beard extend
                  horizontally to the left, as though blown by a strong wind from right to left. His
                  left leg is bent at the knee, with both left knee and left foot prominent. His
                  right leg is kneeling, with the lower leg bent back, on the edge of the circle. He
                  is hunched over and looks down or has his eyes closed; his left arm is extended
                  down. He holds a pair of dividers or compasses in his left hand, with his
                  forefinger spread away from his other fingers. Although partly erased, lines above
                  his back may picture his right upper arm drawn back behind his body. Slight
                  indications of a robe or some sort of drapery appear just right of the figure's
                  left foot. Beams of light emanate from the circle, surrounded by clouds except
                  where the man's arm extends downward. The figure is very probably Urizen in the
                  act of creating and/or circumscribing the material universe. This design, perhaps
                  Blake's most famous, has also been titled by critics "The Ancient of Days" and
                  "God Creating the Universe."</illusobjdesc>

               <illusobjdesc>The pictorial image is treated as a full-plate design. A giant snake is
                  coiled just above the imprint. Its upper body reaches upward in two loops,
                  suggesting a spiral, with its head facing to the right. A small crest rises from
                  the top of its head. Its mouth is open; both its long forked tongue and teeth are
                  prominent. Its body extends beyond the lower right margin of the plate and then
                  returns under the imprint, with its tail ending below "Blake" in the imprint. The
                  mottled pattern on the snake's body suggests scales. Below the two large coils of
                  its lower body and right of "Lambeth" (line 4) in the imprint are some vegetative
                  forms, perhaps leaves. The washes behind the snake's coils suggest clouds, hills,
                  or mountains. The snake has been identified as the serpent-form of Orc, the
                  personification of revolutionary energy.</illusobjdesc>

                     its tail ending below "Blake" (line 5) in the imprint. The mottled pattern on
                     the snake's body suggests scales. The snake has been identified as the
                     serpent-form of Orc, the personification of revolutionary
                     energy.</illusobjdesc>

               <illusobjdesc>Two figures appear in the landscape above the text. A nude male sits
                  crouching in a contracted posture within a cave surrounded at its mouth with large
                  stones. His legs are drawn up and his legs crossed at the ankles. He faces to the
                  left, toward the other figure. His left arm is bent at the elbow, with his forearm
                  and index finger on his left hand pointing up. He grasps a knife or dagger in his
                  right hand. He may be an assassin, contemplating the murder of the figure to the
                  left. This figure on the left is a youthful male wearing tights, a hat, a bundle
                  or backpack on his back, and belts over his chest. He strides forward and to the
                  left. He faces left and holds a walking-stick in his right hand. His left arm is
                  bent at the elbow, with his left forearm and hand behind his back. He is probably
                  one of Blake's representations of a traveler. Below his feet is a path or road.
                  Right and left of this walking figure, and above the cave with the assassin, are
                  the leaves of plants or trees. There are also the leaves of plants below the
                  traveler and possibly below and to the right of the cave.</illusobjdesc>

               <illusobjdesc>There is a good deal of interlinear decoration, particularly in the
                  margins of the text. Most consists of vines and leaves, but there are also a few
                  animals. The first letter of the first word in line 2 twists into a spiral vine on
                  the left; it (or another, detached vine) descends with one further loop in the
                  left margin to line 10. A long, wavy vine extends between lines 4 and 5. On it is
                  a long-legged spider, just above "other sons" in line 5. Further to the left,
                  under the first word of line 4, is a small form that may be a fly, moth, or
                  butterfly. A vine trails downward from this same first word ("And") in line 4.
                  Just left of the beginning of line 13 is a flying creature, perhaps an insect of
                  some sort. In the bottom left corner of the plate, a vine descends from the first
                  letter of the first word in the last line of text (line 16). In the right margin,
                  another branch of the vine extending between lines 4 and 5 descends from the
                  design above the text all the way to the lower margin. It bears loops, at least
                  two types of leaves, and perhaps some fruit or flowers. A butterfly sits on the
                  upper reaches of this vine (opposite line 4); a worm (note the reticulations) or
                  caterpillar inches its way across the upper reaches of a large, slender leaf
                  opposite the space between lines 8 and 9. Other branches of this vine extend above
                  the falling figure and intertwine with the large leaf to the right of this same
                  figure. To the right are two flying birds. A separate vine with spiky leaves
                  twists right of lines 5 and 6, growing from the "d" in "thunder." Below one of its
                  tendrils, and just to the right of line 8, is a flying insect, perhaps a beetle or
                  fly. A somewhat jagged vine extends horizontally following line 7; to the right is
                  another vine, growing from the top of the second letter of "of" in line
                  8.</illusobjdesc>

               <illusobjdesc>Although containing considerable text, the plate is treated as a
                  full-page design showing four nude males hovering in the sky or on clouds. The two
                  text panels are shaped like clouds. Upper right, we see a figure from behind with
                  his left leg bent and his left foot poised on a cloud extending down and to the
                  left. His right leg is extended; he may be rising. We do not see his arms, but his
                  hands clutch his head. This gesture suggests despair. His hair may be curly. Below
                  is a group of three wrestling figures, all nude and bald. The central figure has
                  his legs spread, with his left leg extended and his right bent at the knee with
                  his right foot below his prominent (if somewhat abstractly rendered) genitals. He
                  looks down and to the right. With his right arm he grasps another bald nude around
                  the neck, apparently in an attempt to strangle him. This central figure's left arm
                  is bent at the elbow and he grasps the neck of another bald nude with his left
                  hand. The figure on the left has his legs spread and bent at the knees. He looks
                  up and to the right and tries, with both hands, to release the central male's arm
                  from around his neck. The wrestler on the right has his legs spread, with his left
                  leg extended vertically and his right leg bent at the knee. His arms are bent back
                  over his shoulders and grasp the left leg of the central male. All three figures
                  have caricature-like facial expressions suggesting fear and pain (figures right
                  and left) or desperation and cruelty (central figure).</illusobjdesc>

               <illusobjdesc>Although the plate contains a good deal of text and a great deal of
                  interlinear decoration, the major pictorial motifs&#8212;the sky and the two largest
                  figures&#8212;constitute a full-plate design. The three text panels are shaped like,
                  and may represent, clouds floating in the sky. The largest figure, hovering
                  horizontally in the air just below the heading, is a gowned female. The hem of her
                  garment forms a snake-like tail. Her body is twisted, facing forward below the
                  waist and facing down above the waist. Her long, curled hair cascades over (and
                  hence obscures) her face. Her arms are bent at the elbows and her hands are
                  clasped behind her head. She has large wings, and thus may be an angel. More
                  specifically, in the context of this poem, she has been identified as Enitharmon,
                  a nature goddess of fallen time and space, and as the "nameless shadowy female"
                  (plate 4, line 2) who wraps a "turban of thick clouds" around her "lab'ring head"
                  (plate 4, line 13). Below her cascading hair is a nude, youthful male in a
                  contracted posture. He seems confined by the circle in which he sits. This circle
                  may be meant to represent a globe; it has been described as a comet, although
                  there is no tail. It may be a planet. His legs are bent at the knees and drawn up
                  to his chest; his arms are bent at the elbows with his hands, formed into fists,
                  against his cheeks just below his eyes. He faces forward. Flames surround him
                  within the globe. This may be Orc, the spirit of revolution here confined, the
                  "secret child" (of Enitharmon?) mentioned on the plate (line 4), or one of
                  Enitharmon's "vig'rous progeny of fires" (plate 5, line 8). The other motifs on
                  this plate, including many human figures, will be treated as interlinear
                  designs.</illusobjdesc>

               <illusobjdesc>The heading is surrounded by several figures and vegetative motifs. The
                  figures, particularly the larger ones, may be the "sons &amp; daughters" (line 8)
                  of Enitharmon referred to on the plate. The lower left corner of "A" (in "A /
                  PROPHECY" [lines 1-2]) grows into a long vine with branches. Standing on this
                  vine, near the left foot of the letter, is a human figure facing forward. His or
                  her arms, raised vertically, grow into limbs of a tree that bend downwards, as
                  with a willow. The motif suggests the classical myth of Daphne and her vegetating
                  metamorphosis. This parallel suggests that the figure is female. On the right foot
                  of "A" is a tree, possibly a palm, with branches that bend downward. To the left
                  of the "A" and slightly below it is a male(?) embracing a female. Both hover in
                  the air, with the male on the right and facing to the left. Both have long hair
                  and appear nude, although the woman has a long, snake-like tail of drapery
                  extending from her right leg. The man's body is twisted into a curve, seen from
                  behind. His left arm is raised horizontally and embraces the woman's waist. His
                  right leg is extended horizontally. We also see the woman from behind, with her
                  body twisted into a curve matching the man's. Both her arms are raised
                  horizontally, with her head facing down. These gestures suggest that she is trying
                  to escape from the man. In contrast, the couple right of the letter "A" is
                  embracing mutually and appear to be kissing. The winged male(?), possibly an
                  angel, hovers horizontally in the air, with his arms raised at 45 degrees to
                  embrace the woman(?) who hovers vertically. She too is winged and may be an angel.
                  Her legs are bent back and her arms raised at 135 degrees to embrace her
                  companion. He faces down and to the left; she faces up and to the right. Below the
                  "A" is a hunched over, and apparently gowned, figure facing to the left. This
                  extremely contracted figure, with his or her upper body and head bent down to
                  touch the upper legs, sits on a cloud outline. Other cloud outlines extend to the
                  upper right and below "PROPHECY" in the heading. Two figures hover in, or fly
                  through, the air above the "Y" of "PROPHECY" (line 3). Both are nude; the upper
                  figure appears to be male, while the lower figure seems to be female. Both have
                  their left arms raised horizontally and right arms raised at 135 degrees, and both
                  may be holding something in their right hands. The letters of "PROPHECY" are well
                  decorated with eight human figures and vines. Proceeding from left to right, these
                  include a vine with leaves or lily-like flowers intertwined with the first letter
                  and extending to the second. A small standing figure holds the vertical of the
                  first "P," and a small, indistinct figure dangles from the base of the letter.
                  Another figure stands on the foot of the vertical of the "R" and faces to the left
                  with arms raised vertically. Above this figure is a small form that may be a
                  descending child or infant, arms stretched downward toward the adult. The right
                  foot of the "R" bears a very small seated figure, hunched over and facing to the
                  right. The letter "O" has two vines with lily-like flowers. Standing within the
                  "O" is a figure facing forward and with left arm raised horizontally to hold a
                  shepherd's crook. To the right of this shepherd is a small flock of sheep. Three
                  vines, or perhaps flames, spring from the foot of the second "P." A vine, perhaps
                  with a few leaves, is intertwined with the next three letters ("HEC"). The final
                  vine in this group springs from the foot of the final letter and forms a spiral
                  above and to the right of the letter. This "Y" also bears three human figures.
                  One, seen from behind and with legs spread and arms raised vertically, seems to be
                  climbing, with the right foot on the foot of the "Y" and the left foot on the "C."
                  A small figure, probably male, stands on top of the left diagonal of the "Y" in
                  "PROPHECY" (line 3). He seems to be walking to the left. Finally, the first bend
                  in the vine growing from the right side of the final letter bears a seated figure
                  facing right, with back slightly hunched over and right arm extended to the right
                  knee. This figure holds a book or tablet and is probably reading. Two flames, or
                  perhaps a flame-like plant, spring from the foot of the "Y" on its right
                  side.</illusobjdesc>

                     downwards, as with a willow. The motif suggests the classical myth of Daphne

               <illusobjdesc>The design below the text is dominated by two large figures and five
                  smaller ones. A nude and youthful male lies prone on the ground—or perhaps on a
                  bed of straw. He faces down, with his arms bent and his head resting on them. Only
                  part of his left arm and right hand are visible. His hair is curly and a halo of
                  fire surrounds his head. This is probably the youthful Orc. Above him, a nude
                  female with long, flame-like hair kneels on a cloud and leans dramatically to the
                  left. Her left leg is extended and her right bent at the knee under her torso. Her
                  arms are extended horizontally and she holds, and apparently lifts with both
                  hands, a cloak, blanket, or heavy drapery to uncover the youth below, at whom she
                  is looking. She is probably Enitharmon. The five much smaller figures above may be
                  her sons and daughters. In the left corner of the design, just below the text, we
                  see a nude figure lying supine on a cloud with legs bent and spread, body twisted
                  to the left, head apparently down and resting on the left arm extended
                  horizontally. The gender of this figure is uncertain; his or her posture suggests
                  erotic exhaustion. Similar exhaustion is indicated by the nude figure to the
                  right. This figure is probably female and also lies supine on a cloud. Her body is
                  bent back, with her head, right arm, and right leg dangling downward. Above and to
                  the right is another nude female, sitting or lying supine on a cloud with her
                  upper body propped up with her bent right arm. She faces right and probably has
                  long hair. Her right leg is extended to the right and her left leg bent at the
                  knee. Further to the right is an embracing couple hovering in the air, with the
                  woman on the right. They may be kissing. The nude male, facing right, has his legs
                  spread and his right arm raised horizontally. The female, facing left, is
                  gowned—or at least has a tail of drapery curling over her raised left leg. Her
                  legs are spread apart. Her long hair may be gathered into a bun.</illusobjdesc>

                  insects fly above the grain tassel. Another vine appears further to the right,

               <illusobjdesc>The setting is an enclosed interior space with a floor and a stone back
                  wall. A fireplace with a grate and an arched top is at the center of the back wall
                  and of the composition. A coal fire burns on the grate. Above is a large cooking
                  pot with a handle suspended from the top of the fireplace by a rod with a hook in
                  its lower end. Clouds of smoke or steam billow above the pot. In the foreground
                  are three figures. On the left is a gowned woman, facing right and in an extremely
                  contracted posture. She sits or squats on the floor with her legs drawn up to her
                  chest and her right arm wrapped around her right knee. Her head is down between
                  her knees; her long hair cascades to the ground. The gowned woman on the right
                  sits in an elegant, neoclassical chair. Her prominent knees are drawn up toward
                  her chest, with legs crossed. Her arms are apparently also crossed, with her left
                  hand near her right breast and her right hand near her left breast. She wears a
                  necklace of beads and faces up with a worried or pained expression, perhaps
                  looking at the pot. Below the woman in the chair is a male child, nude, rigid, and
                  lying supine on a white cloth spread on the floor. His eyes are closed and he is
                  probably dead. His hair is curly. A dark shadow slants across the upper half of
                  the scene. The wall behind and to the right of the seated woman is also in shadow.
                  Some interpreters have described this design as a scene of famine, including the
                  contemplation of cannibalism by the woman above the child's corpse. Gray washes
                  indicate shadows on the wall above and to the right of the women. </illusobjdesc>

               <illusobjdesc>The background of the design is composed of a brick wall with a large
                  wooden door. The closed door is inscribed "LORD [H]AVE MERC[Y] ON US" with a cross
                  below the inscription. Left of the door is a standing, and perhaps walking, figure
                  wearing a heavy black coat. He faces left, looks down with a worried expression,
                  and wears a large and dark bicorn hat. His left arm is at his side and he holds a
                  large bell in his left hand. This bellman, as well as the inscription on the door
                  (typical of quarantined houses) can be associated with the theme of plague
                  dominating the design. Since his mouth is slightly open, he may be calling out,
                  "Bring out your dead!" Below the bellman on the left are a man and woman. The man,
                  wearing a gown or at least a shirt, appears against the left margin of the plate
                  in profile, facing right and down, and perhaps holds the woman with his right arm.
                  His face suggests pain or despair; his hair is curly. The gowned woman sits on the
                  ground, with her upper body propped up by the man. Her hair is long and her right
                  arm is at her side. Her face, with mouth open like her companion’s, expresses
                  despair and perhaps pain, and the limp posture of her body indicates that she may
                  be weak with plague. They may be suffering from the plague. To the right, a gowned
                  woman with long hair seems to be falling on her knees. Her arms are raised
                  vertically as if in supplication, with the fingers of both hands spread apart. She
                  faces up, with her head bent back; like her companions, her posture expresses the
                  pain and despair indicative of the plague. A shadow, added in wash, cuts
                  diagonally across the background wall and door, top left to lower
                  right.</illusobjdesc>

                     what was written on the doors of quarantined houses during the great plague of
                     London in 1665.</illusobjdesc>

                  and perhaps stormy environment. A gowned and elderly male with long hair and beard

                  He may be Albion's Angel, frightened at the prospect of coming revolution. A
                  gowned woman kneels on the ground before the old man, with right leg extended

            <illustration type="interlinear" location="E">
               <illusobjdesc>This text plate contains many interlinear vines, birds, insects, and
                  three snakes. Four or five butterflies appear right of lines 1-4. A vine descends
                  from the first letter of the first word in line 6. Two vines grow from the first
                  letter of the first word in line 9. Vines, at least three birds, a leaf, and
                  flames decorate the space between lines 5 and 6. A butterfly and two other winged
                  insects, two vines (one may be a worm), and an odd shape that may be two moths
                  flying close together appear between lines 8 and 9. A vine with multiple branches
                  and leaves wends its way through the margin right of lines 8-19. At least one
                  flower, shaped like a Meadia, grows close to the right margin of the plate, right
                  of line 9. Another such flower appears below and to the left of the first one,
                  right of line 12. On and around this large vine are an inch worm below the last
                  word in line 8, caterpillars (above and to the right of line 14 and right of lines
                  9-10 and 14-15), a spider (right of line 14), and several flying insects. Five
                  flying insects (at least one a butterfly) follow line 11. A vine descends left of
                  the first word in line 15. A vine with two loops grows from the descender of the
                  last letter of "thy" in line 20. A large bird, possibly an eagle, and three
                  smaller birds or insects fly near the right margin of the plate right of lines
                  18-20. A vine with many loops fills the considerable space between lines 20 and 21
                  and descends in the right margin to line 26. On this vine are at least two large
                  and two small caterpillars, an inch-worm, two snails, at least three spiders,
                  several insects with wings folded, and a bird perched near the right margin with
                  its mouth open (because it is singing?). Just to the left and within the loops of
                  the vine is another singing bird, facing left with mouth open. A large moth or
                  butterfly appears below "Antamon" in line 20. A flying insect is pictured far to
                  the right of line 23. Below and to the left is a large bird (possibly an eagle)
                  soaring upwards, with a flock of six birds to the left. The form right of lines
                  26-30 probably represents the sky. A vine descends from the second letter of "my"
                  in line 25. A vine or plant with leaves and several branches appears right of
                  lines 28-37. Intertwined with this vine is a snake, facing to the left with its
                  mouth open and its forked tongue clearly pictured. Two other snakes, both facing
                  left, appear in the bottom margin. The right-most snake in the lower margin has a
                  clearly pictured tongue. The last letter of the last word in line 34 grows into a
                  vine.</illusobjdesc>

                  spread apart, his genitals clearly visible. His left leg is extended to the right,
                  with his left foot on the ground. His right leg is bent at the knee with his foot
                  on one of at least two stone steps. He may be striding to the left. His body faces
                  forward, but his head is turned to the right. His expression is fearful or pained.
                  He may be looking at the flames forming the background of the design or at the
                  child whose left arm he grasps with his lowered left hand. Perhaps the man is the
                  child's father, attempting to rescue the child from the flames. Although the
                  child's hair is short, the gown visible around her legs suggests a female. We see
                  her from behind; her right arm is drawn back and raised at 135 degrees. Her left
                  leg is extended backward; she may be striding to the left. The nude male carries,
                  over his right shoulder, the limp body of a woman—perhaps the child's mother. The
                  man's right arm is raised, bent at the elbow, and embraces the woman around the
                  waist. Her left arm and long hair dangle down toward the man's right knee. Her
                  skirt or gown and one visible foot dangle behind the man's spread legs. She may be

                     woman—perhaps the child's mother. She may be nude from the waist up, although
                     the pen and ink outlining of the triangular shape above the back of her neck
                     suggests a collar. The man's right arm is raised, bent at the elbow, and
                     embraces the woman around the waist. Her left arm and long hair dangle down
                     toward the man's right knee. Her skirt or gown and one visible foot dangle
                     behind the man's spread legs. She may be dead or dying.</illusobjdesc>

               <illusobjdesc>The text area contains a good many vegetative motifs and animals. Three
                  vines extend horizontally between lines 2 and 3. The vine on the left includes a
                  loop and one ivy-like leaf. The next vine to the right bears two oak or grape
                  leaves. The largest vine, furthest to the right, has long, slender leaves. At
                  least four insects, perhaps beetles and one caterpillar, crawl on it. Three winged
                  insects (one little more than a dot) and one butterfly (below "fury" in line 2)
                  fly near the vine. Below "of his" in line 2, a bird perches on the vine but
                  spreads its wings as if about to fly into the air. An oak or grape leaf descends
                  from the first word in line 3 and into the far left margin. A vine with ivy-like
                  leaves extends horizontally between lines 8 and 9, divides into several branches
                  in the right margin, and has one branch arching back to the left at line 6. A
                  branch bearing five oak leaves and one acorn extends into the right margin
                  following the final line of text. To the right of this branch, a bird flies upward
                  on extended wings. A vine with two loops grows from the first letter of "FINIS"
                  and extends horizontally above the word.</illusobjdesc>
