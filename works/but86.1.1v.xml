                    <illusobjdesc>Four composition sketches are each separated by rough framing lines.  The sketch in the upper left quadrant contains at least one figure with raised arms leaning right, away from what may be flames at left.  The sketch in the upper right quadrant shows at least one figure seated facing right.  The sketch in the lower left quadrant contains two figures seated on a couch with an elaborate bolster-like arm.  Clouds or perhaps beams of light are visible above the pair at left.  The sketch in the lower right quadrant contains a single gowned figure facing right with one arm raised horizontally. There is a cluster of diagonal brushstrokes of grey wash to the left of this figure.  To the left of the line demarcating the lower left scene, a portion of a sketch continued from another leaf of sketches (Butlin 85 verso) is visible, indicating that the two pages were originally part of the same sheet of paper.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>Four composition sketches are each separated by rough framing lines.  The sketch in the upper left quadrant contains at least one figure who stands, runs, or perhaps leans to the right.  Its right leg is extended backward, its right arm raised horizontally, and its left arm raised at 135 degrees.  The figure may twist its head to look back to the left, where lines that suggest flames extend from the left margin of the sketch from which the figure is fleeing.  The multiplicity of lines forming the figure may suggest movement or, alternatively, the presence of a second figure directly behind the first.  This second figure, partly erased, may be an alternative posture for the first figure.</illusobjdesc>
