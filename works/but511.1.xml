    The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of thirty-three of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible.  All take their subjects from the New Testament and have been added to the twenty Old Testament subjects published in March 2010 as “Illustrations to the Bible, c. 1780-1824,” under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.  This new group is presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).
                <lb/><lb/>
                   Blake executed most of these New Testament water colors c. 1800-05 for his patron Thomas Butts.  The exceptions are <hi rend="i">The Whore of Babylon</hi> of 1809 and <hi rend="i">The Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins</hi> in the Yale Center for British Art, datable to c. 1825. The subjects range from the childhood of Jesus to his ascension, the later history of his parents and one of his major followers, St. Paul, and a group of eight designs based on the Book of Revelation.  While the illustrations of the life of Christ are fairly conventional in their subjects, in part because of the long tradition of picturing almost every event in the Gospels, individual motifs recall designs in Blake’s illuminated books and thus offer a window on Blake’s visual interpretation of the Bible. The illustrations of Revelation complement Blake’s intense engagement with apocalyptic events and images in his own poetry.
                    <lb/><lb/>
                        The selection of fifty-three biblical water colors now available in the Archive will be supplemented in the future with early works, such as <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>, datable to c. 1780, and will continue through Blake’s final biblical water colors, such as <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi>. 
                    <lb/><lb/>

His arms are raised with his hands clenched together as though in prayer or supplication. His eyes are unfocused and he may in fact already be dead. Joseph may have a halo around his head. Joseph is covered with a sheet and blanket and lies on a mattress or bed covered by a patterned carpet that continues onto the floor. There is a pillow under his head. Above and to the left of Joseph stands Jesus, partly kneeling and bending forward to look at Joseph. Jesus has long, curly hair and beard. He wears a gown and has a halo, but may be emanating a much larger aura. He faces forward and to the left, looking down. His right arm is bent upward and his left arm is raised at 45 degrees and bent to hold Joseph's head in his hand. To to the right of Joseph kneels the Virgin Mary with her legs bent under her. She may be old and has long, curly hair covered partly by a head veil. She wears a gown and faces left and down, bending forward slightly to look at Joseph. Her left arm is at her side but bent to touch Joseph's arm with her left hand. Mary has a halo around her head. Ten cherubs or angels hover in a rainbow above the Holy Family. All of the cherubs appear to be male with short, curly hair and wings on either side of their heads. All of the cherubs appear to be smiling and face forward but look down. The two rightmost cherubs have their mouths open. The wings of two more cherubs emerge from the left border of the design. This scene appears to take place in a darkened room.
