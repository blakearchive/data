Neither source, however, offers a precedent for Blake's double representation of Satan.  His still human and angelic form, armed with shield and spear, hovers over the sleeping Eve, but his bat-like wings indicate his fallen condition.  His serpentine form coils around Eve's lower body, arches over her head, and rests its crested head on her chest.  Her right hand lies limply over the forbidden fruit.</p></objnote><objsize>42.6 x 53.5 cm.</objsize><windowsize width="600" height="550"/></physdesc><illusdesc><illustration type="plate" location="E"><illusobjdesc>Satan, nude, muscular and bat-winged, hovers over the supine form of Eve.

With his right hand he clasps a shield that is fastened with a strap to his elbow.  In his left hand he holds an arrow-tipped spear.  A serpent twines around Eve’s bare feet, coils around her legs and lower body, arches over her limp, backward-bent head, and rests its spiky, crested head on her breast.  Eve has long, curly hair and lies with her legs together and her right arm at her side.  Her right hand rests limply, fingers slightly spread, on the forbidden fruit.  Eve lies on grass, moss, lichens, or some such vegetation.  Her eyes are closed; she may be sleeping or in a trance.  Flames mount upward from right to left from behind Eve's body and rise above Satan’s head.
