Lamech, a descendent of Cain and the central figure in the design, has in a rage killed the young man lower right.  Lamech clutches his head in despair and in the knowledge that the penalty of Cain will fall on him "seventy and sevenfold" (Genesis 4:24).  Lamech's two wives, Adah and Zillah, cling together on the left.  Blake may have known the more detailed telling of the story in the Apocrypha, as well as the traditional association between Lamech's son, Tubalcain, and metal working.</p></objnote><objsize>37.8 x 47.5 cm.</objsize><windowsize width="600" height="600"/></physdesc><illusdesc><illustration type="plate" location="E"><illusobjdesc>The central figure, Lamech, holds his head in distress as he stares at the dead body lying on the ground to the right.  His two wives, Adah and Zillah, stand to the left of Lamech, embracing each other as they look toward their husband.  A flowing piece of drapery, perhaps part of a tent, descends along the left margin of the design.  The background is mountainous and dark, with a dark cloud upper right.

He stares to the right at the dead body on the ground with a facial expression of despair and agony.  He has short (?) hair and a long beard.  His left foot is prominent at the hem of his flowing gown.  As he faces the viewer, he stands with his torso twisting slightly to the right.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="AC"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>Adah</characteristic><characteristic>Zillah</characteristic><characteristic>young</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>hem</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>twisted</characteristic><characteristic>despair</characteristic><characteristic>melancholy</characteristic><characteristic>embracing</characteristic><characteristic>hand</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>eyes raised</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Adah and Zillah, Lamech's two wives, embrace each other as they stand to the left of Lamech.  The woman on the left has long, flowing hair, curly where it falls over her right shoulder.  She is gowned, but her right shoulder and arm are bare.  Her right arm is under the other woman’s left arm and wrapped around the second woman’s waist.  Her left arm must be similarly wrapped around the other side of the woman’s torso, for her left hand rests along the other woman's side just below the right hand, which lies over, or is holding, the left wrist.  It seems that her left hand is clutching the gown.  She faces forward but twists to the right.  Her facial expression suggests sorrow or melancholy; her eyes appear to be looking into the distance rather than at Lamech or the dead man.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="AC"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>Adah</characteristic><characteristic>Zillah</characteristic><characteristic>young</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>drapery</characteristic><characteristic>hem</characteristic><characteristic>seen from behind</characteristic><characteristic>facing away</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>twisted</characteristic><characteristic>embracing</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>partly nude</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Adah and Zillah, Lamech's two wives, embrace each other as they stand to the left of Lamech.  The woman on the right has long, flowing hair.  She appears to be gowned from the hips to her feet.  Her left arm is over the other woman’s right arm, embracing her hip.  Although colored the same as the other woman's gown, we can see the outline of her right hand just under and below her left.  Thus, her right arm must also be wrapped around the woman on the left.  We see the woman on the right from behind, but her face is twisted sharply to right profile.  She appears to be looking at Lamech.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="CD"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>young</characteristic><characteristic>muscular</characteristic><characteristic>dead</characteristic><characteristic>crucified</characteristic><characteristic>arms extended</characteristic><characteristic>palm down</characteristic><characteristic>hand</characteristic><characteristic>short hair</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>lying</characteristic><characteristic>prone</characteristic><characteristic>limp</characteristic><characteristic>facing down</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Lower right is a muscular dead male lying prone on the ground.
