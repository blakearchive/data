                    There is no extant copy of Blake's etched Prospectus of 1793. According to Bentley, 
                    it was "probably composed, engraved, printed, and distributed rapidly in the autumn of 
                    1793" (*Blake Books*, page 450). Alexander Gilchrist acquired a copy of the Prospectus through 
                    "Mr. Frost" and transcribed it in *Life of William Blake, 'Pictor Ignotus'* (London: Macmillan, 1863). 
                    In Gilchrist's editorial note for the Prospectus (page 263, see Object View Page), Mr. Frost is identified by Bentley
                    as William Edward Frost of 8 Southampton Street, Fitzroy Square.

                    Blake's posthumous biographer Alexander Gilchrist died in 1861 before completing
                    his biography of Blake, which was finished by his wife, Anne Gilchrist, with
                    assistance from Dante Gabriel Rossetti and others (see also Bentley, *Blake Books*, pages 24-27).The title page of the 1863 volume containing
                    the Prospectus reads: "LIFE / OF / WILLIAM BLAKE, / 'PICTOR IGNOTUS' / WITH
                    SELECTIONS FROM HIS POEMS AND OTHER WRITINGS / BY THE LATE / ALEXANDER
                    GILCHRIST, / OF THE MIDDLE TEMPLE, BARRISTER-AT-LAW; / AUTHOR OF "THE LIFE OF
                    WILLIAM ETTY, R.A." // ILLUSTRATED FROM BLAKE'S OWN WORKS, / IN FACSIMILÉ BY
                    W.J. LINTON / AND IN PHOTOLITHOGRAPHY; / WITH A FEW OF BLAKE'S ORIGINAL PLATES.
                    // IN TWO VOLUMES. / VOL. II. // LONDON AND CAMBRIDGE / MACMILLIAN AND CO. 1863
                    // [The Right of Translation is reserved.]" Facing the title page is a
                    frontispiece with two engravings. The first is from Blake's Chaucer, Canterbury
                    Pilgrims; the caption reads: "Painted in Fresco by William Blake &amp; by Him
                    Engraved &amp; Published October 8 1810 at Nº28 Corner of Broad Street Golden
                    Square". The second is an 1861 engraving by Charles Simms.

                    The book was printed by R. Clay, Son, and Taylor, Bread Street Hill, London. Images presented here are from a copy in the Davis Library at the University
                    of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The Davis Library purchased this copy from the vendor Harding in 1940 for £1.8.
