            <updatestmt>
                The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of a digital edition of the manuscript of Blake's autograph (dated 16 January 1826) in the album of William Upcott.
                <lb/>
                <lb/>
                Upcott (1779-1845) was the illegitimate son of Blake’s friend and patron the miniaturist Ozias Humphry (1742-1810), who bequeathed to Upcott a number of Blake’s works. 
                Upcott was a bookseller, librarian, bibliographer, editor, and inveterate collector, but he was perhaps best known for what he called his “autographic mania” (qtd. in Freeman, “Upcott, William (1779–1845),” <hi rend ="i">ODNB</hi> [http://www.oxforddnb.com, accessed 18 Jan 2014]), which he exercised in his “autograph cottage” in Islington&#8212;where he was living when Blake left his autograph in Upcott’s album either during a visit just a few months before Blake died, or, more probably, off the premises as the album circulated among the authors and artists whose signatures Upcott sought to acquire.
                The album may have been at Samuel Leigh’s bookshop in the Strand, where Blake (and others) may have signed it: “On 16 Jan. 1826 he inscribed William Upcott’s autograph album ‘by the desire of Mr Leigh’” (Bentley, <hi rend ="i">Records</hi>, 369n).
                <lb/>
                <lb/>
                Upcott seems to have been a colorful character who earned the title Emperor of Autographs&#8212;he owned at least 40,000 according to his obituary. 
                He also owned illuminated works that his father bought directly from Blake: 
                <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> Copy H (containing only <hi rend="i">Experience</hi>), 
                <hi rend="i">America a Prophecy</hi> Copy H, 
                <hi rend="i">Europe a Prophecy</hi> Copy D, 
                <hi rend="i">A Small Book of Designs</hi> Copy A, 
                and <hi rend="i">A Large Book of Designs</hi>.  
                Upcott’s copy of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> and both books of <hi rend="i">Designs</hi> are in the Archive.
                <lb/>
                <lb/>
                Blake, perhaps “very much delighted with being in good Company” (Object 1, lines 1-2), inscribed a striking, elaborate signature with a characteristically Blakean note “Writ helter skelter like a hog upon a rope” (Object 1, lines 10-11) incorporating an equally characteristic sketch of a floating male, nude, with arms outstretched.  
                Blake’s signature appears just under that of the painter Benjamin Haydon.
                <lb/>

                    <p>The lines that surround Blake's drawing of a male figure were first sketched out in pencil before being inked over in order to plot out their position relative to the drawing. These faint pencil lines, still visible in some areas, were either imperfectly erased after the lines were rewritten in ink or have simply faded over time.</p>
                   <p>Blake also appears to have written, and then erased, text in the space slightly below the inked lines and beneath the figure's head. The text is not legible.</p>
                   <p>The images in this note have been color-enhanced to better reveal the pencil strokes and erased lines.

                    <p>Bentley speculates that the Mr. Leigh Blake refers to (line 7) may have been James Matthews Leigh, a painter and son of a bookseller. He further suggests that
                    as Blake provided the autograph by Leigh's desire, "the circumstances rather indicate Blake was not an acquaintence of Upcott's but could be trusted to respond to Leigh" 
                    ("Reliques of the Contemporaries of William Upcott, 'Emperor of Autographs,'" *Bulletin of the New York Public Library* 64 [1960]: 581-87).</p>

                    A number of letters appearing in words from lines 15 to 17 contain strokes that appear with a double line. See, for example, the "h" in "Autograph" (line 15) and the "d" in "Comfield" (line 16).  Blake's pen seems to have run low on ink and may have needed mending.</p>

                <p>Lines 18-21 are taken from Wordsworth's *Poems* (1815), which was loaned to Blake by Crabb Robinson in December of 1825 (Bentley, *Writings* volume 2, page 1322n).  They appear in one of a series of sonnets that were originally published by Wordsworth in 1807.  The first is entitled "From the Italian of Michael Angelo," while all subsequent sonnets in the series (including that cited by Blake) are entitled "From the Same."  In Wordsworth's *Poems* (1815), the lines, which Blake either copied or remembered imperfectly, are as follows: "Heaven-born, the Soul a heaven-ward course must hold; / Beyond the visible world She soars to seek, / (For what delights the sense is false and weak) / Ideal Form, the universal mould" (volume 2, page 179).  Blake also refers to this particular sonnet in his annotations to Wordsworth's *Poems* (1815) (*Writings* volume 1, page 44).</p>

                        A nude male figure with short curly hair floats or hovers horizontally with outstretched limbs. He twists his body at the torso to face forward, and turns his head slightly to the right. His left leg extends to the left, and his right leg bends backward at the knee. Both arms are raised at 135 degrees. The palm of the right hand is turned downward and holds the scroll-shaped ending of a line; the palm of the left hand is turned upward and supports the same line as it extends down the right side of the image. The single line forms a text panel that extends over the figure, forms serpentine twists to the right of the figure, and terminates above the figure's left knee.
