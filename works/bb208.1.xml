These signatures are not replicated here.  Blake's signature appears immediately below that of B. R. Haydon.</p><p>Lines 1-4, which surround Blake's drawing of a male figure, were first sketched out in pencil before being inked over in order to plot out their position relative to the drawing.  These faint pencil lines, still visible in some areas (and traced in red in the sample below), were either imperfectly erased after the lines were rewritten in ink or have simply faded over time.</p><illus filename="bb208.1a.note.jpg"/><illus filename="bb208.1b.note.jpg"/><p>A number of letters appearing in words from lines 15 to 17 contain additional strokes.  See, for example, the "h" in "Autograph" (line 15) and the "d" in "Comfield" (line 16).  Blake's pen may have needed mending.</p><p>Lines 18-21 are taken from Wordsworth's <hi rend="i">Poems</hi> (1815), which was loaned to Blake by Crabb Robinson in December of 1825 (Bentley, <hi rend="i">Writings</hi> volume 2, page 1322n).  They appear in one of a series of sonnets that were originally published by Wordsworth in 1807.  The first is entitled "From the Italian of Michael Angelo," while all subsequent sonnets in the series (including that cited by Blake) are entitled "From the Same."  In Wordsworth's <hi rend="i">Poems</hi> (1815), the lines, which Blake either copied or remembered imperfectly, are as follows: "Heaven-born, the Soul a heaven-ward course must hold; / Beyond the visible world She soars to seek, / (For what delights the sense is false and weak) / Ideal Form, the universal mould" (volume 2, page 179).  Blake also refers to this particular sonnet in his annotations to Wordsworth's <hi rend="i">Poems</hi> (1815) (volume 1, page 44).</p></objnote></physdesc><phystext><lg type="prose" justify="left"><l n="bb208.1.ms.01.01" justify="left" indent="4">William Blake<space extent="3"/>one who is very much delighted with</l><l n="bb208.1.ms.01.02" justify="left" indent="2">being in good Company</l></lg><vspace extent="3"/><lg type="prose" justify="left"><l n="bb208.1.ms.01.03" justify="left" indent="59">Born 28 <choice><orig>Nov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></orig><reg>November</reg></choice> 1757 in London</l><l n="bb208.1.ms.01.04" justify="left" indent="59">&amp; has died Several times Since<note>Erdman reads "Since" as "since" (page 698).</note></l><l n="bb208.1.ms.01.05" justify="left">January 16</l><l n="bb208.1.ms.01.06" justify="left" indent="3">1826</l></lg><vspace extent="1"/><lg type="prose" justify="left"><l n="bb208.1.ms.01.07" justify="left" indent="8">The above was written &amp; the drawing annexed by the desire of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Leigh how far it is an</l><l n="bb208.1.ms.01.08" justify="left">Autograph is a Question I do not think an Artist can write an Autograph especially one</l><l n="bb208.1.ms.01.09" justify="left">who has Studied in the Florentine &amp; Roman Schools as such <subst><del type="overwrite">a one</del><add type="overwrite" place="inline">an one</add></subst> will Consider what</l><l n="bb208.1.ms.01.10" justify="left">he is doing but an Autograph as I understand it, is Writ helter skelter like<gap reason="cancellation" extent="1" unit="character"/> a hog upon<note>Bentley reads "Writ" as "writ" (<hi rend="i">Writings</hi> volume 2, page 1321).</note></l><l n="bb208.1.ms.01.11" justify="left">a r<subst><del type="overwrite">i</del><add type="overwrite" place="inline">o</add></subst>pe or a Man who walks without Considering whether he shall r<subst><gap reason="overwrite" extent="2" unit="character"/><add type="overwrite" place="inline">un</add></subst> against a Post or a</l><l n="bb208.1.ms.01.12" justify="left">House or a Horse or a Man &amp; I am apt to believe that what is done without meaning is very</l><l n="bb208.1.ms.01.13" justify="left">different from that which a Man does with his Thought &amp; Mind &amp; <choice><orig>ought</orig><reg>aught</reg></choice> not to be <choice><orig>Calld</orig><reg>called</reg></choice> by<note>Erdman reads "does" as "Does" (page 698).</note></l><l n="bb208.1.ms.01.14" justify="left">the Same Name.</l><l n="bb208.1.ms.01.15" justify="left" indent="7">I consider the Autograph of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cruikshank which very justly Stands first in the Book<note>Bentley reads "Stands" as "stands" (<hi rend="i">Writings</hi> volume 2, page 1321).</note></l><l n="bb208.1.ms.01.16" justify="left">&amp; that Beautiful Specimen of Writing by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Comfield &amp; my own; as Standing the sam<subst><gap reason="overwrite" extent="1" unit="character"/><add type="overwrite" place="inline">e</add></subst><choice><orig> Predi-</orig><reg>predicament</reg></choice><note>Bentley (<hi rend="i">Writings</hi> volume 2, page 1321) and Erdman (page 698) read "Standing" as "standing".</note></l><l n="bb208.1.ms.01.17" justify="left">c<subst><del type="overwrite">e</del><add type="overwrite" place="inline">a</add></subst>ment they are in some measure Works of Art &amp; not of Nature or Chance<note>The "c" appearing at the beginning of this line is partially obscured by the verso of the album's previous leaf.
