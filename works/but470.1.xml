    The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of thirty-three of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible.  All take their subjects from the New Testament and have been added to the twenty Old Testament subjects published in March 2010 as “Illustrations to the Bible, c. 1780-1824,” under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.  This new group is presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).
                <lb/><lb/>
                   Blake executed most of these New Testament water colors c. 1800-05 for his patron Thomas Butts.  The exceptions are <hi rend="i">The Whore of Babylon</hi> of 1809 and <hi rend="i">The Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins</hi> in the Yale Center for British Art, datable to c. 1825. The subjects range from the childhood of Jesus to his ascension, the later history of his parents and one of his major followers, St. Paul, and a group of eight designs based on the Book of Revelation.  While the illustrations of the life of Christ are fairly conventional in their subjects, in part because of the long tradition of picturing almost every event in the Gospels, individual motifs recall designs in Blake’s illuminated books and thus offer a window on Blake’s visual interpretation of the Bible. The illustrations of Revelation complement Blake’s intense engagement with apocalyptic events and images in his own poetry.
                    <lb/><lb/>
                        The selection of fifty-three biblical water colors now available in the Archive will be supplemented in the future with early works, such as <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>, datable to c. 1780, and will continue through Blake’s final biblical water colors, such as <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi>. 
                    <lb/><lb/>

The scene takes place in the temple. In the center of the design stands Simeon, portrayed as an old man with long hair and a beard. He wears a gown and faces forward, but looks slightly up. His arms are bent and crossed slightly so that he can support the infant Jesus. In Simeon's arms sits the infant Jesus, nude and facing forward. His legs are bent and his arms are crossed. He has a halo around his head. In the foreground to the left of Simeon's feet, two doves sit or stand on the floor, facing left and slightly forward. Their wings are raised and they appear to be bowing, while looking at Simeon and Jesus. To the left of the doves stands an old woman, Anna, described in Luke 2:36 as a "prophetess."  She faces right. Most of her hair is covered by a veil and she wears a gown, perhaps with a belt at the waist. She has a sandal on her visible right foot, and her right leg is slightly bent. Her arms are bent upward with her palms together as if in prayer or supplication. She is bent forward slightly as she bows and perhaps looks at Jesus. To the right of Simeon in the foreground kneel Joseph and Mary. Joseph has short, curly hair and a beard and kneels, facing left and down. He is slightly hunched forward. His arms are bent and held to his chest. Mary kneels, slightly hunched forward and facing left and down. Her hair is pulled up into a bun that is covered by a veil. She wears a gown and has her arms bent upward and held to her chest. Three male figures stand in the background to the left of Simeon. The leftmost figure has long hair and a beard and wears a gown. He faces right and may look at the figure to his right. The middle figure of this group faces left and slightly forward and may look at the figure to his left. He may wear a gown and has long hair and a beard. The rightmost figure of this group faces forward and has long hair and a beard. He wears a gown. To the right of Simeon in the background stands a group of five male figures, all wearing gowns. The leftmost figure of this group has long hair and a beard and faces forward. The second-to-left figure has short, curly hair and a beard and faces left and slightly forward, looking at Simeon. The middle figure of this group faces left and slightly forward, looking at Simeon and Jesus. He bends his arms to hold his hands together as if in prayer or supplication. The second-to-right figure of this group has long hair and beard and faces left and slightly forward, looking at Simeon. He bends his arms to hold his hands together as if in prayer or supplication. The rightmost figure of this group has short, curly hair and a beard and faces forward and slightly left, and looks down toward Jesus. He bends his arms and holds his hands, palms down and out, fingers spread. Hi gesture and facial expression suggest surprise.
