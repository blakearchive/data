    The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of thirty-three of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible.  All take their subjects from the New Testament and have been added to the twenty Old Testament subjects published in March 2010 as “Illustrations to the Bible, c. 1780-1824,” under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.  This new group is presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).
                <lb/><lb/>
                   Blake executed most of these New Testament water colors c. 1800-05 for his patron Thomas Butts.  The exceptions are <hi rend="i">The Whore of Babylon</hi> of 1809 and <hi rend="i">The Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins</hi> in the Yale Center for British Art, datable to c. 1825. The subjects range from the childhood of Jesus to his ascension, the later history of his parents and one of his major followers, St. Paul, and a group of eight designs based on the Book of Revelation.  While the illustrations of the life of Christ are fairly conventional in their subjects, in part because of the long tradition of picturing almost every event in the Gospels, individual motifs recall designs in Blake’s illuminated books and thus offer a window on Blake’s visual interpretation of the Bible. The illustrations of Revelation complement Blake’s intense engagement with apocalyptic events and images in his own poetry.
                    <lb/><lb/>
                        The selection of fifty-three biblical water colors now available in the Archive will be supplemented in the future with early works, such as <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>, datable to c. 1780, and will continue through Blake’s final biblical water colors, such as <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi>. 
                    <lb/><lb/>

In the center of the design, Jesus stands on a rocky cliff, facing forward but looking down with his arms at his side. He wears a gown and has long, curly hair, a beard, and a halo. The toes of both feet are visible under the hem of the gown. On the lower right of the design is a nude male, facing away and to the right. He is partly upside down and is falling. This is Satan. His legs are bent and partly drawn up and his arms are crossed near his head. The soles of both feet are visible. He has short, curly hair. A cloud of smoke trails or rises in a broad spiral from Satan.
  On the upper left of the design are a group of at least four hovering winged and gowned angels, presumably male. Only the wings, legs, and tops of the heads of the leftmost two angels are visible. The second angel from the right faces away but looks to the right. His left leg is bent backward and his right arm is bent upward, fingers spread. His mouth may be partly open and he has long hair. The rightmost angel faces forward and to the right and looks down, presumably at Satan. He bends his arms upward and holds his palms together as though in prayer or supplication. He has short, curly hair. The angels hover in beams of light that may represent the divine presence or an aura. The sky is mostly clear, with the hint of a cloud on the lower edge of the design, below the cliff.
