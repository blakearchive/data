                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>The leftmost figure of this reunion scene is Joseph, who faces to the right and appears to have descended from a chair or throne, the edge of which is visible atop the raised platform at left. Joseph kneels on the platform with his right knee and lunges forward, stepping down from the platform with his left leg. Part of his bare left foot can be seen planted on the floor in front of the platform. He wears a long-sleeved gown beneath a draping cloth the covers his entire body except for his left foot and his right arm and shoulder. Long, curly hair flows down his back. Joseph leans forward, his head out in front with his eyes lowered and his mouth open. He brings his upper body nearly horizontal as his right arm extends downward and to the right, grasping the left leg of the younger man next to him, likely his brother Benjamin. Joseph's left arm may come alongside his head, and his left hand wraps around Benjamin's left shoulder. Joseph appears to be embracing Benjamin. Second from left, Benjamin kneels with his legs together and his arms crossed over his chest, right over left. His body faces forward and to the left, and his head turns left toward Joseph. Benjamin leans away from Joseph, perhaps resisting his embrace. Benjamin's head tilts downward; his mouth is open, and he may look at Joseph. Benjamin wears a long gown and has long, curly hair that partly covers Joseph's left hand. At right of these figures are the other brothers. Nearest Joseph and Benjamin, three men bow, facing left, in postures of supplication. The most prominent male figure, who is nearest the viewer, stretches his long torso to the left as he extends his forearms along the ground and places his palms flat on the ground. He is nude from the chest up, revealing a muscular back and shoulders. He may wear a skirt over his lower body, which is mostly hidden by the figures at right. The man's lowered head is covered by short, curly hair. Behind this man are two others who also kneel and bow but do not prostrate themselves in the same manner. Both appear to wear gowns or shirts. The nearer of the two men has long hair and a beard. He faces left, hunches his shoulders, and lowers his head. The man further from the viewer has short, curly hair. He also lowers his head, but his face is mostly hidden as he raises his hands to either side of his head, covering it with spread fingers. Behind these kneeling men, a group of seven recoiling figures occupies the right third of the drawing. In the foreground, two men kneel on the ground and lean away from the scene. The man nearer the viewer faces leftward. He bends his knees sharply as both rest on the ground, and he sits on the heels of his bare, flexed feet. As he leans backward over his heels, the man bends both arms at near 90-degree angles as he raises his hands at waist level. His fingers are spread, and his palms face each other. His mouth may open slightly as he stares toward the figures at left with knit brows. He is covered from the waist down by a skirt or draping cloth; his nude chest and arms are muscular. The man has long, wavy hair that extends down his back. The man behind him has short, curly hair and wears a gown that covers him to the elbows. His knees also face left and are bent at a similar angle as both rest on the ground; however, his torso twists away from the scene at left to face the viewer. His shoulders twist even further, nearly facing the right side of the drawing as his right arm bends upward and crosses over his body toward his left side. The man's left arm crosses beneath it so that his left hand touches his right shoulder. His fingers curl into a loose fist. The man's head faces forward and to the left as he looks at the scene in the left two-thirds of the drawing. His mouth opens in astonishment or horror. Behind these men are five others brothers who are only visible from the waist up. They are, from left to right: a long-haired man who faces left and bows his head, closing his eyes and holding his hands in a prayerful posture; another long-haired man who bows his head and raises his hands alongside it, palms facing inward; a short-haired man who faces forward and to the left, raising his right arm horizontally as he leans to the right; the head and short, curly hair of a man who faces forward and to the right, gazing in fear toward the viewer; and a curly-haired man who faces left and lifts his hand to cover his mouth in a contemplative posture. This drawing's setting appears to be a large room or portico with bare floors, a low step at left, and at least one large column in the background. There may be a door or window at right, but otherwise the lines in the background are unclear. Much of this background space is shadowy, with particularly dark areas appearing in the upper lefthand corner, at right of the large column, and in the upper righthand corner. Other shadows appear on both sides of the kneeling woman in the center, beneath the foremost bowing man, and behind the leaning pair at right.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>At right of Joseph and Benjamin are three more brothers who bow, facing left, in postures of supplication. The most prominent male figure, who is nearest the viewer, stretches his long torso to the left as he extends his forearms along the ground and places his palms flat on the ground. He is nude from the chest up, revealing a muscular back and shoulders. He may wear a skirt over his lower body, which is mostly hidden by the figures at right. The man's lowered head is covered by short, curly hair.</illusobjdesc>

As he leans backward over his heels, the man bends both arms at near 90-degree angles as he raises his hands at waist level. His fingers are spread, and his palms face each other. His mouth may open slightly as he stares toward the figures at left with knit brows. He is covered from the waist down by a skirt or draping cloth; his nude chest and arms are muscular. The man has long, wavy hair that extends down his back.</illusobjdesc>

His knees also face left and are bent at a similar angle as both rest on the ground; however, his torso twists away from the scene at left to face the viewer. His shoulders twist even further, nearly facing the right side of the drawing as his right arm bends upward and crosses over his body toward his left side. The man's left arm crosses beneath it so that his left hand touches his right shoulder. His fingers curl into a loose fist. The man's head faces forward and to the left as he looks at the scene in the left two-thirds of the drawing. His mouth opens in astonishment or horror.</illusobjdesc>
