            <updatestmt>
                The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of seventeen pen and ink drawings by Blake. Ranging chronologically from his apprenticeship as an engraver to the final decade of his life, this group offers a comprehensive overview of his work in the medium. Most were created when Blake was learning his craft as an artist and reveal his exploration of various themes and genres. His apprentice drawings for James Basire (<hi rend="i">The Body of Edward I and Countess Aveline</hi>) show his early engagement with medieval art. Another group (two drawings titled <hi rend="i">Figures from a Greek Vase</hi> and <hi rend="i">Charon</hi>) is clearly based on classical art or mythology, responses to which were central to British art and design in the second half of the eighteenth century. The cluster of related sketches on two leaves, each titled <hi rend="i">Four Composition Sketches</hi>, is the earliest extant example of Blake’s attempt to construct a pictorial narrative through a series of images. In these, he began to develop his own version of the sublime, an aesthetic more fully represented by the texts and designs in the illuminated books of the 1790s. Several works from the 1780s show the influence of neoclassicism and take their subjects from two fields of lasting interest to Blake: British history (<hi rend="i">King Alfred</hi>, <hi rend="i">A Woman Enthroned</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Procession of Monks</hi>) and the Bible (<hi rend="i">Saul and David</hi>, <hi rend="i">Goliath Cursing David</hi>, and two versions of <hi rend="i">The Good Farmer</hi>). The three much later drawings are exceptions to Blake’s customary procedures and subjects: a landscape <hi rend="i">Garden Path</hi>, <hi rend="i">The Prophet Isaiah</hi> drawn on a woodblock for a wood engraving never executed, and <hi rend="i">Lady Torrens</hi>, a copy of a family portrait by his friend and patron John Linnell.<lb/>
                <lb/>
                Blake did not execute a large number of pen and ink drawings. This is a bit surprising, given the compatibility between the linearity of the medium and his insistence on “the distinct, sharp, and wirey ... bounding line” as the “great and golden rule of art” (Blake’s <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi>). He did, however, make extensive use of pen and ink work to outline forms in his water colors, color prints, and hand tinted relief etchings in the illuminated books. For preliminary sketching, Blake favored pencil over pen and ink, probably because of the lower cost of pencil and the ease of erasure and correction it offered. The Archive will publish his pencil sketches decade by decade, beginning with the earliest works, 1779 through 1790.<lb/>
                <lb/>
                This is the first time that works from the Society of Antiquaries, London have been represented in the Archive. Accordingly, we are also publishing the Society's Blake collection list, which includes all of its original works by Blake, not just those published in the Archive, and joins the Collection Lists of over thirty other contributing institutions.<lb/>
                <lb/>
                As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees.

                    <illusobjdesc>Five mythological figures and one animal, a bull, stand or walk in this scene representing a Bacchic Mystery.  The bull occupies the center of the composition where it moves rightward with both front legs raised.  This animal represents Bacchus in the form of a bull.  In front of Bacchus is a winged female figure wearing a long gown and a spiky crown.  She walks rightward with her right leg and appears to pull with both hands on a string or rope attached to the bull's head.  This figure represents Genius, either Acratus in female guise or Ariadne.  In addition to the bull Bacchus and the female figure, there are four male attendants, all of whom have short curly hair, prominent genitals, and are nude except for a length of drapery and a hat or crown. The first attendant stands to the right of the bull, which he attempts to lead rightward with his right arm.  He holds a long torch in his left hand.  A second male attendant, upper left, faces and strides right.  He holds what appears to be a torch in his right hand (though the flame is not visible) and raises his bent left arm, which is draped.  The third male attendant stands directly above the bull in the center of the composition.  Although his body faces left, he turns his head to the right and extends both arms horizontally with hands raised and palms facing outward.  Drapery covers both of his shoulders.  The fourth male attendant, upper right, stands facing left with a torch in his left hand and drapery covering both shoulders.

                        <illusobjdesc>Five mythological figures and one animal, a bull, stand or walk in this scene representing a Bacchic Mystery.  In front of the bull is a winged female figure wearing a long, intricately decorated gown and a spiky crown.  She has short, curly hair and faces right.  With right leg extended forward and left bent back at the knee, she appears to walk right, perhaps leading the bull.  Both of her arms are bent at the elbow, and she holds a length of string or rope in both hands that is attached to the bull's head.  She may be pulling this rope, forcing the bull to meet her downward gaze.  This figure represents Genius, either Acratus in female guise or Ariadne.</illusobjdesc>

In addition to the bull Bacchus and the female figure, there are four male attendants, all of whom have short curly hair, prominent genitals, and are nude except for a length of drapery and a particular hat or crown.  The first of these stands to the right of the bull, which he attempts to lead rightward with his right arm.  This arm is extended and he may grasp or hold the horns of the bull.  In his left hand, the figure holds a long torch.  Facing right but looking left at the bull, this figure bends his left leg at the knee and extends his right backward, which suggests he is walking.</illusobjdesc>

In addition to the bull Bacchus and the female figure, there are four male attendants, all of whom have short curly hair, prominent genitals, and are nude except for a length of drapery and a particular hat or crown.  The second attendant stands or walks in the upper left corner of the scene.  Facing right, he carries what is likely a torch (though the flame is not visible) in his right hand with bent right arm while he raises his bent left arm horizontally.  Drapery covers this arm as well as his left shoulder.  Both legs are slightly bent and suggest he is walking.</illusobjdesc>

His left arm is bent and he holds a torch in his left hand; his right arm is bent upward with hand pointed toward the right, perhaps in a directional gesture for the other figures.  His left leg is slightly bent and raised, resulting in a contrapposto stance.</illusobjdesc>
