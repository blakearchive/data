                <compdate value="1779">c. 1778-85?<note>The date of this work is far from certain.  Blake may have executed this drawing while still an apprentice to James Basire, 1772-79.  See also the companion drawing, *Figures from a Greek Vase, after D'Hancarville: The Apotheosis of Bacchus*, Butlin 174.  The reference to Alexander Gilchrist's biography of Blake, first published in 1863, in Tatham's inscription suggests that he did not write this note until that date or later.</note>

                    <illusobjdesc>Five mythological figures and one animal, a bull, stand or walk in this scene representing a Bacchic Mystery.  The bull occupies the center of the composition where it moves rightward with both front legs raised.  This animal represents Bacchus in the form of a bull.  In front of Bacchus is a winged female figure wearing a long gown and a spiky crown.  She walks rightward with her right leg and appears to pull with both hands on a string or rope attached to the bull's head.  This figure represents Genius, either Acratus in female guise or Ariadne.  In addition to the bull Bacchus and the female figure, there are four male attendants, all of whom have short curly hair, prominent genitals, and are nude except for a length of drapery and a hat or crown. The first attendant stands to the right of the bull, which he attempts to lead rightward with his right arm.  He holds a long torch in his left hand.  A second male attendant, upper left, faces and strides right.  He holds what appears to be a torch in his right hand (though the flame is not visible) and raises his bent left arm, which is draped.  The third male attendant stands directly above the bull in the center of the composition.  Although his body faces left, he turns his head to the right and extends both arms horizontally with hands raised and palms facing outward.  Drapery covers both of his shoulders.  The fourth male attendant, upper right, stands facing left with a torch in his left hand and drapery covering both shoulders.  This drawing is a copy of an engraving of a Greek vase painting in D'Hancarville (P. F. Hugues), *Antiquités etrusques, grecques et romaines, tirées du cabinet de M. Hamilton*, Naples 1766-67, volume 3, plate 36.</illusobjdesc>

In front of the bull is a winged female figure wearing a long, intricately decorated gown and a spiky crown.  She has short, curly hair and faces right.  With right leg extended forward and left bent back at the knee, she appears to walk right, perhaps leading the bull.  Both of her arms are bent at the elbow, and she holds a length of string or rope in both hands that is attached to the bull's head.  She may be pulling this rope, forcing the bull to meet her downward gaze.  This figure represents Genius, either Acratus in female guise or Ariadne.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>Five mythological figures and one animal, a bull, stand or walk in this scene representing a Bacchic Mystery.  In addition to the bull Bacchus and the female figure, there are four male attendants, all of whom have short curly hair, prominent genitals, and are nude except for a length of drapery and a particular hat or crown.  The first of these stands to the right of the bull, which he attempts to lead rightward with his right arm.  This arm is extended and he may grasp or hold the horns of the bull.  In his left hand, the figure holds a long torch.  Facing right but looking left at the bull, this figure bends his left leg at the knee and extends his right backward, which suggests he is walking.</illusobjdesc>

In addition to the bull Bacchus and the female figure, there are four male attendants, all of whom have short curly hair, prominent genitals, and are nude except for a length of drapery and a particular hat or crown.  The second attendant stands or walks in the upper left corner of the scene.  Facing right, he carries what is likely a torch (though the flame is not visible) in his right hand with bent right arm while he raises his bent left arm horizontally.  Drapery covers this arm as well as his left shoulder.  Both legs are slightly bent and suggest he is walking.</illusobjdesc>

His left leg is slightly bent at the knee and drapery covers both of his shoulders.</illusobjdesc>

In addition to the bull Bacchus and the female figure, there are four male attendants, all of whom have short curly hair, prominent genitals, and are nude except for a length of drapery and a particular hat or crown.  The fourth attendant stands facing left beside the upper right margin of the scene.  His left arm is bent and he holds a torch in his left hand; his right arm is bent upward with hand pointed toward the right, perhaps in a directional gesture for the other figures.  His left leg is slightly bent and raised, resulting in a contrapposto stance.</illusobjdesc>
