                        described in Matthew 14:15-21. In the center stands Jesus, with long hair, a
                        beard, and a halo (the halo no much decayed). He faces forward and wears a
                        gown. His arms are bent at the elbow with his right palm facing out, as
                        though blessing, and his left arm is holding what appears to be two loaves
                        of bread. Three of the Evangelists, probably Matthew, Mark, and Luke, stand
                        on the left. The leftmost of this group faces left and is bending down
                        slightly to look at the man to whom he hands bread. He has short, curly hair
                        and a beard, and wears a gown. In his left arm, which is bent, he holds what
                        appear to be three loaves of bread. His right arm is at his side, and he
                        uses that hand to give out another loaf. The middle of the apostles to the
                        left of Jesus faces forward. He has curly hair and a beard and wears a gown.
                        His eyes appear to be closed or cast sharply down. In his arms, which are
                        crossed, he appears to hold two loaves of bread and a fish. The rightmost of
                        the apostles to the left of Jesus faces right and slightly forward. He has a
                        beard and wears a gown, and appears to be looking at Jesus. At least his
                        left hand is raised, palm out. The largest figure right of Jesus and just
                        within the right margin is probably John, the youngest Evangelist. He faces
                        right, though with his head turned slightly forward. He bends forward to
                        hand food to someone past the edge of the image. He wears a gown and has
                        long, possibly curly hair. His right arm is raised at 45 degrees and bent
                        slightly. He holds with is left hand a cloth, or a part of his gown, which
                        may contain a loaf of bread visible just left of his right upper arm. The
                        suggestion of the multitudes gathered to hear Jesus preach and to be fed by
                        him is made by a number of groups of figures, most of which are indistinct.
                        There are two groups of huddled figures to the left of the leftmost
                        disciple, one in the background and one in the foreground. The group in the
                        background is particularly indistinct and could contain any numbers of
                        bodies, but there is the suggestion of the back of at least one figure,
                        sitting and facing right. In the group in the foreground, two figures are
                        distinguishable, male(?) child facing forward and an old man with a beard.
                        The old man is seated, probably gowned, ans with his left arm bent upward to
                        receive a loaf of bread from the apostle to the right. Between Jesus and the
                        apostle to his right are two groups of huddled figures, one in the
                        background and one in the middle ground. There may be ten or more figures in
                        the group in the background. Two figures of indeterminate gender are
                        somewhat distinguishable in the center of this group. The figure to the left
                        sits, facing left, with its legs extended in front of it. Its left arm may
                        be resting on its left thigh, and bent upward. The figure to the right lies,
                        propped up on its right arm, which is bent at the elbow. It faces right and
                        extends its legs in front of it. In the group in the middle ground, three
                        heads are visible on the left side of the group. Their gender is
                        indeterminable and they face right and forward. Directly below them is
                        visible the head of what may be an old man in a gown, with long hair and a
                        beard, facing right. On the right side of this group, two figures are
                        distinguishable. The figure to the left may be a woman in a gown, facing
                        left. The figure to the right is an old man in a gown, with long hair and a
                        beard, facing left. His visible left arm is bent toward his chest, as though
                        his arms are crossed. His right leg is extended backward, and both his legs
                        are bent as though he is walking to the left. Given the similarity of his
                        pose to that of the disciples in the foreground, he may be a disciple
                        handing out food. In the foreground right of Christ, a nude young male with
                        short, curly hair is seen from behind. He looks up to his left at Jesus. His
                        left leg is extended backward and is on tiptoe. His arms are bent with the
                        palms held vertically and out and the fingers spread. His size suggests that
                        he is a child. In the crook of his right arm he holds a wicker basket. Above
                        John, the Evangelist far right, are two groups of huddled figures, one atop
                        a hill in the background and one midway down the hill. There may be seven or
                        more figures in the group atop the hill. The only one clearly
                        distinguishable sits, facing left, with its legs extended in front and bent
                        slightly. There may be four or more figures in the group midway up the hill.
                        The face of the leftmost figure is visible, facing right and slightly
                        forward. There may be a group of huddled figures just above John's right
                        lower arm. Three figures are distinguishable below and to the right of John.
                        The leftmost figure is that of a nude child with short hair. This child
                        faces right and slightly forward, and has its right arm bent upward to hold
                        what appears to be a loaf of bread. Its left leg is extended backward and is
                        on tiptoe, and both legs are bent to suggest that he(?) is walking to the
                        right. The middle figure is that of a nude infant with short hair, being
                        suckled. It faces right, with its head turned forward and its right arm bent
                        upward to hold its mother's breast. The rightmost figure is that of a woman,
                        with long, curly hair pulled up into a bun. Her breasts are exposed, but she
                        may wear a skirt or have some other kind of cloth secured around her waist.
                        She is sitting, facing left and forward, with her legs bent and drawn up
                        slightly. Her arms are bent so that she can support with both hands the
                        infant she is feeding. She may be looking at the child to the left who is
                        carrying a loaf of bread. The foreground beneath Jesus and the apostles is
                        grassy, as is the top of a hill in the background, far upper right. The sky
                        appears to be cloudy. </illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>Christ</characteristic><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>halo</characteristic><characteristic>aura</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>bread</characteristic><characteristic>arms bent</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>palm vertical</characteristic><characteristic>palm out</characteristic><characteristic>hand raised, palm out</characteristic><characteristic>blessing</characteristic><illusobjdesc>In the center stands Jesus, with long hair, a beard, and a

                            forward. He has a beard and wears a gown, and appears to be looking at
                            Jesus.

                            disciple, one in the background and one in the foreground. The group in
                            the background is particularly indistinct and could contain any numbers
                            of bodies, but there is the suggestion of the back of at least one
                            figure, sitting and facing right. In the group in the foreground, two
                            figures are distinguishable, male(?) child facing forward and an old man
                            with a beard. The old man is seated, probably gowned, ans with his left
                            arm bent upward to receive a loaf of bread from the apostle to the
                            right. </illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="B"><characteristic>group of figures</characteristic><characteristic>huddled</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>sitting</characteristic><characteristic>legs extended</characteristic><characteristic>legs together</characteristic><characteristic>arm resting</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>lying</characteristic><characteristic>resting</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Between Jesus and the apostle to the right are two groups of

                            the group in the middle ground, three heads are visible to the left side
                            of the group. Their gender is indeterminable and they face right and
                            forward. Directly below them is visible the head of what may be an old
                            man in a gown, with long hair and a beard, facing right. On the right
                            side of this group, two figures are distinguishable. The figure to the
                            left may be a woman in a gown, facing left. The figure to the right is
                            an old man in a gown, with long hair and a beard, facing left. His
                            visible left arm is bent toward his chest, as though his arms are
                            crossed. His right leg is extended backward, and both his legs are bent
                            as though he is walking to the left. Given the similarity of his pose to
                            that of the disciples in the foreground, he may be a disciple handing
                            out food.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="D"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>child</characteristic><characteristic>young</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>seen from behind</characteristic><characteristic>facing away</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>facing up</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>leg extended backward</characteristic><characteristic>tiptoe</characteristic><characteristic>arms bent</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>basket</characteristic><characteristic>wicker</characteristic><characteristic>palms vertical</characteristic><characteristic>palms out</characteristic><characteristic>hands raised, palms out</characteristic><characteristic>fingers spread</characteristic><characteristic>short hair</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Between Jesus and the apostle to the right is a nude male with

                            child with short hair. This child faces right and slightly forward, and
                            has its right arm bent upward to hold what appears to be a loaf of
                            bread. Its left leg is extended backward and is on tiptoe, and both legs
                            are bent to suggest that he(?) is walking to the right. The middle
                            figure is that of a nude infant with short hair being suckled. It faces
                            right, with its head turned forward and its right arm bent upward to
                            hold its mother's breast. The rightmost figure is that of a woman, with
                            long, curly hair pulled up into a bun. Her breasts are uncovered, but
                            may wear a skirt or have some other kind of cloth secured around her
                            waist. She is sitting, facing left and forward, with her legs bent and
                            drawn up slightly. Her arms are bent so that she can support the infant
                            she is breast feeding with both hands. She may be looking at the child
