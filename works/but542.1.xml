            The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce  the publication of electronic editions of Blake’s illustrations to John Milton’s "On the Morning of Christ’s Nativity" and <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi>. The six "Nativity Ode" water colors were acquired, and probably commissioned, by Thomas Butts in about 1815. This series is now in the Huntington Library and Art Gallery. The group of three <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi> water colors was acquired, and almost certainly commissioned, by John Linnell in 1822. The first two designs are now in the National Gallery of Victoria; the third is in the Fitzwilliam Museum. Both sets are presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (our image annotation program). With this publication, the Archive now contains all nine of Blake's series of water colors illustrating Milton's poetry.<lb/><lb/>
            Blake had created six "Nativity Ode" illustrations for the Rev. Joseph Thomas in 1809. Blake repeated the same basic designs, with many minor but intriguing variations, in the Butts set presented here. When sold at auction in 1852, the water colors were accompanied by the poem, or possibly only the passages illustrated, in manuscript. This text, possibly in Blake's hand, is now untraced. In comparison to the earlier series, the Butts water colors are more highly finished and show careful attention to interior modeling and detailed coloring.<lb/><lb/>
            Blake produced twelve <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi> water colors for Thomas in 1807 and a similar set of twelve for Butts in 1808. It may have been Blake's intention to execute another set of twelve illustrations for Linnell, but only the three extant designs are known. They are based on the fourth, eighth, and eleventh illustrations in the Butts series. In comparison to these models, the Linnell water colors show an increased emphasis on dramatic lighting, particularly evident in the radiance surrounding Christ in the third design, "Michael Foretells the Crucifixion." The Job engravings, commissioned by Linnell in 1823, show a similarly masterful use of intense illumination.<lb/><lb/>

The coloristic effects and delicate surfaces built with small brush strokes in the "Nativity Ode" designs associate them with Blake's illustrations to Milton's *Paradise Regained*, "L'Allegro," and "Il Penseroso," all of which include designs on paper with an 1816 watermark.  The lapidary surfaces of these works, dated to c. 1816-20 in Butlin, are more highly wrought than in the "Nativity Ode" water colors, and thus a date of c. 1815 seems likely.</note></compdate></objdescid><objinfo><numberobj>6</numberobj><objorder>1-6</objorder><objsize>each approximately 16.0 x 12.5 cm.</objsize><numberleaves>6</numberleaves><leafsize>approximately 16.0 x 12.5 cm.</leafsize><medium>pen and water color</medium><support>wove paper</support><watermark>IVY MILL<note>The watermark appears on all 6 objects.</note></watermark><pennednumbers>none</pennednumbers><framelines>none</framelines></objinfo><provenance n="1"><name>Henry E.

(£6.12s.6d. to the dealer Henry G. Bohn); B. G. Windus; probably by inheritance or gift  to his daughter, Mrs. J. K. de Putron, by 1863; sold anonymously at Christie's, 16 March 1912, lot 6 (£336 to the dealer Frank T. Sabin); offered by the Rosenbach Company, December 1912 catalogue, item 11 (not priced) and in Rosenbach's November 1913 catalogue 17, item 61 ($9500); sold October 1916, with Blake's *Satan, Sin, and Death* (Butlin 536.2), to Henry E. Huntington ($10,000, according to Rosenbach's receipt in the Huntington archives).  The manuscript copy of the poem sold with the water colors in 1852 may have included only the passages illustrated, not the entire poem.  Butlin 542 claims, without providing any evidence, that this manuscript contained "Milton's verses in Blake's hand," apparently like those Blake wrote in pen and ink on separate sheets that accompany his illustrations to Milton's "L'Allegro" and "Il Penseroso" (Butlin 543).  This manuscript may have been lost or discarded prior to the 1912 auction, the catalogue of which makes no mention of such texts.  Until 1993, the "Nativity Ode" water colors were pasted to backing mats, probably made for Rosenbach, with passages from the poem written below each design in fine italic script.  The relationship, if any, between these mat inscriptions and the earlier manuscript is not known.</note></provenance><repository><institution>Henry E.

               of Peace may represent the star of Bethlehem.  A stable stands below the Spirit of Peace.  The roof may be thatched straw, and we view

               Her head, surrounded by a halo, is bent back and she leans or rests against Joseph in a posture suggesting exhaustion.  Joseph stands to the 
               right of Mary and faces left.  He bends forward at the waist and holds Mary's head with his left arm.  His head is surrounded by a halo 
               of light.  To the left of the infant Christ, Elizabeth kneels with the young John the Baptist seated on her lap, both with hands raised toward the hovering Christ child.  Above and to the left of Elizabeth we see the head and right shoulder of Zacharias.  Above and to the left of the infant Christ are the heads of two horned cows or oxen.  Below the stable, 
               the Spirit of Nature lies on her side partially buried in the earth.  Her head is turned up and she looks toward the 
               Spirit of Peace.  The ground may be covered with snow.  Stalks of grain (or possibly vines on poles) grow left and right

The host of angels consists of 
               five winged males (presumably Cherubim) in the center with nine or more females (Seraphim?) in a circle around them.  The central angels are 
               nude and stand with their arms raised at 135 degrees.  The second and fourth angels from 
               the left are partially obscured by the arms of the other angels.  The circle of angels appear to be gowned females, several of whom hold 
               and play instruments.  The pair of angels at the base of the circle are winged and play horns, possibly trumpets.  The angels towards the top of the circle 
               are indistinct and appear as little more than outlines of heads and shoulders.  The host of angels is surrounded by a halo with beams of 
               light radiating outward.  Below, the group of shepherds consists of three females, three males, the outline of a human (?) head of indeterminate gender, and one child of indeteminate gender seated 
               on the leftmost figure's lap.  All of the figures are gowned; the female figures also wear cloth scarves or veils.  Several of the figures 
               hold their hands together in prayer and most look up toward the angels.  The central shepherd (sixth from the left) sits on a stone with his 
               right leg bent backward.  He is seen from behind with his arms bent and his palms facing away from the viewer.  A dog is seen from behind 
               between the second and third figures from the right.  A flock of sheep lies behind the group of shepherds, extending left and right.  Most 
               appear as indistinct shapes.  In the foreground, left and right, is a dog (left) possibly with a collar and a ram with curled horn.  They may be 
               sleeping.  Above and to the right of the shepherds are two tents.  A distant view of the stable is pictured between the 
               shepherds and the angels.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="AB"><characteristic>group of figures</characteristic><characteristic>angel</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>wing</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>hovering</characteristic><characteristic>flying</characteristic><characteristic>arms raised at 135 degrees</characteristic><characteristic>hat</characteristic><characteristic>feather</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>hands raised, palms out</characteristic><characteristic>hands raised, palms up</characteristic><characteristic>fingers spread</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Five nude angels stand in a row in the top half of the design.

Three robed or cloaked figures, possibly the three wise men, kneel below the arch, facing away from the viewer.  A trail of thirteen stars appears

               The dragon (possibly Typhon) sits on a stone with his legs bent and crossed.  He holds a sword in his left hand and a scepter (with a pomegranate finial) in his right.   
               Typhon has seven heads, most of which are bent back and look towards the Nativity scene above.  All of the heads appear to have one or two small

               of arrows on his back (the arrows are visible over his right shoulder) and a cape or other drapery rests over his left arm.  To the left of Apollo, a serpent is 
               coiled around a pillar.  The spirit of Apollo emanates from the statue in a tongue of light or fire.  The figure is seen from behind and bends 
               to the left while upside down.  His arms are raised vertically (relative to his body).  Below the spirit 
               of Apollo, a small (gowned?) figure hovers or flies above a seascape.  A fire with smoke burns on the altar below the statue.  A colonnade

The figure is seen from behind 
               and flies on outstretched arms from which extend bat-like wings.  The figure has both legs bent and the soles 
               of his feet turned out towards the viewer.  His left arm is raised horizontally while his right is raised at 135 degrees.  Both palms are 
               turned downward.  Below is an altar to Moloch composed of a large furnace and a statue of Moloch with three infants.  Fire erupts from the three openings in 
               the furnace (right, left, and forward) and also rise to the left and right of the statue.  Smoke rises from the fire and fills the sky to the right 
               of the fleeing spirit.  The statue wears a crown and holds a scepter in his right hand.  His right arm is bent and rests on a stone to the left.  
               His left arm is at his side, and he holds the limp, upside-down body of a child or infant in his left hand.  
               Two other infants stand or kneel below and to the left of Moloch.  They face right and reach towards Moloch with their arms 
               raised vertically.  Below the furnace, a nude male 
               infant stands surrounded by flames.  His arms are raised vertically, fingers spread.  The infant may be a victim sacrificed to Moloch or may possibly 
               represent the infant Christ.  A male and gowned female kneel to the right and left of the infant respectively; they 
               may be his parents.  The female figure twists to the left.  Her right arm is bent up toward her face with the fingers on her right hand spread.  Her left arm 
               is raised horizontally and extended towards the child with the palm held vertically.  Her mouth is open and she may be howling or shrieking; 
               her expression suggests grief or anguish.  The male figure twists to the right and is seen from behind.  His right arm is bent and his right 
               hand covers his face.  His left arm is raised horizontally and extended towards the child with the palm held vertically.  His posture 
               suggests grief.  Left of the furnace, two bearded, gowned males stand with their arms raised vertically. Both hold a pair of cymbals.  Their 
               mouths are open and they may be singing.  Right of the furnace, three gowned female figures stand with their arms raised vertically holding 
               cymbals.  The figures are seen from behind; the rightmost figure twists to the right at the waist to face the viewer.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="AB"><characteristic>Moloch</characteristic><characteristic>spirit</characteristic><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>bald</characteristic><characteristic>twisted</characteristic><characteristic>seen from behind</characteristic><characteristic>wing</characteristic><characteristic>bat-winged</characteristic><characteristic>spiky</characteristic><characteristic>bending right</characteristic><characteristic>legs bent</characteristic><characteristic>leg drawn up</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised horizontally</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised 135 degrees</characteristic><characteristic>palms down</characteristic><characteristic>buttocks</characteristic><characteristic>flying</characteristic><characteristic>fleeing</characteristic><characteristic>facing away</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>facing up</characteristic><illusobjdesc>At the top of the design, the spirit of Moloch flees from his altar below.

The Virgin Mary kneels on the floor 
               of the stable.  She is gowned with her arms down at her sides and her left foot visible.  A halo of light surrounds her head, which rests 
               against the figure of Christ to the left.  The infant Christ lies or reclines on a bed of straw, perhaps supported by a manger, to the left of Mary.  He is gowned.  A 
               halow of light surrounds his entire body.  He leans to the right and rests his head against that of Mary.  Joseph stands to the right of 
               Mary and bends left over her.  He is gowned and may wear a cloth scarf over his head.  His left arm is bent and he may rest his head on his 
               left arm or hand.  All three figures have their eyes closed and may be sleeping.  Two pairs of angels appear as mirror images left and 
               right of the stable.  One pair stands with their wings extended along the roof of the stable.  Each may wear a cloth scarf or hood, although the headgear of the standing angel on the left may be a helmet.  
               Each bends a single visible arm upward and may hold a spear.  A total of six spears are pictured, three to either side of the stable; this arrangement hints at the presence of four more angels behind those that are pictured standing in front of the spears.  A 
               pair of winged angels sit or crouch below.  Both are gowned and wear hats or helmets decorated with feathers.  The figure to the left bends his left arm across his 
               chest and holds a sword with the blade's tip resting on the ground.  The figure to the right bends his right arm across his chest and also 
               holds a sword.  The ground below appears to be made of clouds or possibly drifts of snow.  Above the stable, two gowned angels hover or fly on outstretched wings.  
               Both hold and play harps.  The figure to the left is seen from behind and faces away from the viewer.  The figure to the right faces right 
               with his or her head turned toward the viewer.  Between these angels, a gowned female (the personification of the star of Bethlehem) sits 
               in a chariot holding a lit oil lamp in her left hand.  To the left of the chariot, two horses lie facing left.  The chariot
