                    <illusobjdesc>Three adults and two children stand facing forward under a yoke against a dark background in this drawing.  At center, an old male figure with curly hair and a long beard looks forward with an open mouth.  The adult at right is a nude male figure with short curly hair whose arms are also visible above the elbow before being bent behind his back.  He turns his head to look left and stands in a contrapposto position with left foot slightly lifted while his right ankle is shackled.  There appears to be a chain around his waist, possibly also dangling vertically over his lower torso.  The adult at left is a nude female figure with long hair who turns her head to look right.  With both arms extended downward in front of her, she attempts to cover her genitals while holding in her right hand a length of chain extending from the yoke.  A nude child stands beside her and may lean against her left leg.  With head down and arms possibly bent upward, the child extends its left leg backward.  An older child, also nude, stands between the two male adult figures and turns his head to look right and up.  His right leg is bent backward at the knee.  A yoke that appears to be made of wood rests across the shoulders of the three adult figures.  Two lengths of chain dangle from each end of the yoke: at left, the female figure holds the chain in front of her genitals, and at right, the chain may be connected to the male figure's hands behind his back (not pictured) and then extend downward to connect to the shackle visible around his right ankle.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>A yoke that appears to be made of wood rests across the shoulders of the three adult figures.  Two lengths of chain dangle from each end of the yoke: at left, the female figure holds the chain in front of her genitals, and at right, the chain may be connected to the male figure's hands behind his back (not pictured) and then extend downward to connect to the shackle visible around his right ankle.  There appears to be a chain around his waist, possibly also dangling vertically over his lower torso.</illusobjdesc>
