                    painted by Michelangelo in the Sistine Chapel. They were very probably copied from the engravings of Adamo Ghisi, after drawings by Giorgio Ghisi, 
                    published in *Pitture dipinte nella Volta della Capella Sistina nel Vaticano* (1773). 
                    The wash drawing, *Aminadab, Called "The Reposing Traveller"*, is on the verso of this leaf.</p>
                    <p>Frederick Tatham added a pen and ink inscription in the lower right corner of the leafing bearing this drawing.</p></objnote>

                    <illusobjdesc>This wash drawing, after a portion of Michelangelo’s Sistine Ceiling, shows a male figure seated on a large block. It is presumably the figure Manasses. He sits hunched forward facing right and his back is severely arched. He looks downward. His chin is to his chest and his eyes and mouth are closed. A prominent wart or other growth is visible on his chin.  His arms are extended to rest on his legs and his hands are crossed at the wrist. His right hand cups his left knee, while his left hand dangles with slightly spread fingers. His left leg is drawn up at an exaggerated angle and bends at the knee to cross over his right leg while his bare left foot dangles. His right left bends at the knee and his right heel rests against the block. He wears a long tunic and a hood covers his head. The block on which the man sits rests on a bare floor. The background is plain, perhaps representing a bare wall behind the man. </illusobjdesc>
