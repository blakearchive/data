                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>The leftmost figure of this reunion scene is Joseph, who faces to the right and steps in that direction from the drawing's left border. He strides forward with his right leg; his bare right foot is planted on the floor, but his left foot remains outside the frame. He wears a long-sleeved gown, the hem of which curls in a circular pattern as it floats near ankle height. Joseph wears a crown and his hair curls into ringlets at his shoulders. As he steps into the frame, Joseph leans forward, and his shoulders hunch as his head turns downward; his eyes are lowered, and his mouth is open. His arms extend downward and to the right, wrapping around the upper body of the younger man next to him, likely his brother Benjamin. Joseph's right arm appears prominently, but his left arm is signified only by the presence of his left hand behind Benjamin. Joseph's fingers are spread as he embraces his brother. Second from left, Benjamin rises to meet Joseph and return his embrace. He lunges to the left with his legs bent at near-right angles; his right leg bends forward with the right foot on the floor beside Joseph's. Benjamin's left foot flexes behind him. Benjamin's bare left arm extends upward to grasp Joseph around the ribs; his right arm is not visible but likely embraces Joseph on the other side. Benjamin's head tilts upward, and he gazes toward Joseph's face. Benjamin wears a long gown that is drawn aside to reveal most of his right leg. His wavy hair comes to shoulder length. At right of these figures are nine other men, presumably their brothers. They appear in two groups: near Joseph and Benjamin, four men bow, facing left, in postures of supplication; behind them, five men recoil from the scene. Immediately behind Benjamin's head, two brothers stand or kneel, facing left. Only the head of the brother at left is visible; he has long hair and looks downward. Some lines at left of his head could represent his hands. The brother at right also has long hair. He bends forward, tilting his head downward and raising his hands together in a prayerful posture. He appears to be looking at the ground. Below these two is the head of another brother who bows low but lifts his head to look forward. Below him, another man kneels in a contracted posture, lowering his head and covering his face with his hands. Behind these bowing men is a group of five others who lean backward as if recoiling from the scene before them. Nearest the viewer are two men who face leftward, kneel on the ground, and lean backward dramatically. The man nearer the viewer faces leftward. He bends his knees sharply as both rest on the ground, and he sits on the heels of his bare, flexed feet. The man appears to be nude, and his left arm extends downward to cover his genitals. His right arm bends upward across his body, and his right hand touches his left shoulder. The man has short, curly hair and a beard of similar texture. The man behind him, appearing at left, has long hair and a long beard. A gown covers most of his body but leaves his right shoulder bare. He also faces left and kneels, leaning backward; as he does so, the man's right arm extends downward near his right knee. His left arm wraps around the body of the short-haired brother beside him, and his left hand rests on this brother's left hip. Behind these men are at least three others brothers. Leftmost in this group is a man who with short, curly hair and a beard who faces forward and to the left. The man raises his hands out in front of him with his palms facing outward and his fingers spread. Below his right hand appears the cuff of his shirt or gown. Immediately to the right of this man is another who faces left and stares toward Joseph and Benjamin. He has long hair, and his back may be visible behind the kneeling pair below. Rightmost in the group is a man in similar posture. He faces left and may look toward the reunion scene, but his features are not as well defined and his eyes may be closed. Lines over and beside his head may represent hair, but they may also suggest the presence of another figure. This drawing's setting appears to be a large room or portico with bare floors. Some lines appear in the background, but their import is unclear. The only noteworthy shadows appear between Joseph and Benjamin's legs, and behind the group of figures at right.</illusobjdesc>
