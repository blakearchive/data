Later interpreters identified the three human figures as the triple form of the classical moon goddess and witch, and further associated the image with the reference to "triple Hecat's team" in Shakespeare's *A Midsummer Night's Dream*, Act 5, scene 1.  In 1990, the art historian Gert Schiff proposed a different textual source, Blake's own *Europe a Prophecy*, Plate 5, lines 1-9 (Erdman page 62).  In Schiff's interpretation, the front-most figure is Enitharmon, a representative of mystery, fallen nature, and sexual repression in *Europe*.  She separates and imprisons the youthful female (left) and male (right); her minions are creatures of the night (the owl and monstrous bats) or of ignorance (the ass and the lizard or toad).  Schiff's title, "The Night of Enitharmon's Joy," is taken from a passage in *Europe* and has been generally accepted by Blake scholars.</p></objnote><objsize>41.5 x 55.9 cm.</objsize><windowsize width="600" height="550"/></physdesc><illusdesc><illustration type="plate" location="E"><illusobjdesc>Slightly to the right of the center, Enitharmon (or Hecate) sits with her legs drawn up to her chest and crossed, while looking to the left and slightly down. She appears to be nude except for the black gown draping her legs. Her left hand is holding a book open, while pointing to the book’s text. Two nude figures, perhaps a female (right of Enitharmon/Hecate) and a male (left) are behind Enitharmon. Only their side profiles are visible as they shield their faces away from the viewer. A donkey enters from the left and munches on some foliage in the lower left corner of the design. Behind the donkey is a rocky terrain. Nestled within the rocks is a peeking lizard (?) revealing only its head. Behind the lizard and farther up on the rocks, is an owl. In the distance on the right, an anthropomorphic bat flies above the heads of the three figures. Even farther in the distance along the right margin, an outline of another flying bat appears.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="BD"><characteristic>Hecate</characteristic><characteristic>Enitharmon</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>cloak</characteristic><characteristic>drapery</characteristic><characteristic>hem</characteristic><characteristic>partly nude</characteristic><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>legs drawn up</characteristic><characteristic>legs crossed</characteristic><characteristic>feet</characteristic><characteristic>hand</characteristic><characteristic>partly nude</characteristic><characteristic>arms at side</characteristic><characteristic>touching</characteristic><characteristic>pointing</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>facing down</characteristic><characteristic>eyes down</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>fingers spread</characteristic><characteristic>sitting</characteristic><characteristic>knees</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Hecate (or Enitharmon) is pictured sitting on the ground with her legs drawn up and her left leg crossed in front of her right.
