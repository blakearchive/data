            The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an 
            electronic edition of Blake's ten monochrome wash drawings illustrating 
            Mary Wollstonecraft's <hi rend="i">Original Stories from Real Life</hi> and the first and 
            second editions of the book containing Blake's six engravings of his 
            designs. &#160;The designs and inscribed texts in all three series are fully 
            searchable and are supported by our Inote and ImageSizer applications.
            <lb/><lb/>
            In 1788, Joseph Johnson published the first edition of Mary 
            Wollstonecraft's morally instructive narrative for children, <hi rend="i">Original 
               Stories from Real Life; with Conversations, Calculated to Regulate the 
               Affections, and Form the Mind to Truth and Goodness</hi>. &#160;A few years later, 
            Johnson decided to issue a new edition, for which he commissioned Blake to 
            prepare a series of illustrations. &#160;Blake's extant drawings, now in the 
            Rosenwald Collection, Library of Congress, are datable to c. 1791. &#160;In 
            addition to these ten designs, Blake must have executed at least one 
            further drawing as a preliminary for his fifth plate; this drawing is 
            untraced. &#160;Six designs were selected for publication in the 1791 edition 
            of Wollstonecraft's book; Blake engraved the designs himself. &#160;The first 
            and second states of Blake's plates appear variously in copies of the 1791 
            edition.  The second edition to contain Blake's plates was published by 
            Johnson in 1796; it contains the third (final) states of Blake's plates. 
            The copy of the 1791 edition now in the Archive is from the Huntington 
            Library; it contains the second states of the plates.  The copy of the 
            1796 edition in the Archive is from the Essick collection and contains the 
            third (final) states of the plates.
            <lb/><lb/>
            Modern interpreters of the illustrations have detected a pictorial 
            critique of Wollstonecraft's stories. &#160;Blake appears to have found her 
            morality too calculating, rationalistic, and rigid. &#160;He represents 
            Wollstonecraft's spokesperson, Mrs. Mason, as a domineering presence. 
            &#160;From Blake's perspective, Mason's acts of charity are excessively 
            condescending and tend to reinforce the underlying social conditions that 
            create disparities between wealth and poverty. &#160;As Blake wrote in "The 
            Human Abstract," "Pity would be no more, / If we did not make somebody 
            Poor."
            <lb/><lb/>
            With this publication, the Archive adds a new set of scholarly tools. 
            These tools, known collectively as our Related Works system, are designed 
            to show relationships among works and individual objects in the Archive. 
            They function at two levels.  First, work index pages now include active 
            links to related materials in the Archive (for example, a set of 
            preliminary sketches for a group of engravings).  Second, the Show Me menu 
            on object view pages now includes Related Works in the Archive.  Like the work-level menu, this list includes active 
            links to the related objects and is meant to allow study of the related 
            materials side-by-side.  The Wollstonecraft illustrations are the first 
            publication in the Archive to use this feature.
            <lb/><lb/>
            As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access 
            restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible 
            by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the cooperation of 
            the international array of libraries and museums that have generously 
            given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the 
            Archive.

                  children near him.  He wears a coat, pants, shoes, and a scarf at his neck.  His left arm, and probably his right arm, are bent and rest in his lap.  His crutch lies horizontally on

                  rises up the chimney.  Two model ships sit on a mantel above the fireplace; the ship on the 
                  right has sails.  Four indistinct objects, possibly candlesticks, stand between the two ships.  Two framed pictures

                     the woman's lap; her right hand rests on top of the woman's right hand.  This girl's head is down and also rests in the woman's lap in an apparent expression of 
                     sorrow or grief. The figure on the right mirrors this position.  Her left hand rests on or holds the woman's left hand.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="D"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>father</characteristic><characteristic>Jack</characteristic><characteristic>sailor</characteristic><characteristic>sitting</characteristic><characteristic>legs bent</characteristic><characteristic>short hair</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>arms bent</characteristic><characteristic>arms on lap</characteristic><characteristic>hands together</characteristic><characteristic>scarf</characteristic><characteristic>coat</characteristic><characteristic>pants</characteristic><characteristic>shoes</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A male figure sits on the right in a chair and faces left.

Eight figures are pictured in 
                  a small room with a door, a fireplace with a grate (but no fire).   
                  We can also see the inside of the roof with two supporting beams.  On the left of the design, an adult 
                  female (Mrs. Mason) stands between two female children (Mary and Caroline).  
                  She is gowned and wears a hat.  She may be listening to the woman to the right.  She appears to 
                  be looking at the crouched figures in the lower half of the design with an expression of pity.  
                  She holds the hands of the children to her left and right.  The children  
                  are both gowned and wear hats.  The child on the left bends her left arm 
                  and holds the hand of the adult woman; the girl's right arm is down and the fingers of her right hand are 
                  slightly spread.  The child on the right is partially obscured.  She may hold hands (her right?) with the adult 
                  woman; her left arm is bent across her body.  Both children look towards the other figures in the scene with 
                  expressions suggesting pity or surprise.  Another female figure stands to the right of the doorway; she is the mother of 
                  the poor family that Mrs. Mason and her charges are visiting.  She is gowned  
                  and wears a tattered hat with a bonnet or cloth underneath.  She faces forward, but her head is turned in 
                  profile to the left.  Her mouth is open and she may be speaking to Mrs. Mason.  She holds an indistinct shape in her 
                  crossed arms; in the engraving this is more clearly an infant, seen from behind.  An adult male 
                  figure, the father, sits in a chair facing right in the lower half of the design.  He wears shoes, stockings(?), breeches, and a shirt.  
                  His hair is short and curly.  His right arm rests on his lap with his hand on his knee.  His left arm is bent 
                  and supports his head, which is bent down.  His eyes are closed, and he wears an expression of despair, melancholy, or 
                  grief.  To the right of the seated figure, a male child sits in an extremely contracted position and 
                  leans with his shoulder against the wall.  He is facing forward, with his head turned slightly to the 
                  right.  The figure appears to wear breeches.  His legs are drawn up and crossed at 
                  the ankles.  His left arm is seen at his side.  The child's eyes may be closed.  The rightmost figure in 
                  this design is a male child seated on the floor with 
                  his back against the wall.  He wears shoes, breeches, and a shirt or coat.  He faces to the left, with his legs 
                  extended together.  His left arm is at his side with his palm down.  His head is bent down, and he 
                  wears a rather blank expression.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="AC"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>Mason, Mrs.</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>hat</characteristic><characteristic>shoes</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>arms at side</characteristic><characteristic>hand holding</characteristic><characteristic>pity</characteristic><characteristic>listening</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><illusobjdesc>On the left of the design, an adult female (Mrs. Mason) stands between two female children.
