                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>In the center of the composition, two figures sit on a shoreline and look up to the left where a third figure appears above them in the upper left corner. The rightmost seated figure is male and has somewhat long, curly hair. He is nude except for a loincloth covering his genitals. He leans back and to the right with his left arm braced on the ground and slightly bent. His right arm appears to be close at his side. His right leg is bent upward with his heel resting on the ground at left, and his left leg is on the ground and bent beneath his right knee. His head is turned up to look toward the figure hovering above at left. Seated on the ground behind and slightly left of the male figure, a female figure also turns her head up to look toward the figure above. She has long hair and appears to be nude. Both arms are bent upward with hands together in front of her chest. Both legs are extended to the left and may be slightly bent. The female figure's right foot appears to be submerged in the water visible across the lower margin of the composition. The third figure emerges from the upper left side of the design, and only his upper body, which is positioned horizontally facing right, is visible. This figure has short hair and may be male(?). He appears to fly or hover in the air. He wears a long-sleeved shirt and additional drapery may be seen around his right shoulder. His right arm is raised and extended to the right with right hand above the seated pair of figures below. Washes and lines suggest clouds in the sky across the upper half of the plate. A shadowy, perhaps leafy tree is visible against the right side of the design. The ground beneath the central seated figures may be sand, and water is visible both below and behind them at left.</illusobjdesc>
