The child Jesus rides a sheep, which a young John the Baptist feeds, while Mary steadies Jesus. Jesus's hair is short curly. His body is twisted so that the lower half faces left while the upper half faces forward. He has his right arm raised horizontally and points left with his right hand. Jesus's left arm is raised at 135 degrees, holding onto Mary's arm. He sits on the sheep with legs spread. The sheep, apparently walking with the right front leg raised, faces left with its mouth open. It may be about to eat the long grass or grain that John the Baptist holds in his left hand. Mary stands to the right of Jesus, holding him steady on the sheep. She has long, curly hair, partly pulled up in a bun. Mary wears a gown and bends forward, facing left and down to look at Jesus. To the sheep's left stands John the Baptist, facing forward in a contrapposto stance. His left leg is extended behind him and is on tiptoe. John the Baptist is nude, genitals evident, and has short, curly hair. He holds grass or grain stems with tassels in his left hand and the intertwined branches of a plant or vine, with leaves or blossoms at its top, in his lowered right hand. No such scene is described in the Bible, but the subject is traditional.
