            The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of 20 of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible. These designs illustrate the Old Testament and are arranged according to the passages illustrated.  They are presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).
            <lb/><lb/>
            The Bible had an enormous influence on Blake’s work as both artist and poet.  Among his many and complex responses to that text are water color drawings.  The present group of 20 is selected from a sequence of about 80 biblical water colors of similar size Blake painted for Thomas Butts between c. 1800 and 1805.  These designs emphasize interactions between the human and the divine.  In works such as <hi rend="i">Ezekiel’s Wheels</hi> and <hi rend="i">David Delivered Out of Many Waters</hi>, the interaction is revelatory or redemptive.  In other designs, including <hi rend="i">Pestilence: The Death of the First-Born</hi>, the relationship between God and humankind devolves into punishment and destruction.
            <lb/><lb/>
            This group of 20 water colors is the first installment in our publication of a large selection of Blake’s water color drawings illustrating the Bible.  In coming months we will publish a group of New Testament illustrations also from the series executed for Butts.  Later we will add early works, such as <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>, datable to c. 1780, and continue through Blake’s final biblical water colors, including <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi> of c. 1824.
            <lb/><lb/>

In the center of the design stands God, facing forward and portrayed as an old man with long hair and a beard. God is wearing a long gown and appears to be hovering in mid-air or stepping down from a cloud. He appears to be looking down. His feet are visible beneath the hem of the gown. His arms are by his sides, but bent slightly. With his right hand, God hold Adam's right hand. With his left hand, God leads Eve by her right wrist. Eve stands facing left with her upper body twisted to face slightly forward. She is nude and has long, curly hair. Eve appears to be descending from a cloud. Her arms are at her sides, palms down. Her right leg is extended backward and on tiptoe to suggest that she is walking. She may be looking at Adam. On the left is Adam, perhaps rising from sleep or reclining supine on a giant oak leaf. His right leg is extended to the right and his left arm is bent, supporting his body weight. He raises his right arm almost vertically to be held by God's right hand. Adam is nude, with short curly hair, and is facing away but looking to the right and up at God. On the right side of the design are clouds, which Eve and perhaps God stand on. In the foreground is leafy vegetation that may provide a bed for Adam. A few leafy trees are visible in the background. On the left side of the design is a tree. Its branches are leafless; a grape vine with bunches of fruit winds around its trunk. There are leaves on the vine, which curls into a spiral once and loops once. Near the top right of the vine sits a tropical bird, facing forward. Its long tail and elaborate feathers on its head mark it as exotic. It turns its head to the right and opens its beak, as though singing. Another similar bird sits on a lower branch facing left. Behind God and Adam, sheep are grazing, facing left. In the lower right corner, four sheep graze, facing left. To the right of the sheep is a lion, facing left. Its eyes are closed, indicating that it is sleeping. Its curly mane is visible, as are its exaggerated eyelashes. A river runs in the background beneath a hill. Mountains or large hills are visible in the background. The sky appears to be cloudy.
