The figures of Abraham and Isaac dominate the design. Abraham is portrayed as an old man with long hair and a beard. He wears a gown and faces forward, but looks up slightly. In his left hand, he holds a dagger. Isaac, nude with short, curly hair, is seen from behind. He stands in front of and slightly to the left of his father, looking up at him. His right leg is extended backward and is on tiptoe. With his left arm, raised horizontally though bent slightly, he points to a ram caught in the bushes. The ram, to the left of Abraham and Issac, lies with its curled horns tangled in some leafless branches. It lies on a rock, with its head down. Surrounding the ram are a number of trees, with both leafless and leafy branches, as well as indeterminate vegetation. To the right of Abraham and Isaac is a stone altar, with a bundle of sticks and a footed bowl or goblet on top. The sky is at once cloudy and fiery, perhaps indicating a sunset or sunrise, or a divine presence.  There may be grass in the foreground below the figures.
