To the left of center stands Christ. He wears a gown and has long hair and a beard, with a suffusion of light forming a halo around his head. His right leg his bent and his right foot, on tiptoe, is visible beneath the hem of his gown. Christ faces right and bends forward slightly. His left arm is raised horizontally, palm down, perhaps in blessing. His right arm is bent and he holds the hand of the girl to his right (Jairus's daughter), helping her to rise and return to life. He also looks down and to the right at Jairus's daughter. In the center of the design is a girl draped in cloth over her legs and a veil on her head that is presumably her funeral shroud. This is Jairus's daughter; she is being raised from the dead. She has long hair and is in the process of sitting up. She faces to the left, but looks slightly forward and up at Christ. Her left leg is bent at the knee and her left foot is visible beneath the cloth. Her right arm is raised at 45 degrees but bent downward to support her in rising. Her left arm is raised horizontally and holds the right hand of Christ. Jairus's daughter lies on a bed or funeral bier, covered in drapery. There may be a pillow on this object as well. A patterned carpet covers the floor below. To the right of Jairus's daughter stand two figures, both looking at her. They both face left and down, bending forward. The leftmost figure of this pair appears to be a man with long, slightly curly hair and a long beard. He may be wearing a gown. He is likely Jairus. The rightmost figure of this pair is a woman wearing a cloak over her long gown and a veil over her long hair. Her mouth is open and her arms are at her side but bent upward, with her fingers spread. The gesture suggests surprise. She is probably the girl's mother. To the left of Christ stand three gowned figures, all facing right and slightly forward, looking down at Jairus's daughter. The leftmost figure of this trio is a male with short, curly hair and a beard. His right arm is partly visible at his side. The central figure of this group is a woman, with long, curly hair. The rightmost figure of this group is a male with a beard. The scene takes place in a darkened room, perhaps a crypt or a sickroom.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>Christ</characteristic><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>hem</characteristic><characteristic>right foot</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent at knee</characteristic><characteristic>tiptoe</characteristic><characteristic>aura</characteristic><characteristic>halo</characteristic><characteristic>radiance</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>facing down</characteristic><characteristic>bending forward</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>blessing</characteristic><characteristic>resuscitating</characteristic><characteristic>hand holding</characteristic><characteristic>palm down</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised horizontally</characteristic><characteristic>arm at side</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent</characteristic><characteristic>mouth open</characteristic><characteristic>speaking</characteristic><illusobjdesc>To the left of center in this design stands Christ.
