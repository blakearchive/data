            The William Blake Archive www.blakearchive.org is pleased to announce the publication of new electronic editions of three copies of <hi rend="i">The [First] Book of Urizen</hi>. Copies A, C, and F were beautifully and extensively color printed in the same printing session in 1794. This is the first time that Copies C and F have been reproduced, and the first reproduction of Copy A since 1929.<lb/><lb/>
            Copies A and C are in the Yale Center for British Art, Yale University, and Copy F is in the Houghton Library, Harvard University. These three copies join Copy G, from the Rosenwald Collection, Library of Congress, and together comprise half the extant copies of <hi rend="i">The [First] Book of Urizen</hi>. Two other copies of <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi>, Copy D, from the 1794 printing and Copy B from the 1795 printing, are forthcoming.<lb/><lb/>
            Blake etched in shallow relief the twenty-eight plates of <hi rend="i">The [First] Book of Urizen</hi> in 1794, although only Copies A and B contain them all. In the same year, he printed proof Copies H and I (only 3 and 2 plates respectively) and Copies A, C, D, E, F, and J. Copy B was printed the following year as part of a set of large-paper copies of the illuminated books and Copy G was printed in 1818. Plate 4 appears only in Copies A-C (an impression was pulled for Copy G but not included). The full-page designs are differently positioned in each copy; Copies A, B, E, and F also have variant orders of text plates.<lb/><lb/>
            The electronic editions have newly edited SGML-encoded texts and new images scanned and color-corrected from first-generation 4x5" transparencies; text and images are fully searchable and supported by the Inote and ImageSizer applications described in our previous updates. With the Archive's recently added comparison feature, users can easily juxtapose multiple impressions of any plate across the different copies of an illuminated book. New protocols for transcription, which produce improved accuracy and fuller documentation in editors' notes, have been applied to all the <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> texts, including previously published Copy G.<lb/><lb/>
            With the publication of these three copies, the Archive now contains fully searchable and scalable electronic editions of 48 copies of 18 of Blake's 19 illuminated books in the context of full bibliographic information about each work, careful diplomatic transcriptions of all texts, detailed descriptions of all images, and extensive bibliographies. They also join the Thomas Butts set of Blake's watercolors illustrating the Book of Job, and Blake's twelve water-color illustrations to John Milton's poems "L'Allegro" and "Il Penseroso," the first of several series of Milton illustrations that we will be adding in Preview mode. In the near future we expect to release more drawings and prints in Preview mode, which provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote, a much-anticipated electronic edition of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> Copy E, and further supplementary materials, including a biography and glossary.<lb/><lb/> 
            The editors of the Archive recently photographed 125 works by Blake in the Department of Prints and Drawings, National Gallery of Art, Washington D. C., including biblical watercolors, pencil drawings, and proofs in various states of the Job engravings. We have obtained reproductions of the Blake collections of the Fogg Museum of Art, Victoria and Albert Museum, the Metropolitan Museum, National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, and the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery. Over the next few years, we will be adding to the Archive these extensive collections of books, prints, and drawings, many of which will be reproduced in color for the first time.<lb/><lb/>
            As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible through the continuing support of the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia, by a major grant from the Preservation and Access Division of the National Endowment for the Humanities, by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and by the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.

A fully gowned old man with closed eyes and long, flowing white hair and beard, presumably 
Urizen, sits cross-legged on a large book in the center foreground.  Centered behind him is a pair of stone tablets with arched tops, like 
tombstones.  Indeterminate dark forms, perhaps another arching tree, appear above and on both sides of the tablets.  Lying on the ground to the man's left and right are two sets of quadrangular stone tablets or books or, 
alternatively, the ends of a single long tablet, perhaps a coffin lid.  The dark background, trees, and tablets 
taken together suggest a graveyard setting.  Beneath Urizen's feet is an open book.  The toes of his 
right foot emerge from his beard to mark his place in the book.  Tree roots sprout to left and right 
in the foreground beneath the book and tablets.  Holding a writing instrument in each hand and 
resting his arms on the tablets to his left and right, Urizen seems to be copying from the book onto 
the tablets.  The instruments may be quills, graphite pencils, or etching needles.

compartmented landscape of sea, land, sky, and heavens.  These sons of Urizen correspond to the 
classical elements of fire, air, earth, and water: "first Thiriel appear'd . . . Like a man from a cloud 
born, &amp; Utha / From the waters emerging . . . Grodna rent the deep earth howling . . . then Fuzon / 
Flam'd out" (Plate 24, lines 13-21).  Clockwise from the top: (1) Fire/Fuzon: A figure in flames, probably 
male, hovers horizontally, facing out toward the viewer with arms raised between the horizontal and 135 degrees.  
His position and the curved lower edge of the space he occupies suggest the sun.  (2) Air/Thiriel: 
Just below Fire, with nude body in an upward curve that reinforces the suggestion of a sun above, 
hovers a second figure, apparently male, with his hands raised to his chest and palms turned out.  Between these upper two figures and the lower two is a curving, horizontal line 
of cloud.  (3) Earth/Grodna: At lower right crouches a nude male with short hair, head up, mouth 
open, and hands on the ground.  There are slight suggestions of a short beard on his chin and left cheek.  He seems to be emerging from the earth, represented by a wave-
washed island or peninsula of land.  (4) Water/Utha: At lower left, the upward-looking head of a 
long-haired figure of uncertain sex, but apparently male, emerges from the water.

nets at the bottom of the design.  The design probably depicts the "Web dark &amp; cold" that 
"stretch'd / From the sorrows of Urizens soul / . . . / And all calld it The Net of Religion" (Plate 26, lines 17-26).</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>Urizen</characteristic><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>old</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>sitting</characteristic><characteristic>squatting</characteristic><characteristic>contracted</characteristic><characteristic>eyes down</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>arms raised horizontally</characteristic><characteristic>arms resting</characteristic><characteristic>left foot</characteristic><characteristic>halo</characteristic><characteristic>beams of light</characteristic><characteristic>knees</characteristic><illusobjdesc>An old man with full gown and long, flowing white beard and hair, presumably Urizen, sits with

light and a few beams to the right—around his head.  He is flanked by massive rope nets, one of 
which entangles his right shoulder.  His left foot peeps out (improbably, considering the 
way his legs seem to be placed) from his gown between the nets at the bottom of the 
design.
