long dress sits erect in a chair.  In her lap she holds an open

a vine.
Various small figures can be seen among the letters of the title,
including a piper wearing a broad-brimmed hat standing in the crook
of the first letter of "Innocence."  Birds
fly in the sky beneath and to the left of the "S" and above the "N"
in "SONGS."  Another bird flies upward above the first "n" of
"Innocence."</illusobjdesc>

in contrapposto, watching his 
grazing flock of sheep.  He holds a crook in his left hand; his
shepherd's purse, or wallet, is visible 
near his right knee.  In the foreground, one of the sheep looks
forward and beside it another sheep lifts its head up, as if
looking back at the shepherd.  There is a ram just to the left of
the shepherd's lower right leg.  Up the right margin beside the
shepherd is a leafy tree encircled by a vine with lily-like
blossoms near the bottom.  The tree's
longest branch extends almost to the left margin.  There are more
trees and perhaps a hilltop in the background, where the washes suggest sky at sunrise or sunset.  On the left a single
bird with broad wings and long tail feathers ascends.  Three smaller
birds soar to the right of the large bird.  Two additional birds perch on the bare section of the branch below and to the right of the three flying birds.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>A group of four adults—the text mentions "old folk"
(Object 5, line 16) and "mothers" (Object 6, line 12)—including
two(?) adults on the left, both wearing brimmed hats, and two
females wearing a scarf over her head (center) or a cap (right) sit
presumably on a circular bench at the base of the trunk of a large
oak tree.  They superintend five young children 
who stand at their knees.  Behind them five older children play and
stroll on a grassy area.  The 
dense, umbrella-shaped canopy of the central tree spreads over the
entire scene from margin to 
margin.  Other trees or bushes fill the background.  The shadows
along the lower edge of the design
suggest that the time is late afternoon or early evening ("the
darkening Green" of line 17 on the 
following object).</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Against a background colored to suggest a sunset on the "darkening Green" (line
                        17), a procession of nine adults and children (including one
                        infant) in a variety of positions moves 
                        generally leftward.  Overhead in the branches of two intertwining
                        grape vines that are rooted at lower right and grow upward along
                        the right margin and left to embrace the stanzas of
                        the poem, one boy, left, stretches on tiptoe to reach a cluster of
                        grapes on the left while a second boy, 
                        right, hands another cluster to a girl who reaches up from the
                        grass below.  Next to her, walking 
                        left, is a long-haired male in hat and tights; he holds a bunch of
                        grapes in his extended left hand.  Next in line is a woman who
                        looks down at the infant in her arms.  A small child stands just to
                        the left.  In the center, the tallest figure in the group, perhaps
                        "Old John with white hair" (line 12, Object 5), points forward with
                        his right hand.  A boy to the left, who faces away from the viewer,
                        holds a bat at his side with his left hand.  At the front of the
                        procession are a boy and girl, both looking back toward the rest of
                        the group.  Between them is a kite that the girl may be holding. 
                        The green tinting of the ground below the playful procession
                        suggests grass.</illusobjdesc>

                        selection of those on the previous object.  Christ, in conventional
                        representation as a shepherd with beard, gown, and crook, sits
                        facing left on a bank.  The sun forms a halo behind his head.  Two nude boys—the boy on the left dark of skin and his companion pink in this
                        copy—stand in front of him.  One, probably the "little English
                        boy" (line 7) whom the little black boy 
                        addresses in the final two stanzas of the poem, stands at Jesus's
                        knee, holds his hands in a praying gesture, and looks up at Jesus,
                        who looks down at him.  The other boy, probably the little black
                        boy from the previous object stands 
                        behind the little English boy with his right hand out toward him to
                        "stroke his silver hair" (line 12).  All three are sheltered under
                        a leafy, willow-like tree that forms a tight arch over their heads. 
                        A flock of sheep grazes to the left of the left-most boy.  Low hills or distant mountains appear on the horizon at left.  Although
                        colored brownish-blue in this copy, wavy lines suggest a river running at
                        the foot of the plate.  A vine rooted in the bank to the right of
                        the tree grows up the right margin.  Background tinting suggests sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc>

                        (clockwise from the far right): (1) a nude, possibly winged infant or child flying
                        or running with its arms raised vertically; (2) a winged figure,
                        probably female, in a gown, sitting on part of the plant just above
                        the "som" of "Blossom" in the title; (3) she seems to be holding an
                        infant in her arms; (4) to the left, a nude  winged figure, kneeling or sitting, facing left and probably reading a book or
                        tablet below the figure's left hand; (5 and 6) far left, two winged
                        figures who fly facing one another (one facing away from, and the
                        other facing toward, the viewer); (7 and 8) and a second pair of 
                        winged nude figures, kneeling and facing one another, embracing and
                        kissing(?).  All the figures probably represent, in some fashion,

                    <illusobjdesc>The illustration seems to depict chimney sweeper Tom
Dacre's dream of liberation for himself and his fellow sweeps by an
angel, who releases them from their "coffins of black" to 
run "naked" down a "green plain" and "wash in a river" (lines
14-18).  Against a leafy background of plants or perhaps trees are
twelve(?) small figures.  At bottom right a gowned adult bends
forward, reaching toward a nude figure emerging from the earth or
one of the coffins of the text.  Across the 
rest of the bottom of the plate are nude figures standing or
running with their arms raised in various positions.  Two pairs are
embracing. Behind the
gowned adult a tree grows up the right margin and becomes visually
linked to the interlinear decorations.  The tinting of the text area suggests a sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc>

The extension at the top of the "S" joins the vegetation in the
right margin to wrap around the right end of the title and descend
as a loopy vine in the right margin.  Other bits of vine-like
structures—some of them extensions of the marginal vegetation,
some of letters in the text—fill the spaces between quatrains of
text, while the tree and other vegetation in the right margin fill
spaces at the ends of short 
lines.  The vegetation right of lines 15-16, in which two figures
are pictured, may be a tree.</illusobjdesc>

                        grassy ground, toward the viewer.  A halo appears above the adult's head; the brim of the boy's hat also suggests a halo.  The child raises his
                        right arm.  The text describes the 
                        "little boy lost" who is "by the hand led" to safety by "God . . .

                            a boy whose hand he holds (he holds his opposite arm by his side). 
                            If this is God, it is very probably Christ, given the similarities
                            between this figure and several of Blake's other representations of
                            Christ.  Both feet are exposed; his left 
                            foot is forward.  He looks down toward the boy.</illusobjdesc>

                        "meadows," and a "table" in "the shade" (lines 3, 7, 11-12).  The 
                        suggestion of a shady refuge is reinforced by the shadows on the
                        ground, lower right.  Washes above the background vegetation suggest sky at sunrise or, more probably, sunset.</illusobjdesc>

                            left, right, and top, and fills spaces between all the stanzas.  
                            The dominant form is perhaps the vegetation with flame-like leaves
                            that swirls in the spaces of the right margin (with a more
                            conventional leaf or two at bottom right), underneath the title,
                            and down the left margin.  Tendrils extending from both margins
                            help separate the stanzas from one another.  The vine right of the
                            final stanza on the plate has several loops suggesting a spiral. 
                            The vine full of leaves and flowers(?) that extends across the top
                            of the plate above the title and fills the top right corner and the
                            space right of the first stanza is distinct from the flame-like 
                            vegetation that dominates the rest of the plate.  Extensions of
                            letters in the title contribute to both forms of vegetation: the
                            initial "A" and "C" to the vine above, the "S" to both.  In the
                            text of the poem, occasional letters have modest decorative
                            extensions, and there are a few bits of stray decorative
                            vegetation.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>A serpentine plant-like structure with
                        flame-like leaves, apparently rooted at right in the strip of
                        grassy ground that runs across the bottom of 
                        the plate, grows along the ground under the last stanza and then up
                        the left margin.  Between 
                        stanzas three and four the plant forks.  One part continues up the
                        left margin and ends under the 
                        title.  Another part of the plant curves between the third and
                        fourth stanzas and crosses into the 
                        right margin, curves back over the title and ends in an upward
                        flourish at top left.  The large plant 
                        is encircled in its upper reaches by a vine with many flowers or blossoms that is rooted,
                        like the plant itself, at the bottom 
                        right corner.  From there the vine climbs up the right margin right
                        of the standing figure and then, 
                        after arching over the figure's head, onto the flame-like plant,
                        which the vine continues to climb, finally terminating just left of
                        the title.  A second vine, much shorter, appears in front of the
                        plant at the bottom of the plate, left of the reclining figure. 
                        There are several human 
                        figures on and around the plants: (at top left) a gowned female
                        with long hair walks right; a second gowned female with long hair
                        floats behind her, pointing right; two figures kneel side by side,
                        facing right, hands raised in prayer; (at bottom right) a gowned, Christ-like
                        figure, his head surrounded by a large halo, stands with left arm extended, perhaps touching the left hand
                        of a nude(?) male figure to the left, who reclines 
                        with his right arm braced for support, his left raised vertically;
                        below and in front of this pair, a 
                        third figure, perhaps a nude female, reclines, supported on her
                        left arm.  Background washes indicate sky at sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>A slender tree with leafy branches grows up the right
                        margin, bends under and 
                        around the left end of the title—whose lettering harmonizes with
                        the surrounding foliage—and 
                        curves back over it.  A second tree, much smaller, is also rooted
                        lower right; its branches cross behind the larger tree above the
                        angel opposite "nest" in line 19.  A second branch of the larger
                        tree continues up the right side of the plate to complete the
                        circle around the title.  Several leafy branches extend left into
                        the spaces left by short lines of the poem.  The tree is loosely
                        encircled by a leafy vine whose termination, perhaps a little
                        beyond the point where the tree bends left, is unclear.  Just left
                        of the trees, lower right, a lion lies in a cave with vegetation
                        arching over it.  There are winged angelic figures in the tree, one
                        sitting with wings folded on a branch and a second hovering
                        just above the lion's den.  Two birds perch on a branch right of
                        line 6.  In the left margin are other figures and objects (bottom
                        to top): one gowned, standing on the shadowed ground and facing the
                        third stanza; just above that, another figure, gowned and facing forward and possibly winged; another, arms raised vertically, standing on a sphere (the sun or
                        moon?); just above that another, smaller, with wings and arms
                        outspread.  All the figures may be the angels described in the text
                        (Object 19, stanzas 2-3; Object 20, stanza 1).  Above the top figure
                        on the left, left of line 6, is another sphere (the sun or moon?);
                        scattered across this same space in the left margin are ten dots,
                        perhaps stars.  Dark blue and gray background washes suggest a night sky.</illusobjdesc>

                            and behind the larger tree above the angel opposite 
                            "nest" in line 19.  A second branch of the larger tree continues up
                            the right side of the plate to complete the circle around the
                            title.  Several leafy branches extend left into the spaces left by
                            short lines of the poem.  The tree is loosely encircled by a leafy
                            vine whose termination, perhaps a little beyond the point where the
                            tree bends left, is unclear.  Some indeterminate vegetation extends
                            in an arch over the cave, lower right.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>A large tree, with a leafy vine lower left, grows up
                        the left margin, while its long, leafy branches extend above and
                        behind (as it were) the text well 
                        into the right margin.  On the ground, in front of a backdrop of
                        plants, five gowned female(?) figures stand in two groups.  To the
                        right, just under the branches, one female faces left and points or
                        gestures left with her upraised left arm as
                        she turns to look at her companion, who faces forward but looks
                        left toward her companion.  To the left, close to the tree trunk,
                        stand three other females, perhaps walking.  The left-most figure
                        has her arms crossed and looks right. 
                        The one in the middle, who seems to have long hair, looks forward and perhaps down;
                        the one to the right looks left. The upper bodies of the figures in both groups are lit from behind, perhaps to suggest haloes and thus the angels mentioned in the text (Object 19, line 15; Object 20, line 8).  The light behind the two figures on the right may be the moon with dark beams of light emanating from it.  In the vine-encircled tree
                        trunk in the left margin are two other gowned female figures,
                        perhaps the angels mentioned in the text.  The lowest stands on a
                        limb of the tree and has one arm raised vertically; the top-most
                        may face forward (the position of her head is unclear in this
                        copy).  A dark shadow covers the lower edge of the grassy ground
                        and the tree trunk, lower left.  Dark blue and gray background washes suggest a night sky. </illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Below the text are three boys playing a game (of
                        marbles?) on the ground.  To the right of the boys is a bit of
                        indeterminate spiny vegetation and two large intertwining
                        grapevines extending up the right margin to the top of the 
                        plate.  On the vines are four other children: (bottom to top) one—long-haired and thus perhaps a girl—standing with arms raised, two
                        boys(?) climbing, and another boy(?) sitting and reading.  In the
                        left margin is another elaborate vine with a large bird perched
                        near its top, left of the first stanza.  A figure stands in these
                        vines, perhaps facing right, just left of the fourth
                        stanza.  Background washes suggest sky at sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc>

                        dense around the title, in the 
                        margins, and between the three stanzas.  The title area is full of
                        vegetative swirls, curls, and loops, 
                        much of it associated with the extravagant extensions of three
                        letters, the initial capitals "N" and 
                        "S" and the terminal "g."  There are also three prominent leafy
                        formations in this area: one at the top 
                        of the "S," another growing from the "N" of "Nurse's," and the
                        third in the top left corner.  Some 
                        of the loopy, vine-like decoration dangles in the left margin, and
                        a large leafy structure occupies
                        the space at the end of short line 6.  Below it is a leafy weeping
                        willow tree that leans right; its 
                        branches arch down into what may be water.  Between stanzas (after
                        lines 6, 10, and 14) and, in the right margin, at the ends of short
                        lines are other vine-like structures.  The initial letters of
                        stanzas 2, 3, and 4 have extensions that add to the decoration in
                        the left margin.  Several human figures populate 
                        the network of interlinear vegetation: two on the "N" of "Nurse's,"
                        climbing the left stroke and 
                        sitting on a leaf at the end of the curling right stroke; one
                        reaching downward through the following "u," 
                        joining hands with another who reaches up from below; one leaning
                        against the "S" of "Song" who may hold a pen or quill in his(?) right hand and write on a piece of paper in his lap; one standing(?) at the top of the "S" of "Song", facing right and reaching
                        overhead to grasp the curling vine above; two beneath "Song" on the long horizontal descender of the
                        "g"; one reclining, with right arm raised horizontally, on the bit
                        of vegetation at the end of line 4 and another(?), who merges almost indistinguishably with the vegetation,
                        in a contracted
                        posture on the leafy structure at the end of line 6.  Between the

                    <illusobjdesc>Rooted at the lower right edge of the plate in a strip of grassy ground, a
leafy, blooming plant with two major stems embraces the text of the
poem above.  The lesser stem, which culminates in a closed blossom
or unopened bud, grows in an s-curve up the right margin.  The
greater stem curves left and then up the left margin.  It 
culminates in a large and lavish blossom whose flame-like petals
open into the space above the text.  Within the blossom, in place
of stamens and pistils, are three figures.  At left, a long-haired,
gowned female sits holding an infant.  Facing right, she looks down
at it as she rests her right arm 
across it.  To the right, facing them, stands a winged and gowned
female angel who looks down at the infant and holds her hands out
toward it.  Each of her small wings is marked with a dot.  The
infant and seated mother(?) may be identified with the two speakers
of the poem; there, the infant names 
itself "Joy" (line 7).  A third stem of the plant, with no blossom
but with large leaves, grows across the bottom of the 
plate alongside the major stem; in the center-left margin yet
another stem sprouts from the main one.  Pink and yellow washes across the lower half of the design suggest sky at sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc>

                        older youths.  He may be the 
                        bard of the title.  To the left stand two young females who
                        embrace.  To the right stand the 
                        two children and a group of three gowned females who face the bard. 
                        At their feet, facing them, 
                        kneels another female.  All the figures appear to be gowned.  The
                        scene is set outdoors on a strip 
                        of slightly inclined grassy ground with a dark shadow lower right. 
                        A palm-like frond arches over

                        of the text dangles down into this major design above the heads of
                        the embracing couple.  Background washes suggest sky at sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Several varieties of vegetation fill spaces around
                        the text and between stanzas.  The initial "A" in the title sprouts
                        a plant-like structure on the left, while a loopy vine-like
                        extension dangles all the way down the left margin.  The vegetation
                        in the upper right margin—beside the "m" of "Dream" in the title—seems to be an arc of tasseled 
                        grass or grain that curves back over the title.  Beneath it—opposite stanzas 1 and 2—are three or four clusters of flame-like
                        leaves or tufts of grass.  Below those are a bit of leafy vine
                        (after line 11) and a branch or root of some sort (after line 14). 
                        In the lower right margin—opposite stanzas 4 
                        and 5—is an odd tree(?).  In front of the tree stands a figure,
                        robed, apparently wearing a hat, and holding a staff—probably the
                        "watchman of the night" (line 18), the glow-worm of the text in
                        human form.  He is one of four small human figures on the plate. 
                        The other three are in the area of the title: lying, presumably 
                        sleeping, on the left stroke of the initial "A"; sitting, perhaps
                        reading, in the "D" of "Dream"; and floating or flying, with arms
                        raised horizontally, between bits of vegetation beneath the "e" of
                        "Dream."  The animal life of the poem appears in similarly tiny
                        forms in the margins: there could be an ant (the "Emmet" of line 5)
                        or beetle to the right of line 5 and perhaps another ant crawling beneath the "her"
                        in line 10, a worm or caterpillar nestled in the lower
                        right sprigs of the vegetation right of line 6, and beetles(?) (lines 20-21)
                        flying right of lines 6 and 19.  A bird, perhaps an eagle,
                        unmentioned in the text, spreads its wings above "dream" in line
                        3.  Faint blue background washes suggest sky.</illusobjdesc>

                            "watchman of the night" (line 18), the glow-worm of the text in

                    <illusobjdesc>A lithe and leafy tree, rooted bottom right, grows up
the right edge of the plate.  A vine grows up around its trunk;
grape clusters are visible opposite stanzas 6 and 7.  At the
midway point the vine seems to produce 
the loopy tendril that terminates near the bird with long tail
feathers that ascends to the right of 
stanza 6.  Other birds fly to the right of lines 7, 13, and 24; two also perch on the branch to the right of line 6 although they tend to merge with the vegetation in this copy.  The
letters of the title are ornamented with elaborate extensions and
flourishes.  The three capital letters, along with the "h" of
"Anothers," which is decorated with a kind of forked top
above and a long flag below, and the coil following the final "w,"
are the most notable.  The left margin is dominated by a lattice of
branches from two thin trees rooted at bottom left.  
Leafless below, the branches in the upper reaches of the margin
carry the suggestion of leaves, and there are very loopy tendrils
beside the first three stanzas that may be a separate vine or part
of the tree.  A figure playing a pipe stands next to the right
tree, lower left; he may look down at an indistinguishable object (possibly a dog as in other copies) on the ground at left.  There is a second figure climbing in the
branches above, opposite stanza 7.  There may also be a third
figure with arms raised, opposite stanzas 2 and 3, although the
figure merges with the tendrils in this copy.  A fourth human form,
left of stanza 1, stands facing right with at least one arm raised and wears a gown. 
Background washes suggest sky at sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc>

margin, although only three are clearly pictured in this copy.  A
figure, facing left, stands at the base of the tree on the left and
plays a pipe.  A second figure climbs in the branches above,
opposite stanza 7.  A third, opposite stanzas 2 and 3, raises his
arms as if in supplication&#8212;although in this copy the figure is
hard to separate from the vines.  The final figure, clearly
represented left of stanza 1, stands facing right with at least one
arm raised vertically and wears a gown.</illusobjdesc>
