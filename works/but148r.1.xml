                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>This wash drawing depicts a group of seven men seated in an incomplete circle (with an empty space nearest the viewer). The man at the left end of the arc, nearest the drawing's left edge, faces right and is seen in profile. He sits in a chair with his legs bent at 90-degree angles and both feet flat on the ground. His right arm bends along the angle of his body and rests in his lap, perhaps holding the staff which rises diagonally and rests atop the man's right shoulder. The man hunches forward slightly, lowering his head and eyes as he looks down at his lap or at the ground. The man wears knee-length tights and a long coat that covers his upper body and part of the chair below him. The man has short, curly hair. The second man from left also has short, curly hair; the nature of his garment is unclear. He faces forward and to the right, sitting back somewhat from the figures on either side of him. One of his legs bends and extends into the space between the circle, his foot resting on the floor. The man's head tilts downward, and his eyes are lowered toward the ground. Lines below his head may indicate some movement of his arms or a piece of his garment. Third from left sits a man whose body faces the viewer but whose head turns to the right. He has short, curly hair, and his face is darkened, perhaps by shadows. The man wears a shirt, a cravat or other decoration near his neck, and a bulky overcoat with large lapels covering his shoulders. The man bends both arms so that his elbows protrude and his hands clasp in front of his chest. His legs are hidden by those of the figures at left. The man in the drawing's center sits, facing the viewer, with his head held up and his eyes staring forward. His mouth may open slightly. This man also has short, curly hair, and he is dressed like the other men: in knee-length pants or tights, a shirt, and a collared overcoat. His knees bend so that his feet are flat on the ground, pointing toward the viewer. His right arm bends forward as he hods a staff near his right knee. (The staff extends to the floor at a leftward diagonal.) The man's left arm is bent and lowered so that his hand rests on his left knee. At the immediate right of this figure is another man who sits, facing forward and to the left, and turns his head to look at the central man. As he does so, this man bends his left arm upward across his body and may hold an angular, indistinct object in his left hand. His face displays a look of concern. The man's hair is long and curly, and it appears to be pulled back into a low ponytail. He wears a high-collared shirt and a coat; his legs are not visible. Second from right is a less defined male figure who sits, facing left, and looks straight ahead. He appears to have curly hair, and the collar of his shirt or coat is visible at the base of his neck. Rightmost in the group is a man in knee-length pants and a shirt or coat with a collar and large cuffs. This man sits, facing left, with his legs bent and crossed at the ankles, right over left. His feet are planted on the ground in front of him. The man's left arm bends along the curve of his body, and his left hand rests in his lap. He leans forward slightly, and his head tilts downward as his eyes lower in a look of sadness. The man has short, curly hair. The men at the far left and right ends of the group sit on simple wooden chairs; the other figures are likely seated on similar pieces of furniture. The floors and walls of the room in which this group gathers appear to be bare. Shadowy areas appear in the upper corners of the drawing, at left of the center man, and behind and below the rightmost man.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>Third from left sits a man whose body faces the viewer but whose head turns to the right. He has short, curly hair, and his face is darkened, perhaps by shadows. The man wears a shirt, a cravat or other decoration near his neck, and a bulky overcoat with large lapels covering his shoulders. The man bends both arms so that his elbows protrude and his hands clasp in front of his chest. His legs are hidden by those of the figures at left.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>The man in the drawing's center sits, facing the viewer, with his head held up and his eyes staring forward. His mouth may open slightly. This man also has short, curly hair, and he is dressed like the other men: in knee-length pants or tights, a shirt, and a collared overcoat. His knees separate and bend so that his feet are flat on the ground, pointing toward the viewer. His right arm bends forward as he hods a staff near his right knee. (The staff extends to the floor at a leftward diagonal.) The man's left arm is bent and lowered so that his hand rests on his left knee.</illusobjdesc>

As he does so, this man bends his left arm upward across his body and may hold an angular, indistinct object in his left hand. His face displays a look of concern. The man's hair is long and curly, and it appears to be pulled back into a low ponytail. He wears a high-collared shirt and a coat; his legs are not visible.</illusobjdesc>

The man has short, curly hair.</illusobjdesc>
