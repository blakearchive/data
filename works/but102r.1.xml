                    <illusobjdesc>Satan, the male figure flying or hovering at right, looks left toward a group of at least fourteen figures representing the Court of Chaos who hover on clouds at left. Satan is nude except for a ribbon or drapery that descends from his right shoulder, crosses in front of his torso, and curls near his left hip. His hair is short and his mouth is open. He leans left and looks directly toward the central figures in the group at left. His right arm is raised and bent upward over his head, and he holds a shield aloft in his right hand. His left hand is raised at 45 degrees and extended to the right. In his left hand, he holds a long object that could be a pole, stick, or spear with the pointed tip outside the right margin of the design. His right leg is extended backward. Faint pentimento lines are visible below his waist and around his left shoulder. At least fourteen figures are visible hovering or sitting on clouds near the left side of the design. Two male figures in the lower left corner of the group who both have short, curly hair and beard are visible only above their torsos. Both look right and have open mouths. The lower figure holds his right arm at his side and bends his left arm upward to rest on the cloud in front of him. The figure above him turns his head up and raises his left arm horizontally to rest on the cloud in front of him or, alternatively, to hold the right knee of the figure above him at right. Above this pair of figures, four larger figures sit facing right. The leftmost of these is an old, male figure with long hair and a beard. He wears a long-sleeved shirt and bends his right arm upward near his face. He may point toward himself with his right index finger. His thighs are visible in front of him, and the figure below him may hold his right knee. To the right of this figure, a female figure with long hair and a veil or drapery over her hair sits and looks to the right although her torso is twisted forward. Her expression may be of fear or despair. Her left arm is bent and wrapped around her body, perhaps to touch the male figure at left. Her right leg is bent slightly and extended in front of her, where it disappears into the clouds. The third figure in this group from left is a male figure who sits facing forward and right. He has short curly hair and a beard. He looks directly toward Satan at right. His left arm is at his side and bent upward near his face, and he may touch the left shoulder of the female figure at left. His lower body is obscured by the clouds around him. Only the head of the fourth figure in this group from the left is visible just above the left shoulder of the third male figure. This figure appears to have short hair and closed eyes with head bent turned down slightly. The head of an additional, smaller figure is visible to the left of the leftmost large figure in this group. Only the right eye of this figure is visible facing forward and right. The heads of three smaller figures can be seen to the right of the large group of four figures. The leftmost head faces forward and left, perhaps to look back at the figures at left. The second head faces right, perhaps to look toward Satan, and has an open mouth. The third and rightmost figure in this group may face forward, though details of this figure are unclear. A group of four male figures are the uppermost figures in the Court of Chaos group. All face right and look down, perhaps toward Satan at right, with open mouths. The leftmost figure in this group has long hair and a beard. His right arm is visible near the shoulder, and his right arm may be extended forward slightly. Only the heads of the three rightmost figures are visible. The second figure from the left has short, curly hair. The details of the other two figures are not clear.</illusobjdesc>
