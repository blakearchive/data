                    <illusobjdesc>This drawing shows the ornament on the spandrels in the pediment of the canopy over the tomb of Countess Aveline in Westminster Abbey.  Swirling vegetative forms appear within an inverse triangular form with a concave upper boundary.  These forms, which appear to constitute a single branch or vine, originate in the upper left corner of the triangle. The branch extends rightward before curving down in a serpentine shape, where it divides into two branches in the middle of the triangle, with the leftmost branch curving to the left and up while the rightmost side extends further down before curving up and to the right.  Nine five-pointed leaves and fifteen bunches of berries extend from the main branch or vine.  An engraving that included this design, signed by Blake's engraving master James Basire, was published in Joseph Ayloffe, *An Account of Some Ancient Monuments in Westminster Abbey*, 1780, also published (or republished) as plate 31 in volume 2 of *Vetusta Monumenta*, published by the Society of Antiquaries c. 1789.</illusobjdesc>
