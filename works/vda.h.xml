      <seriesstmt>The William Blake Archive</seriesstmt>
      <updatestmt>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of 
        <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi>
        Copy H, in the Rosenbach Museum and Library, and the republication in full searchable mode of Blake’s sixteen engravings in John Gabriel Stedman’s 
        <hi rend="i">Narrative, of a Five Years’ Expedition, against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam</hi>
        (1796). We are presenting two versions of these plates, one with the designs uncolored and one with the designs hand colored. 
            
        <lb/>
        <lb/>
        <hi rend="i">Visions</hi>
        , extant in eighteen complete copies, consists of eleven relief-etched plates executed and first printed in 1793. Copy H was produced in Blake's first printing session and joins copies a, A, B, C, E, I, and J (1793), F (c. 1794), G (1795), and O and P (c. 1818), previously published in the Archive. Probably to lend variety to his stock of copies on hand, Blake used three ink colors in this first printing: yellow ochre (as in Copy A), raw sienna (Copies B, C, and E), and green (Copies H, I, and J). Like all early copies of 
        <hi rend="i">Visions</hi>
        , Copy H has the frontispiece printed on one side of a leaf, but all other plates are printed on both sides of five leaves. In Copy H, the embossments of the platemarks into the leaves can be seen from both sides of the leaves. Examples of the full leaves for plates 2 and 10, included as Supplemental Views in the Show Me menu, lower left under the plate images, show how the plates were registered to the leaves.

        Blake began work on the Stedman plates in 1791. Stedman visited Blake in June 1794 and subsequently the engraver helped the author with various business matters, very probably including negotiations with the book's publisher, Joseph Johnson. Blake's attitudes towards slavery and colonialism were indebted to Stedman's autobiographical narrative, as is particularly evident in the texts and designs of his illuminated books 
        <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi>
        and 
        <hi rend="i">America</hi>
        , both dated 1793. Stedman's relationship with a female slave, Joanna, may have influenced Blake's complex representations of gender and sexuality.
            
        <lb/>
        <lb/>
        With the publication of 
        <hi rend="i">Visions</hi>
        Copy H, the Archive now contains fully searchable and scalable electronic editions of 87 copies of Blake's nineteen illuminated books in the context of full bibliographic information about each work, careful diplomatic transcriptions of all texts, detailed descriptions of all images, and extensive bibliographies. New protocols for transcription, which produce improved accuracy and fuller documentation in editors' notes, have been applied to all copies of 
        <hi rend="i">Visions</hi>
        in the Archive. With the Archive's Compare feature, users can easily juxtapose multiple impressions of any plate across the different copies of this or any of the other illuminated books and, with the Virtual Lightbox, users can examine images from any genre side by side, as well as crop, zoom, and juxtapose them for close study.               
                
        <lb/>
        <lb/>
        In addition to illuminated books, the Archive contains many important manuscripts and series of engravings, sketches, and water color drawings, including illustrations to Thomas Gray's 
        <hi rend="i">Poems</hi>
        , water color and engraved illustrations to Dante's 
        <hi rend="i">Divine Comedy</hi>
        , the large color printed drawings of 1795 and c. 1805, the Linnell and Butts sets of the 
        <hi rend="i">Book of Job</hi>
        water colors and the sketchbook containing drawings for the engraved illustrations to the 
        <hi rend="i">Book of Job</hi>
        , the water color illustrations to Robert Blair's 
        <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>
        , and all nine of Blake's water color series illustrating the poetry of John Milton.
            
        <lb/>
        <lb/>
        As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees.

          <illusobjdesc>Three nude figures are seen within the mouth of a
                  cave that opens onto the sea.  Heavy clouds fill the sky, but
                  fail to cover the disc of the sun.  The shape of the area where 
                  the sun appears suggests an eye socket, perhaps within a skull 
                  outlined by the cave's mouth and in left profile.  Indeterminate 
                  vegetation dangles from the roof of the cave.  The figures sit or 
                  kneel on large stones or, in the case of the single female, perhaps 
                  on sand.  Water may intrude into the area of the cave below the
                  figures.  On the left is a heavily-muscled and bearded male seen
                  in left profile.  He sits or squats on sand or stones at the
                  cave's mouth.  He looks to the left with wide-open eyes; his face
                  is deeply marked by fear or worse; his hair stands on end.  His
                  mouth is open and he may be howling.  His knees are drawn up in a
                  contracted position; his right arm is drawn backwards as though
                  bound behind him.  Large shackles are affixed to both ankles;
                  three links of a massive chain descend below his left hip.  He
                  may be bound back-to-back with the female directly to the right.
                  This pair is probably Oothoon, the central female figure in the
                  poem, and her tormentor Bromion.  She kneels, with her body bent
                  down and to the right.  The right-most link of the chain below
                  Bromion may be attached to Oothoon.  Her face, apparently with
                  eyes closed, is pointed down; her long hair cascades over her
                  neck and down behind her head.  Above her and to the right, an
                  extremely contracted figure sits among rocks.  This is probably
                  Theotormon, Oothoon's ineffectual lover.  His legs appear to be
                  crossed, with the left foot prominently poised below his heavy
                  knees.  He faces down so that we see only the top of his head,
                  covered with curly hair.  His arms are wrapped around his head,
                  with the left arm bent at the elbow and his left hand, formed
                  into a fist, perhaps clutching his curly hair.  His right arm
                  descends along the right side of his hidden face and disappears
                  beneath his left elbow.  The design may illustrate the following
                  lines on plate 5: &quot;Bound back to back in Bromions caves terror &amp;
                  meekness dwell / At entrance Theotormon sits wearing the
                  threshold hard&quot; (line 7-8).  Given this textual parallel, the two
                  figures on the left may be personifications of terror (note the
                  expression on Bromion's face) and meekness.</illusobjdesc>

                    <p>Plate 2 is poorly registered to its leaf. It appears low and tilted to the right. The registration of leaf onto the plate was done by eye, presumably by Mrs. Blake, as she was the &quot;clean hands&quot; person operating the press and handling the paper while Blake inked the plate and brought it to the bed of the press. Such misalignments of plates, though common in the illuminated books (see also Object 10 in this copy) are frequently ignored in print and digital reproductions, either for economic or aesthetic reasons.

          <illusobjdesc>The title page is a seascape, with 
two storm-tossed waves in the lower margin, heavy clouds, rain, 
and eleven human figures.  The angle of the waves suggests a strong 
wind blowing from left to right.  A nude female runs toward us with 
her right foot touching a trough between waves, lower center.  She 
is probably the central female figure in the poem, Oothoon, who 
&quot;over the waves ... went&quot; (plate 4, line 16).  Her left leg is 
extended behind her, her arms are raised at 135 degrees, and the 
fingers of both hands are separated and extended.  She appears to 
look back and up; her long hair streams back and to the right as 
though blown by a wind.  She may be looking at the figure hovering 
in the air above her, a bearded male who looks directly at the viewer 
and may be pursuing Oothoon.  This threatening male may be Bromion,
Oothoon's tormentor in the poem; or Urizen, the evil sky-god
(among other attributes) also named in the text.  We see only his
head and face, shoulders, and arms and hands wrapped around his
shoulders in a contracted posture.  His large wings extend
horizontally.  His face is heavily lined, particularly the
forehead.  Flames spring from below his wings and rise above
them.  To the left is a ring of three female figures pictured as
though nude but with the twisted, spiraling hems of gowns
trailing behind them.  They form a circle, as though
participating in an ecstatic dance.  The figure at the bottom of
the right holds hands with her two companions.  Her arms are
extended horizontally and her legs are spread apart as though she
were striding energetically to the right.  Her head is turned away 
from the viewer.  The dancer furthest to the left also has her arms 
extended horizontally (relative to her body); her head is tilted back 
as though she were looking up.  Like her companion below, a strand of 
long hair extends from her head.  The final dancer, top right in the 
circle, has her arms raised at 135 degrees and has her legs spread.  
Her back and neck are arched backwards and she appears to be looking   
up.  Above the ring of dancers, and just left of the first diagonal 
of the letter &quot;A&quot; of &quot;Albion&quot; in line 4, is a slender, nude figure   
seen from the side with at least one arm extended downward.  She may
be holding a small scepter in her extended hand.  This figure,
probably female, seems to be descending head-first.  To the left of
this figure, near the left margin of the plate, is a nude figure, 
probably female, seen from the side and sitting on a cloud.  Her 
knees are drawn up towards her head, which is tilted down and to the 
left.  Her left arm, which we see only from the shoulder to the elbow, 
extends behind her as though it is propping her up or possibly bound 
behind her.  To the right of these two figures, and near the center of
the plate, is a figure, probably female and gowned, sitting on a cloud 
just above the letters &quot;b&quot; and &quot;i&quot; of &quot;Albion&quot; in line 4.  She faces  
to the left and we see only her left side.  Her upper body and head 
are bent over at such a sharp angle that they touch her upper left
leg.  In this contracted posture, her long hair cascades over her 
left knee.  Higher along the left margin of the design and left of
the word &quot;of&quot; in line 2 are two figures on a cloud.  Both appear to 
be nude; at least the one on the left is probably female.  We see 
this figure on the left from behind.  Her upper body is bent over,
with her left arm extending downwards (perhaps touching the head of
the figure below) and her long hair cascading downwards.  Her right 
arm is bent sharply at the elbow as though braced for support or
balance.  Her companion to the right lies on the cloud, with her
or his prominent knees on the left in a twisted and contracted
posture.  We apparently see only the top of her or his head; the
figure may be looking down.  The left arm is bent at the elbow
with the left hand beneath the head.  To the right, and right of
the word &quot;of&quot; in line 2, is a nude and possibly bearded male with 
legs crossed.  He sits on a cloud.  His hair is long; he faces 
down and to the right.  He leans to the right, with arms raised at
45 degrees (but horizontally relative to his body) and extended 
downward and to the right.  The fingers of both hands are spread and 
extended as though he were casting down the indications of rain 
lower in the design.  Slightly below and to the right of the winged 
figure, the rain appears to be cascading over cliffs that suggest 
the shapes of aged figures with shoulders hunched and heads lowered.  
A rainbow arches dramatically from lower left, through the ring of 
dancers, and ends below the figure with crossed legs upper right. 
The words of the title are integrated into the design and seem to 
float on clouds.  The motto and imprint appear to float on the sea 
below the two waves.</illusobjdesc>

        <illustration location="E" type="plate">
          <illusobjdesc>A young nude woman kneels on the ground 
and leans to the right with her arms crossed in front of her and
her hands over her breasts.  Her hair appears to be drawn back in a 
bun, yet a few strands of long hair curl down her back.  She appears
to be kissing a much smaller (apparently female) figure, although this 
&quot;kiss&quot; is less clear than in other copies because the smaller figure's 
head does not appear to be bent back.  This second nude figure is seen
from behind; her arms are extended horizontally.  Her right foot is 
poised just above one of the two flowers, probably marigolds, growing 
on a plant lower right.  Her left leg is bent at the knee in a dance-like 
posture.  She seems to hover in the air.  The kneeling figure is
probably Oothoon, the smaller figure probably the &quot;nymph&quot; who 
personifies the marigold.  As the text on plate 4 explains, &quot;Oothoon
wandered in woe, / Along the vales of Leutha seeking flowers to comfort
her; / And thus she spoke to the bright Marygold of Leutha's vale / Art 
though a flower! art thou a nymph! I see thee now a flower; / Now a 
nymph!&quot; (lines 4-8).  Given this textual point of contact, the 
landscape is Leutha's Vale, also named in the text on this plate.
The hovering nymph may also be identified with Leutha (see &quot;Leutha's 
flower,&quot; plate 3, line 6).  The small mound on which the figure kneels 
is colored as though covered with grass; a dark shadow extends on the
ground behind her. Etched shafts of radiance extend diagonally into the sky; they would seem to emanate from a sun 
just below the horizon on the right and perhaps in part from the marigold 
furthest to the right. A few short, horizontal lines suggest clouds in the sky.</illusobjdesc>

from behind.  She hovers in the air, with her right foot poised just
above a flower from which she may be rising.  Her arms are extended 
horizontally and her left knee bent forward.  This dance-like posture 
includes a gracefully twisted torso.  She appears to be kissing the 
larger figure in other copies, but this &quot;kiss&quot; is less clear in this 
copy because the smaller figure's head does not appear to be bent back.  
Given the textual parallels for the design, this small figure is probably 
the &quot;nymph&quot; who personifies the marigold flower below her (plate 4, line 
6).  She may also be identified with Leutha (see &quot;Leutha's flower,&quot; plate 3, line 6).</illusobjdesc>

          <illusobjdesc>Five figures sport in the sky surrounding 
the letters of the heading (&quot;Visions,&quot; line 1).  Top left, a nude figure,
probably female, sits on top of the first diagonal of the letter &quot;V.&quot;
She faces left, with her left knee bent and her right leg extended below
her. She holds in her left hand and to her mouth a curved horn; she is 
very probably playing this musical instrument. To the right, just above
the first &quot;i,&quot; is a billowing cloud with a long trailing edge. On it
sits a female figure, possibly wearing a gown.  She sits on the cloud 
side-saddle, as though it were a horse.  Her legs are crossed and her
head rests on her left hand—a posture traditionally associated with
melancholy.  Further to the right are two energetic male nudes.  Both
hover in the air with their legs extended and their bodies twisted.
The male above the letters &quot;o&quot; and &quot;n&quot; draws his bow, held in his right
hand with the bowstring pulled back by his left hand.  The arrow,
pointed down and to the left, has not yet been released. His companion
to the right holds his bow below him in his right hand.  Neither a
bowstring nor an arrow are pictured; perhaps he has just released the 
latter.  His left arm is bent and appears to reach behind his head;
perhaps he is reaching for another arrow (not pictured). Below the 
final letter of the heading is a hovering figure, very probably female.  
The long hem of her gown trails off to the top right in several 
snake-like curves.  She faces to the left, with at least one arm  
extended horizontally.  She may be holding something in her left hand;  
a few vertical lines indicate that some liquid is falling from her hand 
or what she holds.</illusobjdesc>

He faces down, with his right arm extended to the left and bent at 
the elbow.  His right hand is on the ground, as though to support
him.  He may be trying to rise.  His left arm, also bent at the
elbow, extends below his head.  One leg is extended to the right,
the other bent at the knee.  Given his dark coloring, he may be an 
African slave (see &quot;slaves beneath the sun,&quot; line 10).  Right of the

against the trunk of the tree.  A vine with a few ivy-like leaves 
extends horizontally to the left from the trunk of the tree near the
pickax and toward the figure.  There are indications of another vine
right of the pickax.  Background washes center and left suggest
clouds.</illusobjdesc>

upper chest in a very contracted posture.  Given the position of his
right foot, his legs are probably crossed at the ankles.  His hands 
rest upon his knees, and in turn his head is bent forward and rests
upon his hands.  We see only the top of his head, covered with curly hair.  This is probably Theotormon, &quot;weeping&quot; (plate 5, line 23) 
near &quot;the margind ocean&quot; (plate 11, line 13).  To the left is a giant 
wave, shaped like a tongue of flame.  Within this wave is a nude female, 
shackled and chained on her left ankle.  Her right leg is apparently 
extended behind her left.  She arches to the right, with her arms bent 
at the elbows and her hands clasped together just below her neck in a 
gesture that suggests prayer or supplication.  She faces down and  
apparently looks at the self-enclosed male below her.  Her long hair 
drifts behind her neck and back.  She is very probably Oothoon, pleading 
to her lover.  Right and left of the wave in which she appears is a 
rocky cliff.  Wavy lines along the lower margin of the design below 
both figures suggest small waves of the sea.</illusobjdesc>

          <illusobjdesc>A nude male sits on a cloud and holds a 
whip with three tails in his left hand.  His left upper arm is raised
vertically, with his forearm bent to the left over his head.  His
right arm is raised and arches over his head; he clutches his 
forehead with his right hand.  His left leg is extended, his right
bent at the knee.  Both his facial features and his head-clutching
gesture suggest despair.  To the right is a nude female.  She strides,
legs spread apart, forward and to the right.  Her arms are bent, with
her hands clutching her face and head.  She is facing down and we see
only the top of her head.  Her long, blonde hair trails over her
right shoulder.  She too may be supported by the cloud, although
perhaps we are meant to think of her as hovering in the air.  The
female is very probably Oothoon; the male may be Bromion, in his
character as a slave owner, about to strike the woman.  Alternatively,
he may be Theotormon as a self-flagellant.  No such scene is described 
in the text.  Large clouds dominate the sky. Beams of light extend from the cloud on the right.</illusobjdesc>

            <illusobjdesc>A nude male sits on a cloud and holds a 
whip with three tails in his left hand.  His left upper arm is raised
vertically, with his forearm bent to the left over his head.  His right
arm is raised and arches over his head; he clutches his forehead with
his right hand.  His left leg is extended, his right bent at the knee.
His body faces forward but his head is turned to the right.  His hair
is short and perhaps a little curly.  Both his facial features and his
head-clutching gesture suggest despair.  He may be Bromion, in his
character as a slave owner, about to strike the woman on the right.
Alternatively, he may be Theotormon as a self-flagellant.</illusobjdesc>

                    <p>Plate 10 is poorly registered to its leaf. It appears tilted to the right. The registration of leaf onto the plate was done by eye, presumably by Mrs. Blake, as she was the &quot;clean hands&quot; person operating the press and handling the paper while Blake inked the plate and brought it to the bed of the press. Such misalignments of plates, though common in the illuminated books (see also Object 2 in this copy) are frequently ignored in print and digital reproductions, either for economic or aesthetic reasons.

        <illustration location="AB" type="plate">
          <illusobjdesc>Four (possibly five) female figures huddle 
together in contracted postures.  The four clearly pictured wear heavy
gowns.  The figure on the right squats with knees drawn up toward her
chest; her head leans forward onto her knees and we see only the top
of her head.  Her hair is long.  The figure in the center foreground
faces to the right, with her knees drawn up and her upper body leaning
forward.  Her right knee and lower leg cover her face; we see only her
head and long hair.  Above this central figure and slightly behind are
the shoulders and face of a woman with long hair (spread out on both
sides of her head) and a desperate expression on her face.  Her hands
are raised to her shoulders with palms turned upward.  Her eyes look
up.  The final figure, on the left, is little more than a huddled gown
and the slight suggestions of hair.  Her head is on the far left, bent
low over her extended left arm.  Above this figure is an indeterminate
cluster of wavy lines that may be the hair of a fifth female figure.
These females are probably the Daughters of Albion.  The dark area in the background on the left, with a sharp upper outline like a horizon, may be the sea.  A cloud floats in the dark sky on the right.</illusobjdesc>

          <illusobjdesc>The design would appear to illustrate 
line  14: &quot;The Daughters of Albion hear her woes, &amp; eccho back her  
[Oothoon's] sighs.&quot;  Three gowned female figures—the Daughters of 
Albion—huddle together on the seashore, lower right.  The right-most 
figure in the group has her legs drawn up in a sitting or squatting 
position similar to her companions.  She looks up and to the left at 
the figure hovering above.  Her companion to the left also looks up and 
to the left.  Both of her legs are drawn up and her left foot is visible; 
given the position of her right leg, her legs may be crossed at the 
ankles.  Her right arm is extended horizontally to the right, with her 
right hand resting on her companion's left shoulder.  The left-most 
figure in the group has both legs drawn up and her head lowered; we see 
only the top of her head.  All three females have long hair.  Above the
group and to the left is Oothoon, hovering in the air or on a cloud.  We 
see only her unclothed chest, head facing forward, long hair streaming
out on both sides of her head, and long arms extended horizontally.  Her  
hands seem to rest on or hold the cloud.  Flames emanate from just below
her chest and extend over both arms.  The sea, lower left, includes some 
waves.  A large cloud extends from the lower left to the upper right of the design.</illusobjdesc>

cascades over her left shoulder.  Her left foot can be seen just below

head.  She faces forward with a serious, perhaps worried, expression.  
She may be speaking to the women below, but her mouth does not appear
to be open.  Her hands appear to rest on or hold the cloud below her.
Flames emanate from beneath her chest and curl over her arms.  This
is almost certainly Oothoon addressing the Daughters of Albion.</illusobjdesc>
