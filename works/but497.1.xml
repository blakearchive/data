    The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of thirty-three of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible.  All take their subjects from the New Testament and have been added to the twenty Old Testament subjects published in March 2010 as “Illustrations to the Bible, c. 1780-1824,” under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.  This new group is presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).
                <lb/><lb/>
                   Blake executed most of these New Testament water colors c. 1800-05 for his patron Thomas Butts.  The exceptions are <hi rend="i">The Whore of Babylon</hi> of 1809 and <hi rend="i">The Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins</hi> in the Yale Center for British Art, datable to c. 1825. The subjects range from the childhood of Jesus to his ascension, the later history of his parents and one of his major followers, St. Paul, and a group of eight designs based on the Book of Revelation.  While the illustrations of the life of Christ are fairly conventional in their subjects, in part because of the long tradition of picturing almost every event in the Gospels, individual motifs recall designs in Blake’s illuminated books and thus offer a window on Blake’s visual interpretation of the Bible. The illustrations of Revelation complement Blake’s intense engagement with apocalyptic events and images in his own poetry.
                    <lb/><lb/>
                        The selection of fifty-three biblical water colors now available in the Archive will be supplemented in the future with early works, such as <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>, datable to c. 1780, and will continue through Blake’s final biblical water colors, such as <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi>. 
                    <lb/><lb/>

In the center hangs Jesus on a cross, with nails through each hand and his feet and hints of blood around those nails. He faces forward and looks down, wearing only a loincloth and a crown of thorns. His arms are raised horizontally and his feet are touching. He has long, slightly curly hair and a beard. Jesus also emanates a halo-like aura around his head. Jesus hangs on a wooden cross with the letters "INRI" on the top. To the left of the cross stand at least eight gowned figures. Only the top of the head, facing right, is visible of the leftmost figure. Only the head, facing right and slightly down, is visible of the second-to-left figure, which is probably female, given the veil covering her hair. The third-to-left figure is that of a female with long, curly hair. She faces right and has her head down. Her right leg is bent slightly and her arms are bent upward, with her hands on her face. She leans on the shoulder of the figure to the right and may be crying. The fourth-to-left figure is that of a female with long, curly hair, facing away and to the left. Her head is slightly down and her left arm is bent. Her left leg is bent slightly and extended backward slightly. The fourth-to-right figure is visible only has a head, perhaps with long hair and a head veil, looking right. The third-to-right figure is a female facing right and looking up to Christ. Her right leg is bent and extended backward slightly. She wears a veil over her long hair, which is slightly curly. Her arms are bent upward, palms together as though in prayer or supplication. She is probably the Virgin Mary, given the slight aura that emanates from her. The second-to-right figure is that of a female with long, perhaps curly, hair and a head veil, facing right and down. The rightmost figure is that of a female with long, curly hair, facing right and down. Her arms are bent upward and her hands are on her face. She may be crying. This may be either Mary, the wife of Cleophas, or Mary Magdalene (see John 19:25). To the right of the cross stand at least eight gowned figures. The leftmost figure is that of a female with long hair, facing left, down, and slightly away. Her right arm is at her side, but may be bent. She may be crying as she leans against the cross. This is may be either Mary, the wife of Cleophas, or Mary Magdalene. Only the top of the head of the second-to-left figure is visible, facing left. The third-to-left figure faces forward and slightly left, looking up at Jesus. He has short, curly hair and crosses his arms. He appears to be crying. This is the "disciple" addressed by Christ (John 19:27) and is probably represented here as John the apostle. The fourth-to-left figure is only visible as the top of a head, facing left and down. The third-to-right figure may be a male with short, curly hair, facing left and down. His face is covered, and he may be crying. The second-to-right figure faces right and down slightly. Its gender is indeterminable, but it has curly hair, and holds its arms bent upward with its hands on its face. The figure may be crying. The rightmost figure is a male, partly bald, who faces right and down. The sky is dark and cloudy, indicating that day has turned to night at the Crucifixion on the mount of Calvary. Streaks of light in the sky suggest lightning. A slight pink wash in the sky near the cross may indicate sunrise or sunset. The figures stand on a patch of bare earth.
