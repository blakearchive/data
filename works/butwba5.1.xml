            <illusobjdesc>Two young male figures float or hover and six older male figures surround them. The two central male figures extend their bodies diagonally, facing right with their legs extended backward and their arms extended forward, reaching toward the figures to their right. They both have dark curly hair and beards. The figure in the front is nude, and the figure behind him wears a long gown. Behind the central pair, a group of three old, male figures stand and wear long gowns. The figure in front of the group has long white hair and a long beard, and his front bare feet appear at the bottom of his gown as if stepping forward. He mostly obscures the two male figures behind him, but they appear to be bald and may have beards. They all face forward to look at the central figures. To the right, a group of three men stand or hover while looking at the two central figures. The figure in front of this group has long hair and hovers with his back to the viewer and facing left. His left hand is raised slightly with his fingers spread and palm up. He mostly obscures the figure behind him, a male with curly hair. A man with long hair and beard stands or hovers at the back of the group with his right arm at his side. The background is indistinct, but there appears to be clouds in the left half of the design.</illusobjdesc>
