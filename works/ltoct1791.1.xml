                <compdate value="1791.B">1791<note>Willey Reveley's letter to Blake is dated "Oct
                        18" in Reveley's hand, but the partial postmark stamp, "C OCT / 7", suggests
                        it may have actually been posted by [1]7 October 1791. Bentley (*Writings* volume 2, page 1521) notes "The date of the letter is in
                        some doubt [...] for though Reveley clearly dated the letter 'Oct 18', the
                        numeral in the postmark is equally clearly a '7'. I cannot reconcile these
                        facts." Blake's undated reply to Reveley was written on the back of the
                        letter he received by post from Reveley. According to Essick (*Huntington*, page 185), "Blake refers to his willingness to engrave
                        for Reveley 'by the end of January' some illustrations for James Stuart and
                        Nicholas Revett, *The Antiquities of Athens*. Volume 3
                        (1794) of that work (see Part III, section B, No. 48) includes 4 plates by
                        Blake dated 3 April 1792 in the imprints. Thus, Blake must have written his
                        note, a direct reply to Reveley's letter, shortly after 18 October 1791."
