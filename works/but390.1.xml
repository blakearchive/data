A nude female figure with long, curly hair, evidently Bathsheba, stands at the center of the design. She faces forward, with one leg extended backward and on tiptoe. Bathsheba looks down to her left and has both arms raised at 45 degrees, one behind each of the children that flank her. Her right hand touches the back or shoulder of the child to the left. To Bathsheba's left is a nude child facing away but looking up and to the right at Bathsheba. The left leg is extended backward and is on tiptoe. The child's gender is not clearly indicated. To the right of Bathsheba's is a nude girl with long hair. She faces forward, but looks slightly left. Her right leg is extended slightly backward and is on tiptoe. She may be partly clothed by a long gown or drapery that rests on her shoulders and fall below her right hand, which may be holding the cloth.  In her left hand she holds by a handle a triangular vessel of some sort. To the left sits a nude woman, with her feet in the water of the bath. She has long curly hair and rests her right arm on her right knee; her left arm is raised and she may hold an object, possibly a washing cloth, in her left hand. Her right hand rests on the top of a covered vase or vessel of some sort. She faces forward and left, looking up at the three standing figures. The four nude figures are standing or sitting on some rocks(?) by the edge of a pond or bath. There are carved wooden(?) columns to the right and the left of the bathing area. The columns on the left have leafy vines growing up them. To the right of the girl grow a number of flowering plants. In the background grow some trees or leafy but indeterminate vegetation. In the upper right corner of the design, King David stands "on the roof of the king's house" (2 Samuel 11:2). He is dressed in a gown and cloak, and wears a crown on his head. His body is facing partly to the right, but his head is turned left to look at the bathers. His arms are raised in front of him horizontally, his right extended over his chest. His left palm is raised and turned out toward the viewer.  His gestures suggest surprise. The sky backing this scene is cloudy with a sunrise or sunset.
