This is a night scene, further darkened by pigment decay over the years. At the center of the Virgin Mary rides side-saddle on a donkey. The animal faces left and has its head down and its front, front left leg raised. Mary sits, facing forward, wearing a gown and a veil covering her hair. She has a halo above her head. Her knees are bent, as are her arms. A crescent moon appears above and to the left of the Virgin's head. She holds the infant Jesus on her lap. Jesus sits on Mary's lap, with his head facing forward and his body facing left. He appears to be gowned or swaddled. He may have a halo, or may just be lit with an aura. Around Mary's head hover or fly six nude putti (cherubs or infant wingless angels). On the left, the topmost is seen from behind with its arms raised horizontally and its legs extended backward slightly, left leg bent. The middle putto on the left has its arms folded over its chest and both legs bent. The lowermost putto on the left looks back, mouth open, at Mary; it may have long hair or a veil over its head. The topmost putto on the right looks to the right and has its right arm raised at 135 degrees, perhaps pointing with its right hand up and to the left. Its right leg and left arm are bent, but its left leg is extended backward. The middle putto on the right may have its legs extended backward and its arms folded over its chest. The lowermost putto on the right has its knees and arms bent, and may hold its left hand to its mouth or both hands together in prayer. To the right of the donkey hovers or flies a winged male angel with short hair. He is seen from behind with his head turned in right profile. He appears to be gowned; his right foot is pictured. The head of another angel, looking forward and right, appears to the left of the frontmost angel. To the left of the donkey stand two figures, both gowned and facing forward, but turning their heads to the right to look at Mary. The figure to the right has a beard and is probably Joseph. His right arm appears to be bent upward under his garment; his left arm may be down and bent slightly across his body. The figure on the left is probably an angel whose large wings back both figures.  His right arm is at his side.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>dark</characteristic><characteristic>darkness</characteristic><characteristic>night</characteristic><illusobjdesc>This is a night scene, further darkened by pigment decay over the years.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="A"><characteristic>moon</characteristic><characteristic>crescent</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A crescent moon appears above and to the left of the Virgin Mary's head.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="animal" location="E"><characteristic>ass</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>head down</characteristic><characteristic>walking</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent</characteristic><characteristic>hoof</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The Virgin Mary rides an ass or donkey.
