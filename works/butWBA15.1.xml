                    <p>The attribution of this drawing to Blake is far from certain.  Blake's engraving master, James Basire, was commissioned to provide illustrations for Richard Gough, *Sepulchral Monuments, in Great Britain*, 1786. Blake was assigned the task of drawing pictures of the tomb monuments in Westminster Abbey. In addition to this drawing of the tomb effigy of Edward the Third, Blake executed three other drawings of his tomb, Butlin 41-43.  Unlike those three, this drawing was not engraved and published in Gough's book. The inscription in the lower margin ("KING EDWARD III. | From his Tomb in Westminster Abbey") may not be by Blake even if one accepts the attribution of the drawing to him.  The collection stamp of Westminster Libraries appears top left.  This drawing was unknown until its discovery in 1987; see Martin Butlin, "A New Blake from his Apprentice Years?," *Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly*, 21.4 (spring 1988): 143.</p></objnote>

                    <illusobjdesc>This wash drawing depicts the upper torso and head of a statue, identified as the effigy of King Edward III from his tomb in Westminster Abbey. He has long, wavy hair and a long beard that reaches his chest. His face is depicted prominently in the center of the drawing facing outward, directly toward the viewer. Although his eyes are open, the eye sockets are empty, suggesting that the drawing is of a lifeless statue rather than a living man. His forehead and brow are creased and his lips are pursed. A cloak or cape with a brocade or patterned edge is wrapped around his rounded shoulders. He wears a tunic or shirt decorated with a wide band across his chest. A heavy, dark rectangular frame encloses the drawing. </illusobjdesc>
