<updatestmt> 
The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of a digital edition of forty-seven monochrome wash drawings created by Blake between c. 1774 and c. 1786.  
<lb/>
<lb/>
The use of monochrome washes to tint a pencil or pen and ink drawing offered eighteenth-century artists several advantages. They could register gradations in tone, from the white of the untouched paper to jet black, without the more time-consuming use of actual colors. No further work was required if the wash drawing was intended as a preliminary for an uncolored engraving. A monochrome wash could also be used to underlie subsequent applications of water colors, thereby darkening selected areas to create the illusion of depth or cast motifs in shadow.  
<lb/>
<lb/>
As the works presented here show, Blake made full use of monochrome washes from his earliest years as an artist. When assigned by his engraving master, James Basire, to record tombs in Westminster Abbey c. 1774-75, Blake applied black and gray washes to tint many of his drawings (Objects 1-5). These carefully executed works could then be used as preliminaries for subsequent engravings by Basire’s workshop.
<lb/>
<lb/>
Blake’s monochrome washes during his first decade as an independent artist and engraver include several interrelated groups. The seven drawings of figures from Michelangelo’s Sistine ceiling (Objects 37-43) demonstrate how copying engravings of works by Renaissance masters helped Blake learn postures and gestures he would later use in his own compositions. Other drawings provide visual evidence of how Blake developed a design from early sketches to highly finished water colors or engravings. The recto/verso drawings, <hi rend="i">Two Sketches for “Joseph Making Himself Known to His Brethren”</hi> (Objects 34 and 35), are preliminaries for the finished water color in the Fitzwilliam Museum, one of three illustrations of the biblical story of Joseph that are among Blake’s finest pictorial works of the 1780s. The three Joseph water colors are in the Archive along with a water color preliminary for <hi rend="i">Joseph Ordering Simeon to be Bound</hi>. The evolution of one of Blake’s earliest original book illustrations, a frontispiece for Thomas Commins’ <hi rend="i">Elegy Set to Music</hi> of 1786, can be traced through three variant wash drawings (Objects 45-47) and a pencil sketch also in the Archive. The four wash versions of <hi rend="i">The Good Farmer</hi> reproduced here (Objects 16-19), in addition to two pen and ink drawings of the subject previously added to the Archive, show the complex ways Blake played variations on a theme as he worked toward a final version. No such finished work is known, and thus these drawings are our only record of Blake’s engagement with this subject. Similarly, for <hi rend="i">War Unchained by an Angel, Fire, Pestilence, and Famine Following</hi>, an untraced work Blake exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1784, we have only a preliminary study (Object 6).
<lb/>
<lb/>
Blake’s illustrations to his poem <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> of c. 1789 are among his most accomplished monochrome wash drawings. These have been published in the Archive as an independent group coordinated with the <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> manuscript.

                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>Beneath a leafy tree, a standing female figure, at left, looks toward a male figure at right who raises his right arm to touch a horse(?) standing between the figures. The female figure has long, curly hair and wears a long veil that wraps around her right elbow. She wears either a gown or a shirt and skirt; her garment's collar is ruffled. A belt or perhaps the strap of a bag, which may be visible near her right hip, is visible around her waist. She faces right and her eyes may be closed. Both arms are at her sides and bent slightly upward with palms facing up and fingers spread. Her right leg is bent beneath her gown or skirt, which suggests she may walk to the right or stand in a contrapposto position. The male figure at right stands facing left and looks toward the female figure. He has short hair and a beard, and he appears to wear a knee-length gown or tunic. His right arm is raised horizontally and he may touch or point to the shadowy figure or animal at left. His left arm is at his side and bent upwards to hold a walking stick. His right leg is bent suggesting a contrapposto stance. Several spiky lines above his left shoulder may suggest a quiver of arrows as well as a darker, rounded form representing one end of a bow. The form in between the two figures may be a horse, as suggested by the oval shape of its head and lines that suggest a mane. However, the form is covered with dark washes that obscure most details. One front leg is suggested at left of the male standing figure and one back leg may be visible behind and right of the male figure. A tree with a thick trunk that leans to the right and dense, leafy canopy stands over the figures in the foreground. Additional vegetation, perhaps bushes or tall grass, are visible around the base of the tree in the lower left corner, behind the female figure. Vertical lines near the left margin suggest at least two additional trees in the background. Shadowy washes near the right margin may suggest clouds in the background sky or additional vegetation.  The two figures might be Robin Hood (right) and Clorinda (left), as in Blake's engraving of 1783 after J. Meheux, <hi rend="i">Robin Hood and Clorinda</hi>.</illusobjdesc>

Several spiky lines above his left shoulder may suggest a quiver of arrows as well as a darker, rounded form representing one end of a bow.  He might be Robin Hood, as in Blake's engraving of 1783 after J. Meheux, <hi rend="i">Robin Hood and Clorinda</hi>.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>The form in between the two figures may be a horse, as suggested by the oval shape of its head and lines that suggest a mane. However, the form is covered with shadowy, dark washes that obscure most details. One front leg is suggested at left of the male standing figure and one back leg may be visible behind and right of the male figure.</illusobjdesc>

Additional vegetation, perhaps bushes or tall grass, are visible around the base of the tree in the lower left corner, behind the female figure. Vertical lines near the left margin suggest at least two additional trees in the background.</illusobjdesc>
