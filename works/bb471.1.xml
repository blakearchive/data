                The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of electronic editions of Blake's illustrations to works by William Hayley, including his <hi rend="i">Essay on Sculpture</hi>, the broadside ballad <hi rend="i">Little Tom the Sailor</hi>, <hi rend="i">The Triumphs of Temper</hi>, <hi rend="i">The Life and Posthumous Writings of William Cowper</hi>, and <hi rend="i">The Life of George Romney</hi>. We are also republishing Blake’s etched and engraved illustrations to <hi rend="i">Designs to a Series of Ballads, Written by William Hayley</hi> (1802) and Hayley’s <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi> (1805). The designs and engraved texts of both sets of <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi>&#160;illustrations, as well as the new material now being published, are fully searchable.<lb/><lb/>
                In late 1799, William Hayley was seeking an engraver to illustrate his poem <hi rend="i">Essay on Sculpture</hi>. Possibly on the advice of the sculptor John Flaxman, Hayley commissioned Blake to produce three plates. In July 1800, Blake spent much of July working on the final plate, an engraving of Hayley’s deceased son, Thomas, in Hayley’s library in the coastal village of Felpham, West Sussex. During these weeks, Hayley persuaded Blake to relocate from London to Felpham to work on a number of graphic projects.  Disenchanted with his failure to secure commercial engraving work in London, Blake enthusiastically took up Hayley’s offer.<lb/><lb/>                                                
                The works now published and republished include all of Blake’s commercial engravings executed for Hayley during the three-year period Blake and his wife Catherine spent in Felpham. In addition, the Blake Archive is publishing two more engravings Blake worked on for Hayley after the Blakes had returned to London in September 1803. These plates were commissioned to illustrate Hayley’s <hi rend="i">The Life of George Romney</hi> (1809). Only one of these plates, <hi rend="i">Sketch of a Shipwreck after Romney</hi>, was included in the published biography. The other, a portrait engraving of Romney, was rejected and, until very recently, has not been seen since the 1939 Blake exhibition in Philadelphia. <lb/><lb/>

In the center of the design are two figures beneath a leafy tree. The rightmost figure is a clothed and seated male, seen from behind and facing left. This is Sir Gilbert, the father of the main protagonist in Hayley's poem, Serena. Sir Gilbert is wearing a long coat with a collar, his face is in profile, facing left, and he has long, swept back hair. His left arm is bent at the elbow and his left hand is holding his collar. Sir Gilbert's left eye is open and he may be reading the open book in front of him (the book is presumably held in Sir Gilbert's right hand although this is not visible). Sir Gilbert's legs and feet are visible. He is wearing shoes and stockings; his left shoe is on tiptoe and the visible part of his right shoe is on the ground. He is sitting in a wooden chair, described as an "elbow chair" in Hayley's poem. The leftmost figure is a female with long hair. This is Serena; she faces right, her head in profile. Her right eye is open and she is looking at the book her father is holding. Serena is wearing a long white gown and is holding a wicker basket with a handle that contains leaves and either flowers, vegetables, or fruit. Her right arm is bent at 90 degrees and her right hand holds the bottom of the basket. Her left hand is placed on top of the basket's handle. Below the hem of Serena's gown her shoes are visible. The shoes are on tiptoe, indicating that Serena is walking toward her father. The scene takes place in Sir Gilbert's garden. On the right of the design is a tree trunk, with leafy vegetation at its base. Creeping vines are visible on the lower portion of the tree trunk. In the top right corner of the design, the tree separates into several leafy branches that extend to the left. In the left foreground is a flowering lily-like plant, with two blooming flowers and two buds. In the center foreground is a pathway that Serena is walking on as she approaches her father. In the background there is more vegetation, including bushes and trees. The scene takes places during the daytime and the sky appears to be partially cloudy.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="BD"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>Sir Gilbert</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>eyes down</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>reading</characteristic><characteristic>sitting</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>legs bent</characteristic><characteristic>tiptoe</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>touching</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>coat</characteristic><characteristic>stockings</characteristic><characteristic>shoe</characteristic><illusobjdesc>In the center of the design are two figures beneath a leafy tree.

Her right arm is bent at 90 degrees; the upper part of her arm rests on a pillow atop a table and her right hand is clasping the fingers of her left hand, held in front of her face in prayer. According to Hayley's text, Serena is praying to "her guardian Sprite." Serena is wearing a semi-transparent gown and her hair is drawn up and tied back with a band or headscarf. She is looking upward and her mouth is open. On the left of the design is the side of a bed with the curtains drawn back. To the right of the bed is a chair with a wicker(?) back and seat. On the right of the design is a lampstand with a burning oil lamp issuing flames and possibly smoke. Behind the oil lamp and its stand is a table covered with a table cloth that extends to the patterned carpet. The hem of the table cloth is also patterned. On top of the table is an oval mirror set within a decorative stand that incorporates an oval decoration below the mirror. The mirror is reflecting the oil lamp, the shadow of which falls across the table. Behind the table and mirror are half-drawn curtains. To the left of these curtains and above the chair is an area of wall.

A female figure occupies the center of the design. This is Serena, her body facing away and to the left with her head turned to the right. Serena has long hair pulled into a bun and secured with a band or scarf. She is wearing a semi-transparent gown. Her left arm is bent and her hands are placed together in front of her, in prayer or supplication. Serena's left leg is bent at the knee and her left shoe is visible beneath the hem of her gown. The shoe is on tiptoe indicating that she is walking toward the entrance of the cave-like dome of spleen. A stone arch, described in Hayley's poem as a "wide fantastic arch," forms the entrance to the dome of spleen. At the apex of the arch and aligned centrally above Serena's head is a sign or plaque containing undecipherable letters. Beyond the arch, there are five figures and a creature with bat-like wings. These figures represent the "unnumber'd phantoms" from Hayley's poem and are surrounded by flames or smoke. They are grouped on the left side of the interior of the arch and are vertically aligned. The lower figure is male, nude from the waist upward, with a prominent forehead and short hair. His body faces away, with his left arm raised horizontally while his head is turned back and faces right. His eyes are open and he is looking in the direction of Serena. His mouth is open and issues forth a stream of vapour or smoke. His lower body is covered in scales and his legs are serpent coils. The figure above is male with hair centrally parted. He may be nude. His head faces forward and he is looking in the direction of Serena. His body faces right and his left leg extends backward, indicating that he is walking to the right. The figure above and to the left is male and nude. He has short hair and his head faces right, in the direction of Serena. His body faces left and his genitals are visible. His right leg is bent and his right foot is on tiptoe. His left leg is straight, suggesting that his is walking to the left. His left arm is raised horizontally and bent at 90 degrees, and rests on the shoulder of the male figure below and to the right. Behind these figures is another male(?) figure. Only the head and shoulders are visible. He faces forward and to the right; he has curly hair and is looking in the direction of Serena. Above this group is a bird with bat-like wings, a long, open beak and a long serpentine tail. The bird's head faces right in profile and its wings are spread. Above this creature is a soaring male(?) figure with long hair. He faces forward and to the right, in the direction of Serena. His left arm is raised at 135 degrees and his right arm is by his side. The lower part of the design comprises a stone floor. Light from the flames inside the dome of spleen illuminates the section of floor that Serena is walking on.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>Serena</characteristic><characteristic>walking</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>head up</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>bun</characteristic><characteristic>band</characteristic><characteristic>transparent</characteristic><characteristic>scarf</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>shoe</characteristic><characteristic>facing away</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent</characteristic><characteristic>hand holding</characteristic><characteristic>praying</characteristic><characteristic>supplicating</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A female figure occupies the center of the design.

Three figures occupy the center of the design. The figure on the right is Serena, with long hair. She is sitting and wearing a gown. Her upper body faces forward while her legs, which are bent, face left. Serena's eyes are open and she is looking down at, and reading from, the open pages of a book. Her left arm is bent and rests on the back of a chair. Her right arm is slightly bent and in her right hand she holds the open book. The central figure is a seated female, facing forward with her head facing left in the direction of Serena. This is Serena's aunt, Penelope. Her eyes are open and she is looking at Serena. Her downturned mouth suggests displeasure or anger. Her hair is drawn up under a scarf or tight-fitting hat and tied with a bow. She is wearing a gown with a large collar. The seated figure on the left is male. This is Serena's father, Sir Gilbert. He faces right, in profile, and has long hair tied in a pony tail. His legs and arms are bent and he is holding a newspaper in both hands. His eyes are open and he appears to be looking at either the newspaper or Serena. His expression suggests anger. He is wearing a long coat, stockings and shoes. Sir Gilbert sits in a large chair. Between these figures is a round table covered with a table cloth. On top of the table are two tea cups and their saucers and a teapot. On the right of the design is a wooden chair with a wicker(?) seat. Hanging over the back of the chair is a robe, large piece of cloth, or a lap rug. On the left of the design in a large window set in a casement and adorned with sash curtains. In the background of the room, behind the seated figures and right of the window, are two walls with a decorative panel (perhaps a shutter) and moulding just below the ceiling.
