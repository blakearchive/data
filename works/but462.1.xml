            The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of 20 of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible. These designs illustrate the Old Testament and are arranged according to the passages illustrated.  They are presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).
            <lb/><lb/>
            The Bible had an enormous influence on Blake’s work as both artist and poet.  Among his many and complex responses to that text are water color drawings.  The present group of 20 is selected from a sequence of about 80 biblical water colors of similar size Blake painted for Thomas Butts between c. 1800 and 1805.  These designs emphasize interactions between the human and the divine.  In works such as <hi rend="i">Ezekiel’s Wheels</hi> and <hi rend="i">David Delivered Out of Many Waters</hi>, the interaction is revelatory or redemptive.  In other designs, including <hi rend="i">Pestilence: The Death of the First-Born</hi>, the relationship between God and humankind devolves into punishment and destruction.
            <lb/><lb/>
            This group of 20 water colors is the first installment in our publication of a large selection of Blake’s water color drawings illustrating the Bible.  In coming months we will publish a group of New Testament illustrations also from the series executed for Butts.  Later we will add early works, such as <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>, datable to c. 1780, and continue through Blake’s final biblical water colors, including <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi> of c. 1824.
            <lb/><lb/>

On the bottom center of the design floats the head, shoulders, and arms of David. He has long hair and a beard and faces away and up with his head bent back sharply. His arms are raised horizontally in a suggestion of a cruciform position and wrapped around with rope. On the top center of the design, Christ, a gowned male, hovers in mid-air, facing forward, but bending down, perhaps to look at David. His left leg is bent backward and his arms raised horizontally, palms down, in a cruciform posture. He has long hair and a beard; an aura of light emanates from him which suggests a halo above his head. Surrounding Christ are seven male winged angels, the cherubim, all facing forward and with their mouths open as though singing. Three are to the left of Christ's, one by his feet, and three to the right, though forearms and hands that extend in from the margins in the frontmost row of angels suggest that there are more angels not otherwise portrayed. The frontmost angel to the left ofJesus has short, curly hair and a beard. His arms are raised at 135 degrees, palms up. The middle angel of this group has long, spiky hair and a beard, and appears to be old. The rearmost angel has short, curly hair and appears to be young. The angel by Jesus's feet has long, curly hair and raises his arms at 135 degrees, palms up. The frontmost angel to the right of Jesus has curly hair and a beard. He raises his arms at 135 degrees, palms up. The middle angel of this group has long, spiky hair and a beard, and appears to be old. The rearmost angel has short, curly hair and appears to be young. The waters at the bottom of the design are dark and choppy, with small waves visible. There may be blots of lightning just above David.
