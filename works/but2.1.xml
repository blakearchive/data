                    <illusobjdesc>The composition depicts two detailed drawings of King Edward I in his coffin. Both coffins are unlidded and the king's body lies horizontally with head at left facing upward. In the coffin at left, Edward's entire body is shrouded although his crown and the bird atop his staff are still visible. In the depiction at right, his torso and face are uncovered and the open shroud drapes over the sides of the coffin. The king is bald and his eyes are closed. He wears a crown with three trefoils, a cape or drapery clasped at his right shoulder with a decorative pin, a long-sleeved shirt, and two decorative sashes that cross in front of his torso. His arms are at his sides and in each he holds a staff. His lower body remains covered in drapery. Four details of Edward's costume are included below the coffins and include, from left, a staff topped with a bird above three leafy decorations, a staff topped with a cross, a detail of the diamond-shaped decorations on the two sashes crossing the king's shirt, and the decorated clasp or pin from his right shoulder. A scale of seven feet is included along the lower edge of the composition.</illusobjdesc>
