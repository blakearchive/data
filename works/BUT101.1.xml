                    <illusobjdesc>Satan, the nude male figure at left, lunges or runs with arms raised toward the two figures at right, the nude female figure Sin and the crowned male figure Death. Satan and Death appear prepared to spear one another while Sin attempts to intervene. Satan has short hair and his mouth is open. He holds a spear in his right hand and a shield in his left. Facing right, he looks toward the pair of figures at right as he steps toward them with his extended right leg. The female figure Sin stands near the right side of the design and faces left to look toward Satan. She has long curly hair and is nude, at least above the waist. She raises both arms, which are slightly bent, and extends them left toward Satan. Her mouth is open. Her right leg appears to be raised and bent, as if she is stepping to the left. Her lower body is partially obscured by the heads of three dogs, most likely representing the three-headed Cerberus, who faces left with three open mouths. The details of the lower right corner are unclear, though Cerberus may be in a low boat atop an area of water(?). The third figure Death, who is nude, stands behind and to the left of Sin facing left as he walks or lunges to the left. He wears a spiky crown and has a beard. His mouth is open and his eyes are turned down and to the left. He may look toward Satan. Both arms are raised over his head where he holds a spear with at least his right hand. Shadows appear on Death's right leg and left arm as well as in the upper right corner behind him. Also in the upper right corner, several vertical lines, suggesting an indistinct architectural form such as a pillar, are visible. Flames are visible in the lower left corner of the design behind Satan.</illusobjdesc>
