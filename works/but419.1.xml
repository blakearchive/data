In the center of the design sits Jesus on a stone or wooden chair placed in front of a tree trunk. The tree's leafy branches extend along the length of the top of the design. Jesus sits, facing forward, with his arms crossed. He has long hair and a beard and is wearing a gown. A slight radiance around his head suggests a halo. In each arm, Jesus holds a small child. In front of Jesus, in between his legs, stands a nude child (probably male) with short, curly hair, facing away. The child's left leg is extended behind him and is on tiptoe. To the left of Jesus's chair stands a female child, gowned and with long hair. She leans her elbows on the arm of the chair, and faces right; she looks up and holds her hands together as if praying. To the right of Jesus's chair stands a male(?) child. He wears a gown and leans slightly left, facing forward. His legs are crossed and his hands are raised in prayer. To the left of Jesus stand two adults. The leftmost figure is an old man with a beard. He faces right and has his right arm bent upward, with a finger raised as if pointing. The rightmost figure appears to be a gowned female with her hair pulled up into a bun. She stands in contrapposto, with her left leg extended backward slightly and on tiptoe. In her right arm, bent upward, she holds a nude(?) infant. The infant faces right, perhaps looking at Jesus, and has its left arm raised at 45 degrees. To the right of Jesus kneels a woman with five children to the right. The woman faces left and has her left leg extended backward. She wears her hair in a bun with a cord or ribbon round it. The woman's left arm is at her side but bent slightly, as if ushering forward the group of children to the left. The leftmost child of the group kneels, facing left and away. The child wears a gown and has his(?) arms bent upward, with his hands partly covering his face. The child is praying. A group of four children, probably including at least one girl, stands to the left of the woman. Only the head is visible of the leftmost child, who has short hair and faces left. The child second from the left has short, curly hair, wears a gown, and faces away. His(?) left foot is extended back and on tiptoe. Only the face of the child second from the right is visible, facing left. The rightmost child appears to be female. She faces forward, and wears a gown. The background is dotted with grass, indeterminate vegetation, and several leafy trees. The form on the right margin may be a large tree trunk. A river winds through the background and another body of water, possibly a lake, appears right of the kneeling woman's back. Mountains mark the horizon on the right. There are three buildings in the background, including two with columns and one with a tower and a spire. The sky is cloudy with indications of a sunrise or sunset emanating from behind the central tree.
