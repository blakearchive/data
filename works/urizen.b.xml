            The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of the electronic edition of <hi rend="i">The First Book of Urizen</hi> Copy B. One of eight extant copies--and one of two with all 28 plates--Copy B was acquired by the portrait painter George Romney, probably directly from Blake. Now in the Pierpont Morgan Library, it joins Copies A, C, F, and G in the Archive and will be joined by Copy D in the near future. The plate order for each of these copies is unique.<lb/><lb/><hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> is dated 1794 on its title plate, and the first six copies were color printed that year. Copy B was printed the following year and at first sight appears to have been color printed, but it was printed in one ink with watercolor washes and opaque colors applied in simulation of color printing. It was printed on large sheets of paper primarily in a light black ink, with hues of green and brown, as part of a deluxe set of illuminated books printed in the same format. Other books in the Archive from this set are <hi rend="i">All Religions are One</hi> Copy A and <hi rend="i">There is No Natural Religion</hi> Copy L; <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> Copy F; <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> Copy D; <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> Copy G; <hi rend="i">America a Prophecy</hi> Copies A and B; <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> Copy R.<lb/><lb/>

A fully gowned old man with closed eyes and long, flowing white hair and beard, presumably 
Urizen, sits cross-legged on a large book in the center foreground.  Centered behind him is a pair of stone tablets with arched tops, like 
tombstones.  Indeterminate dark forms, perhaps another branch of the arching tree, appear above and on both sides of the tablets.  Lying on the ground to the man's left and right are two sets of quadrangular stone tablets or books or, 
alternatively, the ends of a single long tablet, perhaps a coffin lid.  The dark background, trees, and tablets 
taken together suggest a graveyard setting.  Beneath Urizen's feet is an open book.  The toes of his 
right foot emerge from his beard to mark his place in the book.  Tree roots sprout to left and right 
in the foreground beneath the book and tablets.  Holding a writing instrument in each hand and 
resting his arms on the tablets to his left and right, Urizen seems to be copying from the book onto 
the tablets.  The instruments may be quills, graphite pencils, or etching needles.  Publication information is centered beneath the book.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="CD"><characteristic>Urizen</characteristic><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>old</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>sitting cross-legged</characteristic><characteristic>contracted</characteristic><characteristic>legs crossed</characteristic><characteristic>eyes closed</characteristic><characteristic>eyes down</characteristic><characteristic>arms raised horizontally</characteristic><characteristic>arms resting</characteristic><characteristic>right foot</characteristic><characteristic>knees</characteristic><characteristic>writing</characteristic><characteristic>copying</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A fully gowned old man with long, flowing white hair and beard, presumably Urizen,

male, hovers horizontally, facing out toward the viewer.  His position and the curved lower edge of the space he occupies suggest the sun.  (2) Air/Thiriel: 
Just below Fire, with nude body in an upward curve that reinforces the suggestion of a sun above, 
hovers a second figure, apparently male, with his hands raised to his chest and palms turned out.  (3) Earth/Grodna: At lower right crouches a nude male with short hair, head up, mouth 
open, and hands on the ground.  He seems to be emerging from the earth, represented by a wave-
washed island or peninsula of land.  (4) Water/Utha: At lower left, the upward-looking head of a
