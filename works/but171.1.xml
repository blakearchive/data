                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>This wash drawing depicts the Greek god Pan and another male figure, probably the shepherd Daphnis. Pan sits to the left in profile, his body facing right. He leans slightly back as he sits and hunches his shoulders forward. His head is down and slightly bent to the left, as if looking at the flute while leaning toward or listening to the male figure at his right. His right arm is bent at the elbow and he holds the bottom of the flute with his right hand. He appears to be teaching or showing Daphnis how to use the flute. Pan sits on an indeterminate object, perhaps a stump or a box, with his legs together and his left hoof crossed in front of the right hoof. His prominent right hindquarter is muscular, and part of his left hindquarter is visible behind it. His legs are covered in fur. He has long, swept back hair, a beard, and two small horns on his forehead. The shepherd Daphnis sits to the right, facing forward. The left side of his body is obscured by Pan. His arms are bent at the elbow and extended up. He holds the flute with both hands and brings it close to his face. He looks at Pan and sits close to him on the stump or box, twisting his body to turn toward him. His right leg is lifted up and bent at the knee, extending slightly outwards. His lower right leg might be resting between Pan’s hindquarters. His left leg crosses over and rests on his right ankle with his left foot placed next to Pan’s hooves. He has short curly hair. Both Pan and Daphnis are nude. The block or stump on which the figures sit has indeterminate decorative details running diagonally from top left to bottom right, including what may be a curved line and an outline that mimics the hindquarters of Pan. Shadows appear along Pan’s back and Daphnis’s chest. The block on which the figures sit rests on a bare floor. The background is plain, perhaps representing a bare wall behind the figures. A tentative pencil sketch depicts a portion of an arm below the main drawing.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>The shepherd Daphnis(?) sits to the right, facing forward. The left side of his body is obscured by Pan. His arms are bent at the elbow and extended up. He holds the flute with both hands and brings it close to his face. He looks at Pan and sits close to him on the stump or box, twisting his body to turn toward him. His right leg is lifted up and bent at the knee, extending slightly outwards. His lower right leg might be resting between Pan’s hindquarters. His left leg crosses over and rests on his right ankle with his left foot placed next to Pan’s hooves. He has short curly hair. Both Pan and Daphnis are nude.</illusobjdesc></component>
