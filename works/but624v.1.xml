                The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of fully searchable and scalable electronic editions of the following works related to Blake’s development of his illustrations to Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>: Preliminary Sketches for Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, listed under Drawings and Paintings, Pencil Sketches; Preliminary Drawings for Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, listed under Drawings and Paintings, Monochrome Wash Drawings; and Preliminary Illustrations to Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, listed under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.<lb/><lb/>
                In addition, we are republishing the following works, previously presented in our Preview mode, to make their designs fully searchable: Robert Blair, <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, the 1808 book listed under Commercial Book Illustrations, Designed by Blake and Engraved by Other Engravers; <hi rend="i">Deaths Door</hi>, listed under Separate Plates and Plates in Series, Designed and Engraved by Blake; and Illustrations to Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, the series of twenty finished designs, listed under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.<lb/><lb/>
                Taken together, these works in a variety of media present a comprehensive overview of one of Blake’s major projects as an illustrator and exemplify his working methods as he developed rough sketches into finished water colors.  The evolution of any one design can be traced via links presented under Related Works in the Archive on the pull-down menus, lower left on the main viewing page for each work. <lb/><lb/>
                In October 1805, Blake was commissioned by the engraver and would-be publisher Robert H. Cromek to prepare forty drawings illustrating Robert Blair's <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, a popular "Graveyard" school poem first published in 1743.  Cromek originally planned to select twenty of these designs for a deluxe edition of the poem.  Blake launched into the project with great enthusiasm, rapidly sketching out his illustrations in pencil, developing some into wash drawings, and then producing a group of more finished water colors for presentation to Cromek.  In a first prospectus of November 1805, Cromek names Blake as both the designer and engraver of fifteen designs.  Blake etched one image, <hi rend="i">Deaths Door</hi>, in white-line, but Cromek rejected it.  The dark power of the print appeals to modern tastes, but was far from fashionable in the early nineteenth century.  In a second prospectus, also of November 1805, Cromek announced that Louis Schiavonetti would engrave twelve designs for the new edition.  Blake had lost the potentially lucrative commission to engrave his own designs; his relationship with Cromek descended into anger and argument.  In spite of their disagreement, Cromek included a portrait of Blake as a frontispiece to the volume, published in 1808.  Cromek promoted the book aggressively and the illustrations to <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> became Blake's best known work through much of the nineteenth century. <lb/><lb/>

Each arch is separated by a column. This may be the doorway to heaven. Beams of light radiate downward from the portal. In the center of the image floats a gowned figure, probably male and rising, seen from behind. In the water color of this design, this figure is Christ. His legs are together, with his left leg slightly bent and extended backward. His ankles may be crossed and both feet are on tiptoe. His arms are raised at 135 degrees, palms held vertically or upward. To the left of the central figure is a group of at least four gowned figures, facing away or to the right. They may be standing or hovering; perhaps they are even rising with the central figure. The leftmost figure of the group may be a child. The figure second from the left may have long hair or a veil over its head, implying that it is female. The two rightmost figures bend slightly left. The figure second from the right raised its left(?)arm vertically. To the right of the central figure is a group of at least five gowned figures, facing away or to the left. They may be standing or hovering; perhaps they are even ascending after the central figure. The leftmost figure extends its left leg backward, slightly bent, with its arms raised vertically, palms together, in a gesture of prayer or supplication. The figure second from the right may have long hair or a veil over her head. She may be holding an infant in her arms. The rightmost figure may be a child. A few lines below the feet of the main, central figure suggest more small figures, possibly standing, hovering, or rising and possibly gowned.</illusobjdesc><component type="structure" location="E"><characteristic>Gothic art</characteristic><characteristic>arch</characteristic><characteristic>pillar</characteristic><characteristic>door</characteristic><characteristic>heaven</characteristic><characteristic>beams of light</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Three Gothic arches stand in the upper portion of the design, one at the center and two half arches seen on each side.
