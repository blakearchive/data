   The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an 
   electronic edition of Blake's ten monochrome wash drawings illustrating 
   Mary Wollstonecraft's <hi rend="i">Original Stories from Real Life</hi> and the first and 
   second editions of the book containing Blake's six engravings of his 
   designs. &#160;The designs and inscribed texts in all three series are fully 
   searchable and are supported by our Inote and ImageSizer applications.
  <lb/><lb/>
   In 1788, Joseph Johnson published the first edition of Mary 
   Wollstonecraft's morally instructive narrative for children, <hi rend="i">Original 
      Stories from Real Life; with Conversations, Calculated to Regulate the 
      Affections, and Form the Mind to Truth and Goodness</hi>. &#160;A few years later, 
   Johnson decided to issue a new edition, for which he commissioned Blake to 
   prepare a series of illustrations. &#160;Blake's extant drawings, now in the 
   Rosenwald Collection, Library of Congress, are datable to c. 1791. &#160;In 
   addition to these ten designs, Blake must have executed at least one 
   further drawing as a preliminary for his fifth plate; this drawing is 
   untraced. &#160;Six designs were selected for publication in the 1791 edition 
   of Wollstonecraft's book; Blake engraved the designs himself. &#160;The first 
   and second states of Blake's plates appear variously in copies of the 1791 
   edition.  The second edition to contain Blake's plates was published by 
   Johnson in 1796; it contains the third (final) states of Blake's plates. 
   The copy of the 1791 edition now in the Archive is from the Huntington 
   Library; it contains the second states of the plates.  The copy of the 
   1796 edition in the Archive is from the Essick collection and contains the 
   third (final) states of the plates.
   <lb/><lb/>
   Modern interpreters of the illustrations have detected a pictorial 
   critique of Wollstonecraft's stories. &#160;Blake appears to have found her 
   morality too calculating, rationalistic, and rigid. &#160;He represents 
   Wollstonecraft's spokesperson, Mrs. Mason, as a domineering presence. 
   &#160;From Blake's perspective, Mason's acts of charity are excessively 
   condescending and tend to reinforce the underlying social conditions that 
   create disparities between wealth and poverty. &#160;As Blake wrote in "The 
   Human Abstract," "Pity would be no more, / If we did not make somebody 
   Poor."

   With this publication, the Archive adds a new set of scholarly tools. 
   These tools, known collectively as our Related Works system, are designed 
   to show relationships among works and individual objects in the Archive. 
   They function at two levels.  First, work index pages now include active 
   links to related materials in the Archive (for example, a set of 
   preliminary sketches for a group of engravings).  Second, the Show Me menu 
   on object view pages now includes Related Works in the Archive.  Like the work-level menu, this list includes active 
   links to the related objects and is meant to allow study of the related 
   materials side-by-side.  The Wollstonecraft illustrations are the first 
   publication in the Archive to use this feature.
   <lb/><lb/>
   As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access 
   restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible 
   by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the cooperation of 
   the international array of libraries and museums that have generously 
   given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the 
   Archive.

She wears a hat and her long hair falls 
                  onto her shoulders.  Her arms rest in her lap, with her hands on her knees.  Her eyes are down and 
                  she appears to be smiling; she looks at the two  female children (Mary and Caroline) sitting to either side of her.  Both children 
                  have long hair; the figure on the left has hers drawn back into a braid.  The figure on the left is seen from the side, with her 
                  upper body turned away from the viewer.  Her right hand rests in the woman's lap.  Her head is down and rests in the 
                  woman's lap in an apparent expression of sorrow.  The figure on the right mirrors this position; she holds the woman's left arm 
                  with her left hand.  To the right of this group, a male figure sits in a chair facing left.  He is Jack, a sailor, with two of his 
                  children near him.  He wears a coat, breeches, shoes, and a scarf.  His left arm is bent and rests in his lap.  His crutch lies on 
                  the wooden floor below his left foot.  A child (possibly female and wearing a hat) stands behind and to the left of the seated man.  
                  She has her head down, and holds a scarf or cloth to her face.  The figure appears to stand, but her legs are not pictured.  A male 
                  child stands to the right of the seated male figure.  He may be leaning against the back of the chair.  He has short curly hair 
                  and his eyes are cast down.  His arms are crossed in front of his chest, with his left hand holding or 
                  resting on his right shoulder.  His legs are crossed at the ankles.  He may be wearing tights or a shirt and breeches.  The six 
                  figures appear in a room with a large fireplace.  A fire burns on a stack of wood kindling and smoke

                  and holds the hand of the adult woman; the girl's left arm is down and the fingers of her left hand are 
                  slightly spread.  The child on the left is partially obscured.  She may hold hands (with her left hand?) with the adult 
                  woman; her right arm is bent across her body.  Both children look towards the other figures in the scene with 
                  expressions suggesting pity or surprise.  Another female figure stands to the left of the doorway; she is the mother of 
                  the poor family that Mrs. Mason and her charges are visiting.  She is gowned  
                  and wears a tattered hat.  She faces forward, but her head is turned in 
                  profile to the right.  Her mouth is open; she is speaking to the woman to the right.  Her arms are 
                  crossed in front of her chest.  She holds a (nude?) infant, one of her children.  We see only the infant's head and 
                  upper body from behind.  The child has short, curly hair, and his or her left arm is bent.  An adult male 
                  figure, the father, sits in a chair in the lower half of the design.  He wears shoes, striped stockings, breeches, and a shirt.  His 
                  hair is short and curly.  His left arm rests on his lap with his hand on his knee.  His right arm is bent 
                  and supports his head, which is bent down.  His eyes are closed, and he wears an expression of despair, melancholy, or 
                  grief.  To the left of the seated figure, a male child sits in an extremely contracted position and 
                  leans with his shoulder against the wall.  He is facing forward, with his head turned slightly to the 
                  left.  The figure wears breeches and appears to have long hair.  His legs are drawn up and crossed at 
                  the ankles.  His right arm is at his side.  The child's eyes are closed and his mouth is slightly open; he may be 
                  crying in despair or grief.  The leftmost figure in this design is a male child seated on the floor with 
                  his back against the wall.  He wears breeches and a shirt or coat.  He faces to the right, with his legs 
                  extended together.  His right arm is at his side with his palm down.  His head is bent down, and he 
                  wears a rather blank expression.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="BD"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>Mason, Mrs.</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>hat</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>arms at side</characteristic><characteristic>hand holding</characteristic><characteristic>pity</characteristic><characteristic>listening</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><illusobjdesc>On the right of the design, an adult female (Mrs. Mason) stands between two female children.
