Solomon sits in judgment on a throne on a plinth or dais with eight steps that is also decorated with large images of male angels with curly hair, beards, and wings; each of these male angels is gowned and stands, facing away from Solomon, with three visible on the left and four five on the right. Solomon's throne appears to be fluted, like a pillar, on its sides or arms lower left and right of Solomon. He sits, facing forward, with his right arm raised at 45 degrees, pointing at the leftmost woman, at whom he appears to be looking. His left arm is raised at 45 degrees, with his fingers spread, perhaps gesturing to the swordsman to hold off on carrying out his order. His legs are drawn up slightly. He is gowned, with a cloak, and wears a crown. His hair is short and curly. The leftmost woman of the pair in the center of the design has long hair and wears a gown, the hem of which swirls to indicate swift movement. She stands, facing right, with her left leg extended backward, and her arms raised horizontally. Her mouth is open and she seems to be reaching for the child that the other woman holds. She is probably the child's mother. The rightmost woman in the center of the design is gowned and may wear her curly hair in a bun. She kneels, facing forward with the lower half of her body, but twists so that the upper half of her body faces right. Her arms are raised at 135 degrees, holding an infant that she appears to be handing to the swordsman to her right. Her mouth is slightly open. The swordsman to the right of the women stands, facing left, with his right leg extended back slightly and on tiptoe. He has short, curly hair and wears a cloak and short gown or breeches. His arms are at his sides, but bent at the elbow. He holds a sword in his right hand and reaches with his left for the infant that the woman to his right is handing to him, but he looks to his left at Solomon. The rightmost woman holds in her raised hands a nude infant, identified as male in the passage illustrated. The infant has short hair and faces left, with his arms raised horizontally and probably reaching back to his mother. Between the two women, on the floor, lies supine the body of an infant, identified as male in the passage illustrated. His arms are at his sides. This is the dead son of 1 Kings 3:22. A group of three male figures stand to the left of the leftmost woman. Each figure is gowned, with curly hair and a beard, and looks at the women. The leftmost figure faces forward, but looks slightly right. The middle figure faces away, with his right arm at his side, but bent at the elbow, with his palm vertical and fingers spread. He also looks to the right. His left leg is bent at the knee and may be on tiptoe. The figure on the right faces forward, looking slightly right. His left arm is at his side, palm down and fingers slightly spread. To the right of the rightmost woman stands a group of three men, each with long hair and a beard. The leftmost figure is gowned, and faces left and forward, with his right arm bent so that his hand is held to his upper chest. He looks down slightly at the woman below. Only the head of the middle figure is visible, facing left, and perhaps looking at Solomon. Only the head of the rightmost figure is visible as well, facing left and forward slightly, and perhaps looking at the leftmost group of figures or at Solomon. The scene is backed, upper left and right, by stone(?) columns or pillars with arches between them.
