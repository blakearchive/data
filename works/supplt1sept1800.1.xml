                        dimensions (height x width) are given according to the vertical orientation
                        of the body of Blake's letter; see the note on Number of Leaves, below.
                        Object 1 has been reoriented vertically in the Object View Page, as would be
                        customary when reading the address.</note></objsize>

                    <note>The full sheet was folded to form two leaves. The letter
                        appears on the first recto (Object 2), first verso (Object 3), and second
                        recto (Object 4) of the folded sheet. This folded sheet was folded further
                        to form a sealed packet for posting. The address appears on the second verso
                        (Object 1), which would have been the exterior of the folded packet. The
                        unfolded full sheet views of the letter are available under Supplemental
                        Views on the Show Me pull-down menu for those objects.</note></numberleaves>

                <note>Early history unknown, but this letter apparently passed from a member of the
                    Cumberland family living in or near Bristol to the family of Lord Coleridge (6th
                    Baron Coleridge) at an unknown time; acquired from Lord Coleridge by private
                    treaty in December 1997 by Robert Essick, John Windle acting as agent. This
                    letter was brought to the attention of Morton D. Paley by Lord Coleridge in the
                    summer of 1997.</note>
