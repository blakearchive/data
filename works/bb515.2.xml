      The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of two copies—one uncolored and one hand colored—of Blake's engraved illustrations to Edward Young's <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> (1797). Both copies are presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (our image annotation program).<lb/><lb/>
      With what must have been enormous energy, Blake executed 537 water colors illustrating the poem's nine sections, which Young called "Nights," for the publisher Richard Edwards. The 1797 volume included a selection of illustrations for the first four Nights, but Edwards closed his publishing business before any further volumes could be issued. Many copies include a two-page "Explanation of the Engravings," possibly written by Blake's friend and fellow-artist Henry Fuseli. The texts of these commentaries are included in the Editor's Notes for each plate.<lb/><lb/>
      The colorist(s) of the twenty-seven traced colored copies have never been convincingly identified. The copy now published in the Archive, from the Huntington Library, was very probably colored shortly after publication.<lb/><lb/>
      As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible through the continuing support of the Library of Congress, the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and by the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.

The figure is gowned and has long hair and a beard. Both feet are visible below the hem of his gown and his right foot may be raised on tiptoe. Death's right arm is down with the hand held down and the fingers spread.  He may be touching the small figures to the right of his right hand. His left arm is not visible, but his left hand rests on his left knee with the palm turned up. An arrow with the tip pointing downward and the curved end of a bow are visible to the left of Death's right foot. The six figures below death likely represent a family. A female in a sleeveless gown sits in the lower portion of the design. She is likely the mother of the five nearby children. The figure faces forward with her head turned to the left; she may look down towards the nude, curly-haired child. The mother's right arm is bent upward and her left arm is down at her side. A distaff balances against her right arm and she holds a string or strand of thread with both hands. An open book with distinct pages rests on the female's right knee. Two children of indeterminate gender stand to the left of the seated female, facing right. Both are apparently gowned and have long hair. The child to the right holds a lyre, while the child to the left plays it. A nude child with curly hairpossibly malestands to the left of the seated female. He faces right in profile with his right leg bent back and his right foot raised on tiptoe. The right half of his body is cast in shadow. Both arms are raised at 135 degrees and extend up and to the right with the palms turned up. He holds a scroll with both hands and he may be reaching towards his mother to give her the scroll. A child of indeterminate gender stands to the left of the seated female. The figure is partially obscured by the figure to the left. The child has long hair and its head may be down; it may read the book resting on the mother's right knee. A gowned child with long hairpossibly malesits on the ground below the adult female. The child faces left in profile with his shoulders hunched slightly and his head down. He may be smiling. His left arm rests on his lap and he holds a tablet or sheet of paper in his left hand. His right arm rests on the tablet and he holds a quill pen in his right hand. Green wash below the figures of Death and the family may indicate grass. A shadow falls across the grass directly below the figures. A nude female spirit with long hair stands on the palm of Death's left hand. She is seen from behind and faces away from the viewer with her head bent back. The figure's buttocks are prominent. She stands with her legs together with both feet raised on tiptoe and her ankles touching. Both arms are raised vertically with the palms held vertically; she is probably reaching upwards. A gowned female with long hair flies or hovers in the upper right portion of the design; she may rise upward. The figure is transparent, as indicated by the horizontal lines of the sky running through her. She probably represents a soul or spirit. The figure faces left with her head turned up slightly. Her arms are raised at 135 degrees with the palms turned up. A pair of winged angels fly or hover in the upper portion of the design. The figure closest to the viewer is gowned and has long hair; the other figure is partially obscured so that only the head, left arm, and wing are clearly visible. Both figures may be female. The angels' bodies are horizontal with their heads to the right. Each figure extends a single arm to the right with the palm held out to the right. They may reach toward the transparent spirit to the right. The figure in back appears to be smiling. The upper portion of the sky is filled with clouds. Darkness or dark shadows appear in the sky to the left and right of Death.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>Death</characteristic><characteristic>old</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>sitting</characteristic><characteristic>crouching</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent</characteristic><characteristic>tiptoe</characteristic><characteristic>eyes closed</characteristic><characteristic>eyes down</characteristic><characteristic>feet</characteristic><characteristic>arm down</characteristic><characteristic>fingers spread</characteristic><characteristic>touching</characteristic><characteristic>hand on knee</characteristic><characteristic>palm up</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>supporting</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Death, in the character of an old man, sits or crouches in the lower portion of the design.

He wears a gown or else may be wrapped in a sheet or blanket. The figure lies partially on his side with his torso twisted into a semi-prone position. His head rests on an open book with his eyes closed; he is sleeping and likely dreaming. The figure's left arm is bent and rests on the open book. His left palm is turned down and he holds a quill pen in his left hand. Both legs are bent and his feet are touching. The ground below the figure may be covered with grass. A dense forest of leafy trees appears in the lower left portion of the design. Two trunks are clearly visible; each divides into two distinct branches. Grass may appear on the ground below the rightmost tree trunk. A nude male with short hair stands on a path or road above the sleeping poet's head. He faces left with his legs spread and his left leg bent backward. His left foot is raised on tiptoe and he may walk to the left. The figure bends forward with his shoulders hunched slightly. Both arms are bent with the palms held vertically in front of his chest. A nude male with short, possibly curly hair flies or hovers in the upper left portion of the design; he may rise upward. The figure faces forward with his head turned up and to the right. His left leg is bent and drawn up. The figure's right arm is bent slightly and raised at 135 degrees; his right palm is turned up. His left arm is raised horizontally; his left hand is partially obscured by the text panel, but may be turned down. A nude male hovers or flies in the upper left portion of the design. The figure's legs are spread apart and he may run to the right. His right leg is bent slightly and extends backward (to the left). His left foot is obscured by the text panel. The figure's right arm is raised horizontally and extends to the right. He holds hands with the gowned female to the right. The female figure flies or hovers in the upper portion of the design; alternatively, she may stand on the upper edge of the text panel. She faces left in profile with her body twisted. Her left arm is raised nearly horizontally and extends to the left. She holds hands with the nude male to the left. A nude male appears in the upper right portion of the design at the corner of the text panel. He faces forward with his upper body twisted to the left and his head turned to the right. He appears to be in a contracted position with his right leg bent and drawn up. His right leg dangles to the right of the text panel. Both arms extend down and to the left; he holds a leafless branch with his right hand. His left hand and right foot are obscured by the text panel. A nude male appears upside down to the right of the text panel; he is likely falling. The figure is seen from behind with his buttocks prominent. His right leg is bent and drawn up with the sole of his right foot turned out towards the viewer. His left leg extends up and slightly left. The figure's head appears to be bent back. Both arms are bent and he likely clutches at his head with both hands. A body of water, perhaps a lake or the sea, appears in the lower right portion of the design. The head, shoulders, and right foot of a male figure appear in the water below the lower left corner of the text panel. The figure is seen from behind and faces away from the viewer. His arms are raised horizontally with the palms turned down. His right foot is visible below and to the left of his left hand with the sole turned up. He is likely swimming.

The ground slopes to the right of the figures, suggesting that they rest on a hillside. A large stone extends to the left and right of the figures. The left edge of the stone is cast in shadow. The ground below the figures may be covered in grass. A large mass of indeterminate, leafy vegetation appears above and to the left of the figures. Leafy vegetation also appears directly below the female figure. A male figure reclines against a stone in the lower portion of the design. He is likely the father of the infant to the right. The figure faces forward with his head bent back and his eyes closed. His long hair falls to the right. A snake or serpent wraps around the figure's torso and legs. The "Explanation to the Engravings" indicates that the man is dead or dying of a snake bite. The figure is partly nude and wears a skirt or other drapery. Both legs are bent to the left with his left leg partially obscured by the right. Both arms are raised horizontally and rest on the stone. His left hand clearly rests on the stone with the palm down; the right hand is less distinct, but likely also rests with the palm turned down. A snake or serpent appears in the lower portion of the design, wrapped around the male figure's torso. Its head appears above the figure's right shoulder, facing right. Its mouth is open and tongue extended. The serpent's tail forms a single loop. Mottled patches on its body suggest scales. A gowned female with long hair appears in the lower right portion of the design. She faces right in profile and kneels on the ground with at least her right leg bent. The figure bends forward and both arms extend down and to the right; she reaches out and holds a nude child. She is likely the child's mother. The child, probably male, kneels facing right in profile with his mouth open. The figure bends forward so that his body is nearly horizontal. Both arms are raised and extend to the right; the child reaches toward the bird to the right. The left palm faces out toward the viewer and the right palm faces away; the fingers on both hands are spread. A bird flies on outstretched wings in the lower right portion of the design. The bird faces right. Coloring and etched lines on the bird's wings and back indicate feathers. A flock of eight birds flies to the left of the text panel. The two largest birds face up and may rise upward. Both have long tails. Etched lines on the birds' wings suggest feathers. Horizontal lines and blue wash above the figures indicate sky; white space suggests clouds. Two vines appear along the upper, left, and right borders of the text panel. They may be joined together directly above the number "12." The vine to the left has at least sixteen leaves. At the upper left corner of the text panel, the vine forms a spiral of three coiled loops. The vine to the right has at least forty-one leaves. At the upper right corner of the text panel, the vine forms a spiral that arches up and to the left. Below, another spiral is more clearly formed by a series of eight coiled loops.

His left palm is turned down with the thumb spread apart from the fingers, a gesture that suggests he is measuring time. His right palm is vertical and he holds the handle of a scythe in his right hand. Veins are clearly distinguishable on the figure's forearms, hands, left foot, and right calf. The figure casts a shadow on the ground below.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="B"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>eyes closed</characteristic><characteristic>sleeping</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>leaning</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent</characteristic><characteristic>legs crossed</characteristic><characteristic>tiptoe</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent</characteristic><characteristic>arm resting</characteristic><characteristic>head down</characteristic><characteristic>head on arm</characteristic><characteristic>bending left</characteristic><characteristic>twisted</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A gowned female stands above the text panel.

The figure's wings extend up and to the right. His legs are bent and spread apart; the right leg is bent forward while the left is bent back with his left foot raised on tiptoe.  He is probably running to the left with a giant stride. The figure's left shoulder is prominent; his left arm is not visible. Time's right hand appears to the right of the text panel, holding a large scythe. The blade of the scythe curves down and to the left, towards the group of figures below. At least three figures lie on the ground below Time's left leg. The figures are laid out horizontally with their heads to the right. The visible eyes of two figures are closed and they are likely dead. Each figure is gowned; a sheet or shroud covers other corpses to the right. The lower figure has long hair and a beard. He wears a crown and may a king. The upper figure wears a hooded cloak or helmet with a plume; he may be a soldier. At least eleven figures appear in the lower left portion of the design. Shadows among the group suggest additional, indistinct figures. A gowned female with long hair stands furthest left. She faces forward with her head turned slightly left. Her right arm is bent and she holds an infant to her exposed breast. The female is likely the infant's mother, and may also be the mother of the child below. A male child with short hair stands second from the left (not counting the infant in the woman's arms). He is seen from behind and faces away from the viewer. His left arm is down by his side and his right arm is raised vertically. He reaches toward and may touch or hold the gown of the female above. A gowned female with long hair stands third from the left. She faces forward and is partially obscured by the figures to the left and right. A gowned male stands fourth from the left, facing left. The figure is old with long hair and a beard. His left arm is bent and he holds an open book on his forearm. The figure's right hand may rest on the book with the palm down. His head is slightly down with his eyes cast down; he looks at and may read the book. The figure standing fifth from the left is seen from behind. He or she is gowned and has long hair. The figure standing sixth from the left faces left. He or she is gowned and wears a hat. A male child with short hair stands seventh from the left. He faces left with his head turned away from the viewer. His right leg is bent slightly and his left leg extends back and to the right; he may be dancing or running. His left arm is bent upward and he holds a hat above his head. A smiling female with long hair stands eighth from the left, facing forward. She is partly nude and wears a skirt with her breasts exposed. Drapery or a plume appears above her hair. Her right leg extends back and to the right with the foot raised on tiptoe; she may be walking or dancing. Both arms are raised at 135 degrees; the figure holds a chalice or goblet in her right hand and she holds hands with the figure to the right. A gowned female with long hair stands ninth from the left. She is seen from behind and faces left with her head turned away from the viewer. The figure's left arm is bent upward and her right arm is raised horizontally. She holds hands with the figures to the left and right. Her left leg is apparently bent and extends backward and to the right. Her left foot is raised on tiptoe and she may be walking or dancing. A gowned female child with long hair stands furthest right. The child's legs are apparently spread and she may walk or run to the left. Both arms are bent upward and to the left. Her right palm is held vertically and her left hand holds the hand of the figure to the left. The child's head is turned forward and she looks down and to the right towards the corpses below.

He is identified as the poet in the "Explanation of the Engravings." The figure faces to the right with his head bent back and turned upward in profile. His right eye is raised and he may look at the sun or the figure of Apollo. His mouth is open slightly. The poet's right arm rests against his lap at a 45 degree angle with the palm held vertically. He casts a shadow to the left. A gowned female with long hairlikely Narcissalies on her side to the right of the poet. She is seen from behind and faces away from the viewer.

A vine-like protrusion extends upward from the lower portion of the plant; it forms two loops as it wraps around the stem. The flower has distinct petals and may represent a sunflower. The upper body of a nude figure, probably female, with long hair appears above the flower; it likely represents the personification of the sunflower. The figure is seen from behind with its head bent back and turned upward. Both arms are raised at 135 degrees with at least the left palm turned up; the figure's right hand is partially obscured by the text panel. A body of water with visible wavesperhaps the seaappears above and to the right of the couple. The sun appears in the sky above the couple. The sun is surrounded and partially obscured by dark clouds. The sun's low position and red coloring in the clouds suggests sunrise or sunset. The head of a male figure with long hair appears above the text panel, within the disc of the sun. He faces to the right in profile. The figure likely represents Apollo. A horse's head appears to the right of the text panel, within the disc of the sun. Its mane extends upward and to the left. The horse's head is down and its mouth is open. A bit is visible in the horse's mouth; the bit may be attached to a rein barely visible at the edge of the text panel. Six bent legs are visible below the horse's head, indicating additional, obscured horses. The horse(s) likely run down and to the right.

Christ's right arm is raised at 135 degrees and his left arm is raised horizontally. Both palms are held vertically and he may touch the clouds to the left and right. Two gowned and winged angels kneel in the lower portion of the design. The figure to the left has long hair; the angel's head is down and he or she faces right in profile. The figure to the right has curly hair; he faces left in profile and holds a drapery, probably Christ's shroud. Both figures cast shadows below. If the drapery is indeed Christ's shroud, then the lowest portion of the design represents part of his tomb. Blue wash surrounding Christ indicates sky. Two clouds appear to the upper left and right. The cloud to the right is dark and partially shadowed.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>Christ</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>mustache</characteristic><characteristic>mouth open</characteristic><characteristic>hovering</characteristic><characteristic>flying</characteristic><characteristic>rising</characteristic><characteristic>stigmata</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent</characteristic><characteristic>leg drawn up</characteristic><characteristic>bending left</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised at 135 degrees</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised horizontally</characteristic><characteristic>palms vertical</characteristic><characteristic>hands raised, palms out</characteristic><characteristic>touching</characteristic><characteristic>aura</characteristic><characteristic>halo</characteristic><characteristic>beams of light</characteristic><characteristic>radiance</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Christ flies or hovers in the center of the design, rising from the tomb.
