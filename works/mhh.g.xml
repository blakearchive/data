                                    The William Blake Archive www.blakearchive.org is pleased to announce the publication of new electronic editions of <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> Copy G and <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> Copy P, both printed c. 1818. This is the first reproduction of <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> Copy G and the first full color reproduction of <hi rend="i">Visions</hi> Copy P since the badly-degraded filmstrips produced by Micro Methods Ltd. in the 1970s.<lb/><lb/><hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> Copy G is in the Houghton Library, Harvard University, and <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> Copy P is in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge. They join copies of <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> and <hi rend="i">Visions</hi> from other printings: <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> Copies C (1790), H (1790/1821), F (1794), D (1795), and I (1827), and <hi rend="i">Visions</hi> Copies C and J (1793), F (1794), and G (1795). Other copies of <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> and <hi rend="i">Visions</hi> are forthcoming: <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> Copy K (Plates 21-24) and Copies L and M (Plates 25-27), from the first printing of the plates in 1790, with Plates 24 and 25 in first states; and <hi rend="i">Visions</hi> Copy O, printed with Copy P.<lb/><lb/>
                                    The electronic editions have newly edited SGML-encoded texts and new images scanned and color-corrected from first-generation 4x5" transparencies; text and images are each fully searchable and supported by the Inote and ImageSizer applications described in our previous updates. With the Archive's recently added comparison feature, users can easily juxtapose multiple impressions of any plate across the different copies of an illuminated book.<lb/><lb/>
                                    With the publication of these two titles, the Archive now contains fully searchable and scalable electronic editions of 45 copies of 18 of Blake's 19 illuminated books in the context of full bibliographic information about each work, careful diplomatic transcriptions of all texts, detailed descriptions of all images, and extensive bibliographies. They also join our searchable SGML-encoded electronic edition of David V. Erdman's <hi rend="i">Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</hi>. With the forthcoming publication of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> Copy E, the Archive will contain at least one copy of each of Blake's works in illuminated printing and multiple copies of most.<lb/><lb/><hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> Copy G, one of nine extant copies, is the only copy with a variant plate order (1-11, 15, 14, 12, 13, 16-27) that can be traced directly to Blake, and it is the first of his last two copies in which the cave and rock forms on Plates 10, 11, 15, and 20 were printed. These forms were part of the original designs as executed on the plates but were wiped of ink in all earlier copies and thus did not print; they show up only in this copy and Copy I.<lb/><lb/>
                                    The early histories of <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> Copy G and <hi rend="i">Visions</hi> Copy P are not known, but they were bound together (with <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> Copy N) until 1890. They also share the same printing session and printing and coloring styles. Both are printed in red-orange ink on one side of RUSE &amp; TURNERS/1815 paper and finished in watercolors and pen and ink. Each impression is numbered in the top right corner and bordered by one thin line drawn in red-orange ink a little over a centimeter around the image, setting off each page like a miniature painting. These extraordinarily beautiful copies were produced in the same session with other books in the Archive: <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> Copy O and <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen</hi> Copy G. This late style, which Blake also used c. 1821-22 and 1825-27, can be seen in other books in the Archive: <hi rend="i">America a Prophecy</hi> Copy O and <hi rend="i">Europe a Prophecy</hi> Copy K, published earlier this year, <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> Copies Z and AA, and <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> Copy I.<lb/><lb/>
                                    The editors of the Archive recently photographed over 1250 works by Blake in the British Museum, Department of Prints and Drawings, including all 537 water colors illustrating Edward Young's <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> and hundreds of pencil sketches (nine newly discovered), drawings, and watercolors. Over the next few years, we will be adding this extensive collection of books, prints, and drawings to the Archive. Many of these works will be reproduced in color for the first time.

Near the bottom of the plate, beneath the word "hell" (line 7), a nude couple,
perhaps (though not distinctly) female (left) and male (right), kiss
while embracing.  They are probably intended to represent the "marriage"
of "heaven" and "hell" (lines 3, 5, 7).  The figure on the right, facing left with 
body twisted forward, is stretched out horizontally on a cloud; the figure on
the left, facing right but with the body seen from behind, hovers above
a burst of flames.  Above them several other figures, including
embracing couples, fly upward between the flames on the left and the
clouds (of smoke?) on the right.  Above them in turn, at ground level,
in a landscape of leafless arching trees whose roots are visible below
ground, as if seen in cross-section, a couple strolls on the left and a
single figure kneels beside another figure lying on the ground.  Birds

heraldic vignette announces "The voice of the Devil" (lines 2-3): three angels blow
their trumpets on either side of these lines.  To
                              the left of the text, two of the angels—one gowned, the other
                              apparently nude—face up and left; to the right of the text, the third
angel, also gowned, mirrors its companions, facing up and right.  A
looped, vine-like extension grows from the ascender of "all" in line 4. 
Beside the lone angel on the right, a vine rises from the first letter
of "been" in line 4; alternatively, one might interpret the motif (in
spite of the green tinting) as a bird, flying left, whose tail touches
the ascender of "been."  Its fantastic plume contains a single loop, a
feature that continues the vegetative motif of the scene.  To the right
of the vine or bird ascends a smaller winged creature, either a bird or
an insect, and to its left, three leaf-like flags extend from the "d" of
"sacred" and the "h" of "have" in line 4.  These flags may represent the
musical notes of the trumpeters, although their green coloring in this
copy emphasizes their vegetable nature.  Below the winged bird or
insect, at the end of line 5, are two hovering figures facing each
other, a gowned female on the left and a child or infant on the right. 
Further down, to the right of line 6, a small figure, its body and arms
horizontal, flees from a recumbent figure on a leaf.  Next to the words
"the Soul" in line 10 are seven figures in sundry positions.  There may
be two huddled figures facing each other.  The figure on the right in
this group crouches or squats, reaching an arm out to its companion. 
They are followed by two tiny figures hovering and facing each other. 
They may be holding hands.  The hand-holding figures hover above a vine-
like streamer extending from the "M" of "Man" in line 11.  Next to this
pair, three figures huddle together on some vegetation consisting of
leaves and/or tufts of grass.  Following the word "Energies" in line 12
are four figures and two animals: the first animal, perhaps a horse,
kicks up its back heels.  Next to it stand two children holding hands,
followed by another hand-holding pair, a child and an adult.  The latter
extends his left arm horizontally, perhaps pointing to the ox which
grazes nearby on a bit of tableland.  An ornamental ribbon, most likely
vegetative in nature, closes the vignette.  Further down the plate,
three leaves grow from the "B" of "But" in line 13.  A branch with spiky
leaves grows from the "e" of "age" in line 17.  Following it, a
horizontal figure hovers above a wispy line, suggesting a cirrus-like
cloud.  The figure raises its arm, seemingly in an effort to make
contact with the adjacent figure, who hovers, legs spread and one arm
reaching to the left, above a line of vegetation.  To the right, a man
walks a small dog on a leash.  The forms on each side of the man and dog
may be the stumps of trees.  Facing left, a lumbering figure, bearded or
blindfolded, walks (runs?) in a contorted position, viz., bending
forward from the waist with one arm outstretched in front of him. 
Mimicking his general posture, an anthropomorphic tree arches to the
left.  Near the margin between lines 18 and 19 stands a small figure,
possibly holding a cane.  Six or seven figures observe another figure
one line down.  With legs slightly apart and arms raised, it appears to
address its audience.  To its back is either a tree with a
disproportionally large branch or leaf.  Concluding the procession, two
horses, the second of which is indicated merely by some faint profile
lines, pull a figure in its cart.  Background coloring suggests sky,
perhaps as a continuation of the major design below the
text.</illusobjdesc><component type="object" location="E"><characteristic>sky</characteristic><characteristic>sunrise</characteristic><characteristic>sunset</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Background coloring in the text area suggests sky, perhaps

extended arms holds an indeterminate object.  Another figure, also with
outstretched arms, reaches in the direction of the first figure.  A
vine-like, serpentine tail or vegetative motif extends behind it. 
Various other vegetative motifs, sometimes growing from letters, adorn
the plate.  At the end of line 8, a gowned figure hangs suspended from
the "g" of "flaming."  As "The voice of the Devil" (Plate 4, lines 2-3) is
bracketed by a pair of heralds with trumpets, "A Memorable Fancy" (line 15) is
bracketed by an upright gowned figure rising from the flames (left) and
an upside-down figure falling into them (right).  Poised above the "w"
of "walking" in line 16 is a figure with arms raised horizontally and
one leg extended backward.  At the bottom of the plate, blue coloring
and some spiky forms suggest a stormy sea or sky with clouds and perhaps
a bolt of lightning.  Fragments of letters seem to be emerging on the
left: most likely "HOW," (first letter not clear in this copy [line 27]) which
begins the devil's question, "How do you know," as written with
corroding fires on the sides of the rock and "now percieved by the minds

"Hell," a many-looped tendril of a grapevine descends toward the leafy
vine right of line 4.  The grapevine motif is reproduced elsewhere, and
various leaves, buds, serpentine vines and/or flowers adorn the plate
passim.  Dangling from the end of line 5 is a cluster of grapes. 
Further down, in the right margin, a flock of birds soars on extended
wings.  A detached vine or branch with leaves appears in the general
space occupied by the birds, coinciding with one of their wings.  Line
16 is teeming with small-scale designs: An eagle, lion, two figures, and
some grazing sheep appear in close proximity to one another.  Below,
next to "rod" in line 19, a small figure, perhaps a child, peers up at a
vaguely anthropomorphic tree.  Following "fruits" in line 23 is a vine
with leaves.  To the right, numerous birds fly above a picturesque
seascape, complete with boats or ships, and a tree grows from the side
of a cliff overlooking the water.  Two lines down, a coiled snake faces
a leaping stag.  A grapevine with leaves follows line 30.

same line, a figure reclines in a vegetative hammock in several other
copies, but in this copy the green tinting obscures any such figure and
converts the motif into a curved vine.  In the bottom right corner of
the plate, a couple hovers against a backdrop of sky.  Elsewhere
throughout the plate, washes suggest a sky at sunrise or sunset, perhaps
with clouds.</illusobjdesc><component type="object" location="E"><characteristic>sky</characteristic><characteristic>sunrise</characteristic><characteristic>sunset</characteristic><characteristic>cloud</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Throughout the plate, washes suggest a sky at sunrise or

it is attached to a looped tendril.  Other vegetative designs adorn the
plate passim: a long, slender branch with leaves or buds follows
"contemptible" in line 6; a plant and a leaf(?) follow line 14; some
flame-like leaves appear in the right margin above "and" in line 16
(integrated, in this copy, with the flames from the major design); and a
leaf appears left of line 17.  To the left of "Enough! or Too much" in
line 18 is a small sprig of ivy.  Numerous figures populate the plate,
all of which are concentrated in the spaces following the text of lines
8 and 14.  After line 8, four figures appear.  Of these, two face each
other; at least the lower figure appears to be lying on the ground or on
a cloud.  A third figure, adjacent to the other pair, lies supine(?) on
a gentle slope, which resembles a cloud.  To the right, the last figure
of this group raises its arms horizontally and extends one leg backward.

recalling a similar motif on Plate 8, stretches to the right margin
following the word "contemptible" in line 6.  Two lines down (line 8), in the

child, stands ensconced in the curved extension of the "A" in "And." 
Toward the bottom of the plate, following "things" in line 15, is a
group of sundry figures, all but one of whom are huddled or kneeling on
the ground.  The figure(?) bracketing the group on the left may be an
anthropomorphic tree stump.  On the far right, a headless body walks
left, holding a sword in its right hand.  The green coloring right of
this figure suggests vegetation of some sort.  Blue tinting here and

leaf attached to a looped vine following "Priesthood" in line 14
constitutes the plate's most visible vegetative design.  A vine,
possibly looped, dangles from the "d" of "reside" (line 16) and into the
right margin.  Hovering above "percieve" in line 6 is a vine and leaf
combination that resembles the nearby vine or serpent stretching across

looped vine.  Three swirls curve above the vegetation, and a small
figure dances(?).  Two birds fly above the text.  To the right of the
inscription, a monkey-like figure strides across a vine.  Left of line
3, a (grape?) leaf introduces "The Prophets."  The plate as a whole is
rich with vegetative swirls and lines, which are often vine-like or
serpentine, though those above "saw" in line 8 resonate with the image
of outspread wings of soaring birds, such as those found above lines 7

descenders of letters.  Wedged between the right margin and the word
"imposition" at the end of line 7 is a looping vine or possibly a worm. 
At the beginning of line 8, a snake with open mouth precedes the word
"Isaiah."  Hovering above text and among swirls, hovering figures appear

At the end of line 2, a scrolled shape with wavy lines intersecting its
midsection has been seen as a sea creature entangled in the remnants of
a net; the scene as a whole is said to illustrate the text that
continues from the previous plate, which describes Swedenborg's self-
deceptions: he imagines "himself the single / one on earth that ever
broke a net" (Plate 21, lines 14-15; Plate 22, line 2).  In this copy, the shape seems vegetative or worm-like. 
Beyond this shape, a hunched figure (possibly holding a book or tablet)
sits on a vine.  Following "falshoods" in line 5, a figure clad in a
billowing garment hovers amidst some vegetation.  Below, two elaborate
spirals radiate from a common center right of line 9.  To the right of
"further" in line 12 are several large, vivid leaves.  Next to "number"
in line 17, three birds soar on extended wings.  To the left of the
long-tailed bird and below the small, nondescript bird are two swollen
vegetable forms.  A loop extending above the "h" of "he" at the end of
line 18 coincides with the wing of the largest bird.  Four figures bound
the plate's inscription, "A Memorable Fancy" (line 21), on three sides. 
The first figure reclines beneath some leaves and branches to the left
of the text.  The vegetation transforms into loops and squiggles
clinging to the margin of the plate.  Above the inscription (line 21), a hovering
figure, arm(s) extended, seems to reach for a serpent.  The four-looped
vine growing from the "F" of "Fancy" and the squiggly "y" of the same
word continue the serpentine motif.  To the right of the text, the third
figure of the vignette stands facing right with arms raised at 135
degrees.  His head is bent back, and his posture suggests he has just
been impaled by the invisible arrow released from the bow of the fourth
figure, who leaps through the air brandishing the weapon.  Behind him, a
snake or vine coils around a tall tuft of grass.  Further down, a flower
with leaves and/or thorns adorns the space following "words" in line 24. 
Right of the flower is an oddly-shaped vine, or perhaps a flying bird or
insect appears to carry a snake through the air, recalling similar
motifs on Plates 5, 15, and 19.  Vegetable forms follow,  with another
large leaf or vine extending horizontally below line 26,
lower left.  Ornamenting the left margin are various other small-scale
vegetative designs attached to letters.</illusobjdesc><component type="object" location="E"><characteristic>sky</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Blue and yellow washes throughout the plate suggest

hunched-over figure sits with its head resting on its knees at one end
of a serpentine vegetative motif.  Completing the vignette is another
figure striding along the wavy ascender of "the" in line 3.  Its
position and gestures are ambiguous: the figure possibly faces right, a
scarf floating behind it.  Alternatively, one might view the figure as
facing left, grasping a disproportionally large scrolled shape; the
design would then perhaps illustrate the angel of lines 3 and 4
"embracing the flame of fire."  Next to "Elijah" at the end of line 5, a
gowned figure hovers, facing left (not clearly printed in this copy).  A
winged figure, also poorly printed in this copy, seen from behind hovers
in the left margin between lines 5 and 6; vine-like forms appear to the
                              right.  A serried scene of five sundry figures—flanked by books on the
                              right and more books, or possibly vegetation, on the left—also appears
between the text of lines 5 and 6.  Each of the figures sits or kneels. 
To the left of the first figure is an uncertain shape: possibly the
profile of a horse or another figure.  A small horse (minimally printed
in this copy) leaps right above "world" in line 9.  Following "well" at
the end of the same line, a figure runs rightward, reaching for a
vertical object which is more clearly a small child in other copies. 
The top half of the plate is dense with interlinear loops, vines,
banners, and leaves, e.g., the vines and/or roots on either side of the
figures populating the space between lines 5 and 6; the looped vines
growing from the descender of "my" and the ascender of "friend," both in
line 7; the elaborate curlicues following the text of line 11; and the
small branch with spiky leaves extending from the "l" of "also" in line
                              10.  Wing-like vegetable objects and/or soaring birds grace the plate—

otherwise draped.  To the right of these figures, another tree(?) arches
right, its leafless branch seemingly pointing toward a serpentine vine

down, a snake (or simply a line?) extends from "away" in line 13 to the
right margin.  A relatively large-scale interlinear branch and leaf
combination ornaments the space beside "rocks" in line 19.  Hovering
above "then" in line 22, a somewhat shadowy figure faces right, its body
horizontal.  It extends one arm forward, touching the hand of a sitting

and his retinue of lines 16-18, appears after "king" in line 24: the
first figure stands facing right; the second sits cross-legged(?) on the

arms outstretched.  Above "his" at the end of line 25 is a vivid leaf.

and in the right and left bottom corners.  Following "dismay" in line 4,
                              a figure holds a staff—or a scepter if one takes him for the "starry" (Plate 25, line 19) and "gloomy" (Plate 26, line 24) king of this "Song of Liberty" (Plate 25, line 2).  He kneels on one leg and
points(?) toward another figure with his left arm, raised horizontally. 
Running amidst wispy clouds, this second figure may represent the "son
of fire in his eastern / cloud," who is named in lines 5 and 6 and in
whose direction the king of the text casts his eyes.  Three lines down (line 9),
two horses, one of which is mounted, gallop leftward in the direction of
                              another horse(?)—this one recumbent—and an indistinct form, both of
which rest on some grassy tableland.  The horse motif reappears midway
down the design, where two horses flank the inscription "Chorus" in line
14.  The horse on the left gallops or leaps toward the text.  Its
companion rears up on hind legs, arching its head and back.  A small
bird soars to the right of and above "Chorus," which is circumscribed by
                              vegetative flourishes, including wavy, serpentine lines.  Above line 22, a flock of birds—the largest an eagle with head
                              held high—soars on extended wings.  Various other vegetative motifs
adorn the plate, e.g., the looped vines growing from the "t" of "breast"
and the "d" of "accepted" in lines 7 and 17, respectively; a small leaf-
bearing branch below "Spurning" in line 8; and the vegetable ribbon
extending from the descender of "Holy" in line 22.</illusobjdesc><component type="object" location="E"><characteristic>sky</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Thin blue washes suggest sky right and left of "Chorus" (line 14)
