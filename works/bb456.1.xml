                The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of Blake’s etchings/engravings of John Flaxman’s <hi rend="i">Compositions from the Works Days and Theogony of Hesiod</hi> (1817). Both the designs and the inscribed texts are fully searchable.<lb/><lb/>
                The thirty-seven Hesiod plates are one of Blake’s major endeavors as a commercial etcher/engraver of designs by other artists. Flaxman began to sketch designs based on Hesiod’s poems in the early 1790s, but it was not until February 1816 that he entered into a contract with Longman &amp; Co. to compose a series of illustrations for publication. Blake had already been commissioned to execute the plates, almost certainly on the recommendation of Flaxman, a friend of many years. The publisher began to receive proof impressions in November 1814; the project was completed by January 1817. Blake, who received very few other engraving commissions during this period, was paid 5 guineas (£5.5s.) for each plate, a total of £194.5s. Without the Hesiod project, Blake and his wife Catherine might have descended into dire poverty.<lb/><lb/>
                Blake executed the Hesiod illustrations in an unusual graphic style. Rather than continuous outlines, found in the engravings of Flaxman’s other classical compositions, Blake used stippled lines—that is, lines composed of dots. It is surprising to see Blake, who wrote in a letter of 1827 that "a Line is a Line in its Minutest Subdivision[s]," deploying a technique that divides lines into points. Perhaps he was responding to the character of Flaxman’s preliminary drawings, now untraced, upon which the etchings/engravings were based. If these were in soft pencil, then stippled lines would be an appropriate equivalent. It is also possible that Flaxman or his publisher directed Blake to use this style.<lb/><lb/>
                Flaxman’s classical compositions were influenced by, and often understood as recreations of, Greek and Etruscan vase paintings. His illustrations of Homer’s <hi rend="i">Iliad</hi> and <hi rend="i">Odyssey</hi> and of Dante’s <hi rend="i">Divine Comedy</hi> were published, or at least engraved, in 1793. They soon became famous and highly influential throughout Europe. These were followed by designs for the tragedies of Aeschylus in 1795 and Blake’s Hesiod engravings in 1817. Blake also contributed three plates to the 1805 revised publication of the <hi rend="i">Iliad</hi> illustrations; these are forthcoming in the Archive.<lb/><lb/>

               facing forward with her head turned to the left and slightly up.  Her right leg is crossed over her left and she props
               her left elbow on her right knee; she may be resting
               her head on her left hand.  She is wearing a tunic, or possibly a gown and a cloak, and a halo of stars encircles her head.
               The tripod prize to be awarded the contest winner sits to the left of her.  At the 
               left side of the design stands Hesiod, facing forward and to the right.  Wearing a tunic with drapery 
               falling to the left, he holds a hammer-like object in his right hand
               and plays a cithara that is strapped to his body.  His left hand is visible through the strings 
               of the cithara, which his fingers appear to be plucking.
               His head is turned to the right, towards the muse, and his mouth is open as if he is singing.
               At the right side of the design stands Homer, facing forward and slightly left.  He also wears
               a tunic, but the folds of drapery leave his upper body exposed.  He holds a hammer-like object
               in his right hand, near the cithara that is strapped to his chest.  His left hand is raised with fingers
               poised as if about to strum the cithara's strings.  His eyes appear either closed or empty to indicate his blindness.
               Vegetation decorates either side of the engraved words below the dais on which the muse sits.  To the
               left are stems of grain with at least six tassels.  To the right is an oak branch 
               with a single fork, bearing leaves and acorns.
               A decorative sheaf of grain stems lies horizontally just above the title, above the muse's head.  
               A pair of wings

               adorn Pandora.  
               Pandora stands in a gently contrapposto position near the middle of the design, facing forward but looking
               left.  Her right arm is extended while her left
               arm is bent, her left hand resting on the shoulder of the Grace to her right.  
               She already wears a gown or tunic that fastens at her shoulders and falls in folds of drapery to her feet; 
               the Graces are depicted in the process of dressing Pandora
               in a cloak or additional layer of fabric.
               One of the Graces stands just to the left of Pandora, facing right and leaning 
               backward slightly, her
               head tilted up and back.  Her right arm is bent
               at her waist, the fingers of her right arm holding the edge of a piece of cloth or a cloak
               under Pandora's right arm.  
               This Grace is nude from the waist up; folds of transparent drapery fall from her waist
               to the floor, wrapping around her legs and feet.  
               Another Grace kneels to the right of Pandora, at her feet.  This Grace faces left and looks
               slightly down.  Her left arm is extended down towards the hem of Pandora's
               gown.  She is nude but for the folds of cloth that wrap her legs.  
               The third Grace stands behind and to the right of the kneeling Grace, bending slightly forward towards
               Pandora, who rests a hand on this Grace's shoulder.  Her arms are bent towards Pandora
               and she is holding the edge of a piece of cloth or cloak under Pandora's left arm, helping
               the leftmost Grade to wrap this cloth around Pandora's back.  
               This Grace is entirely nude; her curly hair is in a bun and she may be wearing a headband.
               On the floor to the left of the leftmost Grace sits an ornamented box with its lid open to reveal
               jewelry chains or strings of beads or jewels spilling out.
               Above and to the left of this box hover the three Hours, facing right.  The leftmost Hour is in 
               front of the others, hovering with knees bent and bent right arm extended towards Pandora, her 
               fingers loosely holding a sprig of vegetation with at least one flower bud.  The middle Hour
               hovers slightly to her right, her right arm extended behind the Hours and her left bent upward,
               her hand at her chest.  She holds a sprig of vegetation, possibly with flowers, in each hand.
               The rightmost Hour is depicted behind and to the right of the other two.  She turns her head to the left
               to look
               away from Pandora and holds her extended arms spread wide, one reaching behind the Hours and
               one before them.  She also holds a sprig of vegetation, perhaps with flowers, in each hand.
               Persuasion stands to the right of the design at a little distance from Pandora
               and the Graces.  She faces left, with her left arm bent around her waist and her right arm
               bent upward, her right hand at her neck.  
               Her hair is pulled back, apparently in 
               a bun, and she wears a headband.  Her bent head is covered with a transparent hood or wrap.
               She wears a cloak wrapped over her shoulders and arms that falls to about
               knee height, revealing a floor-length gown beneath.

                  a gently contrapposto position, with her weight resting on her right leg, her right hip
                  out, and her left leg slightly bent.  The Graces are depicted in the process of dressing Pandora

                  She already wears a gown or tunic that fastens at her shoulders and falls in folds of drapery to her feet; it
                  is open to reveal her left leg from hip to ankle.  Pooling fabric at the floor may be
                  intended to suggest her right foot.

                  at her waist, the fingers of her right arm holding the edge of a piece of cloth or a cloak
                  under Pandora's right arm.  Her left hand, fingers bent and apart, is visible over Pandora's shoulder.
                  This Grace is nude from the waist up, although 
                  Pandora's right arm covers her breasts.  Folds of transparent drapery fall from her waist
                  to the floor, wrapping around her legs and feet.  She stands with her left leg bent slightly.
                  Her hair is short or drawn back.
                  Another Grace kneels to the right of Pandora, at her feet.  This Grace faces left and looks
                  slightly down.  Her right arm is bent at the elbow, which is visible behind her back; she holds
                  her right palm facing toward the viewer.  Her left arm is extended down towards the hem of Pandora's
                  gown.  The fingers of both hands are slightly spread.  She is nude but for the folds of cloth that wrap 
                  her legs.  The muscles of her abdomen
                  are visible in profile.  On the cloth across her lap lies a decorative element, which may be a
                  strand of jewelry, such as a necklace or bracelet.  Her hair is swept back into a bun and wrapped in a band.
                  The third Grace stands behind and to the right of the kneeling Grace, bending slightly forward towards
                  Pandora, who rests a hand on this Grace's shoulder.  Her visible left leg is bent, her foot
                  on tiptoe.  The Grace's arms are bent towards Pandora
                  and she is holding the edge of a piece of cloth or cloak under Pandora's left arm, helping
                  the leftmost Grade to wrap this cloth around Pandora's back.  She is looking down, her head bent.
                  This Grace is entirely nude; her curly hair is in a bun and she may be wearing a headband.
                  All three Graces' feet are bare.  Folds of cloth lie at the feet of the two right Graces.

                     fingers loosely holding a sprig of vegetation with at least one flower bud.  Her bent left elbow
                     is visible behind her back.  She is wearing a semi-transparent gown that wraps over her left
                     shoulder and extends below her feet.  Her left knee and right leg and foot is visible in front of
                     the gown.
                     A ribbon cinches her waist with a bow.
                     The middle Hour
                     hovers slightly to her right, her right arm extended behind the Hours and her left bent upward,
                     her hand at her chest.  She holds a sprig of vegetation, possibly with flowers, in each hand.
                     She wears a gown that fastens at her shoulder and covers her legs and feet completely.
                     The rightmost Hour is depicted behind the other two.  She turns her head to the left to look
                     away from Pandora and holds her extended arms spread wide, one reaching behind the Hours and
                     one before them.  She also holds a sprig of vegetation, perhaps with flowers, in each hand.

                     in a line from the mouth of the open jar.  The ill closest to the mouth of the jar 
                     resembles a skeleton with prominent ribs; it leaps leftward with right leg bent and left leg 
                     and arm extended, its right
                     arm bent and right hand at its head.  Its head is bent back.
                     The ill just above and to the left appears human-like,
                     perhaps male.  Its legs are bent backward and its visible bent left arm held close at its side.
                     Facing left, it bends forward and thrusts its chin forward, head bent back.  
                     The ill just above looks human-like,
                     perhaps female.  Its arms are spread and raised at 135 degrees; its right leg is bent double
                     and its left extended.  With body facing forward, it turns its head to look right, mouth open.
                     A fourth ill, facing left, appears behind this female ill, with one forearm and hand showing 
                     to the right of her waist, and head and shoulders showing to the left.
                     A fifth ill, bald, appears in downward-facing flight between Epimetheus' legs.  Stretched long
                     as if in a line from top right corner to bottom left,
                     this ill flies left and down.  It holds its right arm extended vertically (relative to its body) and its left arm bent 
                     and drawn back.  Its head is bent back and up.
                     One leg is extended behind it and the other is bent up towards its chest.  Of indeterminate gender, 
                     this ill is probably a human-like male.
                     A sixth ill in horizontal flight appears to the left of Epimetheus' right arm.  Its arms are 
                     extended and spread wide at about 135 degrees, its right hand holding a scroll-like object, or perhaps a spear or bone, and its
                     left arm disappearing after the elbow.  This ill's thin limbs, knobby left shoulder, and
                     facial features suggest a skeleton.  It is bald.
                     Though it appears to be flying left, its head is turned to look right.  All of the ills are nude.
                     Lines above the female ill's forehead suggest hair, while the other three in this line are

               with right legs bent and drawn up, left legs extended.  Each wields a long-handled spear.  A third
               rightward facing man crouches or lunges near the left edge of the design, his torso facing forward,
               his left arm raised and holding a shield.  A fallen soldier lies limply over a mound or rock, his legs
               bent and his left arm extended over his head.  Three leftward-facing lions lunge into the scene from the right side
               of the design.  Above them coil two snakes.

               Justice stands or hovers behind and above her, closer to Zeus.  She leans backward, facing 
               away from the viewer and slightly to the left, and tilts her head back
               to look upward.  Her bent left arm is at her side, open hand in front of her chest with palm out, fingers slightly spread.
               Her right arm is extended behind her, with her right hand grasping a downward-facing jar or vial 
               out of which liquid pours.
               Justice's curly hair is styled in a ponytail.  She is wearing a long gown, tied at the waist with a belt; her
               feet are not visible.

A female Fury, or Erinyes to the Greeks,
                        stands or strides leftward 
               at the center of the design,
               with arms spread wide.  She holds a snake in her outstretched left hand and a smoking torch with visible 
               flames in her right.
               A second Fury stands or strides leftward near the left edge of the design, though she turns her head to look
               to the right.  She brandishes a torch with flames and smoke in her upraised right hand and a snake in her left.
               Both Furies wear snake ornaments at their foreheads, above their wild hair.  Between the Furies, towards the left
               of the design, two nude muscular men struggle in combat.  One lies on the ground in a supine position 
               at the feet
               of the other, who stands above him.  The standing man uses one arm to hold his enemy down by the neck 
               while he draws
               his other arm backwards, clasping a dagger.  The man on the ground is propped rigidly on buttocks and left elbow,
               straining as he reaches upward with his extended right arm to hold the chin of his combatant.  
               To the right of the central
               Fury, a third nude man leans forward and drags two women, or a woman and a child, rightward.  He faces right and away
               from the viewer: his torso faces right and slightly forward, but his head is turned away and seen in partial profile.
               The female on the right, clearly adult, kneels or crawls forward on her knees, facing right and away but turning her
               head so that her face is visible in two-thirds profile.  She embraces the female child(?) on the left with her extended
               left arm.  The child wraps her own bent right arm around the woman's extended left arm, and leans her head forward
               to rest her forehead on it.  The man grasps the child's partially undone hair at the nape of her neck and holds the
               woman's right hand as he pulls them away.  At the right edge of the design sits or crouches a bearded old man dressed
               in a tunic, with at least one knee bent and drawn up and his head bent down low.  His right arm is at his side,
               slightly bent, with the knuckles resting on the ground, while the fingers of his left hand touch his forehead.
               Flames appear near the upper right corner of the design, and billowing smoke fills the corner.

               body nearly horizontal.  She bends backwards slightly at the waist, but looks down with downcast eyes.  Her right arm
               is extended horizontally behind her, and she holds her scales with this hand.  She holds her bent left arm in front
               of her, with her left hand at her forehead.  She is wearing a long gown and a cloak.  A female spirit hovers or flies leftward
               to the left of Justice.  Her bent right arm is out in front of her; her left arm is straight by her side.  Each hand
               holds a downward-facing jar or vial from which she pours streams of liquid representing "famine and pestilence" (see the 
               engraved text below the design).  She
               has long hair and wears a sleeveless belted gown.  A personification of Zeus's "wrath" hovers or flies leftward near
               the upper right corner of the design.  This androgynous figure has its head up and its face turned away from the viewer,
               visible only slightly.  The figure has long hair streaming behind its back, and hovers or flies with its straight
               left arm extended horizontally behind it and its bent right arm held out horizontally in front of its face, elbow forward.
               The figure is enveloped in a billowing cloak.
               A man lies on his back on the ground at the lower right corner of the design, his head near the corner.
               With head bent back, mouth open, and eyes closed, he may be dying or dead (the engraved caption below the design 
               reads in part, "in heaps they die").  Another, younger man sprawls backwards near the bottom of the design.  
               He seems to be resting on his right
               knee and toes, left heel, and right arm, though the woman to the left may be helping to prop him up with her 
               shoulder and knee.  His torso faces forward and up; his head is back and his face looks up to the 
               sky.  His mouth is open; he may be dead or dying (see engraved caption).  He has short hair and is 
               nude except for a fold of cloth draped between his legs.  A woman kneels facing forward to the left of this man.  She is 
               bending forward so far that the tops of her shoulders are facing out towards the viewer.  She is wearing a sleeveless gown with
               buttons or clasps visible over her right shoulder.  Her left knee, bent upward,
               seems to be partially supporting the upper left arm of the man 
               sprawling to the right.  Her head is down, perhaps
               resting on top of this same man's  upper arm, and her face is not visible.  Her hair is gathered into a bun at the nape
               of her neck.  Just to the right of the man sprawling backwards, a woman lies embracing him.  Kneeling, her body faces
               left and rests against his left side.  Her visible left eye is open, but the pinprick pupil gives the impression that it
               stares blankly.  Her loose-limbed, limp position suggests that she may be dead or dying (see the engraved caption).  Two
               additional figures are partially visible lying near the bottom left corner of the design.  The head of one appears lying
               in the corner, tilted back and up so that the face is shown upside-down, eyes closed.  The second figure is lying in a supine position a little above
               the head in the corner, with head near the edge of the design and body extending rightward at a downward sloping angle.
               This figure's eyes are closed
               and mouth open.  Both figures may be dead
               or dying (again, see the engraved caption).

                  The shape of her skirt suggests that her left knee is bent

The central group consists of a man and 
               a woman kneeling and facing one another.  Each adult has a child on his or her lap; the children embrace and kiss
               one another.  At the right side of the design stands or sits a man facing left and playing Pan pipes.  He is resting
               against, and perhaps sitting in, a crook of the grapevine to the right.  Just to the left of the musician, a woman
               kneels nursing a child at her knees.  She faces left but bends forward in a somewhat hunched position, her head down.
               Her short-haired child faces away from the viewer, half standing with knees slightly bent, and half resting against his or her
               mother's legs.  The child twists towards the mother to suckle.  Another family grouping, including a man, a woman,
               and two or perhaps three children, sits at the left side 
               of the design near the lower corner.  The man sits cross-legged facing forward, though his left leg may be bent
               with knee raised upward.  His right arm is wrapped around a standing child to his left, and his left hand appears
               at the back of a child sitting on his lap.  The standing child faces right, with left leg slightly in front of 
               its right leg, and visible right arm bent upward.  Its hand is at its mouth.  The other child sits on the man's lap
               with its body facing left; it turns its head to look out toward the viewer.  The woman sits to the right of the man,
               facing away from the viewer but leaning slightly left and turning her head to look down and left towards the children,
               so that her face is visible in partial profile, seen from behind.  She lightly embraces the child sitting on the man's lap,
               her left arm raised and bent around this child's upper body.  A round shape visible on her lap may be the head of a third
               child.  All of the children are nude, as is the man in the central grouping and the woman at the right.  The other adults 
               are partially clothed in fabric wrapped around their lower bodies.  Three female spirits hover above the family groupings.  
               Each faces left but twists rightward so that her head 
               looks right.  The spirit hovering over the family group sitting at the left side of the design extends her left arm
               out behind her at 45 degrees, loosely holding a cluster of grapes in this hand. She holds her bent right arm across her torso, 
               close to her body. 
               The middle female spirit hovers above and to the left of the family group sitting in the middle of the design.
               She holds her slightly bent right arm extended out in front of her at about 135 degrees.  Her bent left arm is drawn back 
               and raised so that her hand is at head level.  She holds flowers or leaves in both hands.  The third female spirit hovers
               above the kneeling woman at the right side of the design.  Her chin is tilted
               slightly up and she seems to be gazing upward.  Her left arm is drawn back and extended behind her, and she is loosely
               holding a flower and some grapes in this hand.  She holds her right arm, slightly bent, extended horizontally out
               in front of her. All three spirits wear long gowns or skirts and shirts.
               A large grape vine rooted in the
               lower right corner grows up the right side of the design, where it supports the musician, and then curves leftward,
               extending across the top of the design.  It sprouts large leaves and grape clusters, as well as flowers(?) and curling
               branches, filling up the spaces left between the figures.  Sheaves of wheat lying on the ground appear between

               each with a child on their laps.  
               The adults' bent knees may be touching. The man is crouching on his toes, while
               the woman rests on her right toes with her left foot flat on the ground.  The man, slumping slightly,
               looks down with head
               bent towards the baby sitting on his lap.  His visible bent right arm is at his side and he holds the child around
               the belly with his right hand.  His left hand rests on the child's left shoulder.  The child on his lap sits
               facing right, its slightly bent right leg dangling over the man's right leg.  The child leans slightly forward
               and kisses the child sitting on the woman's lap.  Its right arm is bent and its hand holds the elbow of this other
               child, who sits facing left and hunches slightly, extending its own bent left arm to touch the rightward facing child's head.
               The woman holds the leftward facing child sitting on her lap, with her bent left arm under the child's arm.
               Her right arm is raised in front of her torso with her palm facing outward.
               The man and both children are nude and have short hair.  The woman's hair is drawn back into a bun; she is nude
               except for a cloak or cloth wrapped around her lower body.

               to the right.  His left leg may be bent with knee raised upward.  
               He looks out toward the viewer.  His right arm is wrapped around a standing child to his left,
               and his left hand appears at the back of the child sitting on his lap.  He has short hair, and appears
               to be nude except for a tunic or cloth wrapped around his lower body.  The standing child is nude and has short
               hair, and may be male or female.  This child faces right, with
               its left leg slightly in front of its right, and its visible right arm bent upward.  The child's right hand is at 
               its mouth.  The other child sits on the man's lap with its body facing left; it too is nude and has short hair, with
               no gender identifications.  It turns its head to look out toward the viewer.  Its legs are bent and the fingers
               of its right hand rest on the forearm of the woman who sits to the right of the man.  
               This woman faces away from the viewer, but leans slightly left and turns
               her head to look down and left towards the children, so that her face is visible in partial profile, seen from
               behind.  Her legs extend away from the viewer but may be bent.  She lightly embraces the child
               sitting on the man's lap, her left arm raised and bent around this child's upper body.  Her left hand may be resting on
               this sitting child's right shoulder, and her chin may be resting against the child's head.  
               Her right arm is bent at her side, and may be lying on her lap.  She
               is nude except for a cloak or other cloth wrapped around her waist and covering her lower body.  Her hair is drawn
               up into a bun.  A round shape visible on her lap may be the head of a third child.

               an arc within a belt of stars, which may also be intended to represent the Pleiades in constellation form.
               Thirteen stars appear below the daughters, in the lower left corner of the design.  Twenty-two more stars
               appear to the right of the uppermost Pleiades, completing the belt.
               The lowermost Pleiad faces away from the viewer and hides her face; she may be Merope, who is ashamed to show her face
               because she married a mortal.  Although she is rising with her sisters, her bent right leg is etended and her
               right foot is still flat on the ground (or at least on the lower border of the design).  Her left leg is bent and drawn 
               upward so that the bottom of her left foot is
               visible.  Her right arm is bent upwards at her side, with her hand at her right shoulder.  Her bent left arm is raised
               at 135 degrees.  She may be leaning against the leg of the Pleiad just above her, and resting
               her upper arm on this Pleiad's upper thigh or embracing her.  Her hair is wrapped in two headbands and drawn into a bun at the back
               of her head.  The Pleiad just above and to the left of Merope faces forward
               and to the right.  Her head is tilted back and to the right and she seems to be looking upwards.  Her right arm is at her 
               side, bent slightly, and she touches Merope's back with the fingers of this hand.  Her left hand rests on the shoulder of the 
               figure just above her.  Although her lower body is swathed
               in drapery, her right leg is visible beneath the folds, embracing Merope's upper body.  
               Her hair is drawn back to the base of her neck, where
               short pieces escape from her coiffure.  The third Pleiad from the bottom faces forward and to the right, but
               bends her head down and to the left.  She stretches her slightly bent right arm across her body; the Pleiad 
               to the right is holding her hand.  Her left arm and lower body are mostly not visible, although the thighs
               of her bent legs, swathed in fabric, appear to the left of the arm of the Pleiad to the left.  Her sleek
               head and the braid or twist above her left ear suggests that her hair is pulled back.  Near the top of the arc of
               the Pleiades, directly above Merope, one of the sisters rises in a supine position, her body nearly horizontal.  Her
               lower body, visible from knee to waist, faces up, but she twists to her right at the waist so that her torso faces 
               away from the viewer.  She turns her head even further to the right to look down, so that the right side of her face
               is visible in partial profile.  Her left arm, slightly bent, is at her side, with fingers spread.  Her right arm, bent upward, 
               is drawn slightly back and this hand is at her shoulder.  Her hair is drawn back into a bun-like
               coiffure and she wears a headband.  Just to the right of this sister are two more sisters who seem to be supine.
               The uppermost one faces up, with upraised eyes.  Only her face, and possibly one hand, are visible.
               The lower one turns her head to look down towards the ground.  Her shoulder is visible to the right of the Pleiad
               to her left.  Her sleek head and the braid or twist above her right ear suggest that her hair is drawn back.  To 
               the left of these sisters is another whose body (visible only from the waist up) is nearly horizontal.  She faces forward
               but turns her head slightly to her right, up towards the top of the design.  Her right arm is bent upward at her side,
               and her hand, which is in front of her breast, is holding the hand of the Pleiad to the left.  Her left arm may be extended, 
               with her left hand holding the hand of one of the sisters to the right.  Like several of her
               sisters, her sleek head and
               the braid or twist above her left ear suggest that her hair is drawn back.  Her mouth is partly open.  All
               of the Pleiades are nude except for drapery that swaths their lower bodies, connecting the sisters.  Two reapers
               harvest grain near the bottom right corner of the design.  Dressed in minimal clothing, they 
               face to the right and away from the viewer, bending
               to wield their sickles.  Thickly tasseled, the grain rises densely from the right edge
               and grows two-thirds of the way across the bottom of the design.

                  Her left leg is bent and drawn up so that the bottom of her left foot is visible.  Her right arm is bent upwards at
                  her side, with her hand at her right shoulder.  Her bent left arm is raised and her elbow points left at 135 degrees.
                  She may be leaning against the leg of the Pleiad just above her, and resting her upper arm on this Pleiad's
                  upper thigh or embracing her waist.  She turns her head to the left so that her face is very slightly visible in profile,

                  two headbands and drawn into a bun at the back of her head.  She is nude except for folds of cloth that drape
                  over all the sisters, falling over Merope's lower body and wrapping around each leg.

               spring nighttime sky in an arc within a belt of stars, which may also be intended to represent the 
               Pleiades in constellation form.  A large grouping of stars appear around the lower left edge of the arc 
               formed by the Pleiades' bodies.  A second grouping appears to the right of the Pleiades, in the upper right
               corner, completing the belt. The leftmost Pleiad is the last sister in the arc, positioned in the upper left
               corner of the design.  Her body is in a prone, nearly horizontal position.  
               She extends her left arm out 
               in front of her, past her head, and rests it along the upper right arm of the Pleiad to the right.  Her right arm is bent
               upward and close to her side.  She wears an ornament of flowers above her forehead, and her hair is drawn back
               into a ponytail or bun behind her head.  The Pleiad second from the left is prone, her body nearly horizontal.  
               Her head is tilted back and her face is turned away.  Her right arm is at her side,
               slightly bent.  Her left arm is not visible, but her left hand is resting on the shoulder of the Pleiad to the right
               of her.  Her lower body is mostly hidden, but at least one bent knee, wrapped in cloth, is shown beneath the leg
               of the Pleiad below.  Her hair is drawn back into a bun.  The rightmost Pleiad in the top group of three is mostly 
               hidden by her sisters.
               Her head is visible, turned up to look towards the top of the design.  Her hair may be short, or it may be drawn back
               behind her head.  One hand (probably the left) appears to the right of the arm of the Pleiad obscuring the rest of her body.  
               In this hand she may be holding a small object, possibly a flower.  Part of her
               lower body -- perhaps a bent knee, facing downward -- is visible beneath the thighs of the same Pleiad in front of her.
               The curving body of the only Pleiad seen almost entirely in full extends from the top of the arc formed by the Pleiades
               in the upper left corner (her right foot) around to the lower right side of the arc (her hand and arm).  She is swathed in
               cloth from the waist down, but otherwise nude with visible breasts.  Her lower body faces down, but she twists at the waist
               so that her upside down upper body faces out towards the viewer, and turns her head to look left so that her face is shown
               in profile.  Her left arm is extended upward and bent over her head, and she holds a fold of the cloth that drapes around
               the arc of the Pleiades with three or four fingers of this hand.  Her right forearm is shown bent upward, and her right
               hand is at her face: her chin may be resting on this hand.  Her right leg is extended and slightly bent, the toes pointed,
               while her left leg is not shown.  The cloth wrapping around her lower body and leg leaves her right foot exposed.
               Her eyes are down or closed, and her hair is drawn into a bun.  The lowermost Pleiad faces away from the viewer.  Her
               body, which is visible from the buttocks up, stretches mostly horizontally across the bottom of the arc.  Her left arm 
               is bent and raised over her head, and she rests her head on this forearm.  She looks away and her face is hidden.  
               Her hair is short or may be
               drawn around over her right shoulder.  At the bottom of the arc formed by the Pleiades' bodies, the leftmost sister is visible
               from the neck up.  She bends her head up and back to look diagonally left.  Her right arm is bent and wrapped around
               the top of her head.  This hand is in her hair, which is long and loose and billows behind her.  Just above the lowermost
               Pleiad, who faces away from the viewer, is another in a prone position who lifts her head so that her face is depicted
               in profile, looking down and to the left.  Only her head and upper back, nude, are visible.  Her hair is drawn back into
               a twist or bun.  All of the Pleiades are nude except for fabric that drapes their lower bodies and connects them through
               the arch.
               Near the lower right corner of the design a man plows a field with two oxen.  The man walks right, his bent left leg in
               front of his right.  He looks right and leans
               slightly forward.  He has short hair, and lines in front of his torso suggest clothing.  The oxen wear a yoke and pull
               the plow, its blade between them.

                        forward on his plow.
               His left leg is in front of his right.  His arms are crossed and resting on his plow.
               His left hand holds the cloak or cloth that wraps around his torso and buttocks; part of this cloth drapes
               over his plow and falls in folds towards the floor.  He has short hair and is nude except for the cloth.
               Two oxen lie on the ground near the feet of the farmer.  The one nearest the left corner of the design lies
               facing forward and to the right.  Its head is up and turned forward and to the left.  The second one is 
               seen in profile and lies facing right, its head resting on the ground.  At the lower right corner of the design
               is an altar, shown as a large pillar-like block on a step or plinth.  A fire atop the altar billows smoke upward and to the right.
               A flock of seven birds rises upward from above the altar towards the upper right corner.  They may be intended
               to represent a good augury.  In the upper left corner, Zeus sits facing right with a goddess (perhaps Hera)
               before him.  He holds his staff in his right hand, and raises his bent left arm to embrace
               the goddess.  He has long curly hair and a beard,
               and is dressed in robes or a cloak with a stripe decorating the hem.  The goddess faces forward and to the left,
               leaning her folded arms on Zeus's lap.  Her right arm is bent upward, and her right hand is under her chin.  
               She is wrapped in a cloak or other fabric with a stripe decorating the hem, which winds around her right arm and
               over each shoulder.  Her lower body is hidden. The scales of Justice hang over the head of the goddess.
               Apollo sits facing left in the upper right corner of the design.  He is seated on a folded cloth or cloak,
               with a decorative vine-lined hem, that drapes down from his seat (not pictured).  Both legs are bent and his
               right leg is crossed over his left.  He leans slightly on his cithara, which is tucked under his right arm.
               His right hand is visible resting on top of the cithara, near his chin.  His head is down slightly and he may be
               resting his chin on this hand.  His left arm is down, but bent and drawn back slightly, and his hand is
               touching or holding a fold of the cloth mentioned above.  He is nude except for his
               sandals, and has curly short hair or longer hair pulled back behind his head.

               He is reclining against the legs of the muse sitting above him, and wearing a tunic or other cloth that wraps around
               his pelvis and thighs and drapes over his left arm.  His legs are stretched out to the right and his slightly
               bent left leg is crossed over his right.  His staff, possibly a shepherd's crook, is propped between his legs and 
               resting on his left shoulder.
               Both hands rest on this staff.  The muse
               above him leans over him.  She sits facing right, but turns her torso away from the viewer, leaning forward with
               her head down and her right elbow resting on her lap.  She holds her right lower arm up, gesticulating with
               her first finger pointed.  Her left arm is bent and drawn back, shown from shoulder to lower forearm.  The bottom
               of a lyre or cithara is pictured to the left of her lower back, as if it rests against her left hip.  She is dressed
               in a long gown, belted at the waist.  A cloak or other cloth wraps loosely around her pelvis.  The toes of 
               her bare right foot are visible beneath the hem of her gown.  Her hair is drawn back into a bun and a band
               wraps twice around her head.  A dog sits near Hesiod's feet, in the lower right corner of the design.
               Its body faces right, but it turns its head to look left.  Two sheep and one ram graze in the background
               on the right side of the design, facing left above the dog.  
               Two altars to Zeus flank the scene.  A bowl atop a tripod with each leg composed of two crisscrossed members surmounts 
               the altar on the left.
               A single line in an arc (broken by the top edge of the design) separates the scene from simple cosmological
               elements appearing in the upper corners.  In the upper left corner, a rising or setting sun emitting beams of light
               peeks over the edge of the arc.  A crescent moon appears in the upper right corner.

At the right side of the design, one of the muses steps forward
               to present Hesiod with a leafy laurel bough, emblem of victory.  Facing right, she is seen in profile walking
               with her straight right leg forward.  She is wearing a long gown, belted at the waist, with
               a cloak over her right shoulder.  Her hair is drawn back into a ponytail.  Hesiod faces left, leaning, half-sitting,
               against a support (pictured at most by a line right of his left fist) with his right leg crossed over his left, 
               facing left and bending slightly
               forward.  His straight left arm is at his side.  His left hand, in a fist, is resting
               on the support near his buttocks.  He holds his right forearm out horizontally and loosely holds the
               end of the laurel bough between his palm and thumb, with his first two fingers extended as if pointing.
               He is wearing a short cloak, draped over his left shoulder and falling to rest on his upper thighs.  His hair
               is short and slightly curly, and he is nude except for the cloak.  One of the muses sits facing forward
               at the right side of the design, to the right of Hesiod.  Her legs are bent and her left leg is crossed over her 
               right.  She turns her torso slightly to the left and her right arm is bent upward.
               Her head is bent and turned left, and she may be resting her head on her right hand.  She holds a cane or
               staff shaped like a shepherd's crook across her lap.
               She is wearing a long gown, belted at the waist with
               a band and attached or decorated at the left shoulder with three visible buttons.  Her hair is drawn back
               into a low bun and her head is circled with a crown of leaves.  A cloak or other form of cloth drapes
               across her lap, on the opposite diagonal from the cane.
               Another muse sits above and to the right of Hesiod, where she is partly hidden by the muse below.  The higher
               muse faces right and slightly forward, but turns her head to look forward and to the left.  
               She is wearing a shirt or gown with long sleeves and a keyhole neckline.  Her hair
               is drawn back over her ears, and she may be wearing a wide headband or other head covering.  Her lower body is
               mostly hidden by Hesiod's shoulder and the other muse.  Just to the left of the muse handing the laurel bough
               to Hesiod stand two other muses shoulder to shoulder.  The muse on the left faces right, wrapped in a cloak that
               covers her body from neck to mid-calf and falls in folds of drapery behind her.  
               The muse to the right faces right and slightly forward.  She looks
               forward and to the right, her face shown in three-quarters profile.  The fingers of her right hand are visible on 
               the shoulder of the muse standing to the left.  A cithara is half-visible to the right of the muse's skirt
               where her knee would be.  She is wearing a loosely-belted gown and a cloak over her upper body.  
               The hair of both muses is drawn back. 
               A sixth muse sits facing right and seen in profile at the left side of the design.  She leans forward and hunches
               slightly, holding a scepter or rod and with a cithara behind it.  Her visible right leg is bent and her right foot 
               rests flat on the floor.
               She is wearing a skirt or gown that falls to the floor and covers half her right foot.  Over
               this she wears a gown or long tunic that falls down from her shoulder to cover much of her right arm and is 
               belted at the waist.  Her hair is arranged in an elaborate coiffure that includes one or two buns.
               Above the cithara sits a seventh muse with her lower body facing left.  She twists to turn her torso forward and
               her head to the right.  Her head is slightly bent, and her hair drawn 
               back into a bun at the back of her head.  Her right arm is bent at her side and her forearm lies on her lap.
               Her right hand is holding an open book that is also resting on her lap.  Her left arm is bent and her elbow may
               be resting on a hidden support.  Her forearm is bent upward and her left hand is at her chin, which may
               be resting on this hand.  She is wearing a sleeveless gown and has a cloak or other cloth
               draped over her lower right arm.  In the upper left corner a muse kneels at the feet of her sister,
               leaning on her lap.  Her lower body faces left, but she twists her torso forward and to the right.  Her
               right arm is at her side, bent upward, and her right hand is in a fist resting on her sister's knee.  Her left
               arm is bent and raised so that her forearm rests horizontally along her sister's thigh.  She holds her
               right wrist with her left hand.  Her legs are bent and tucked underneath her.  Her head is bent and the braid
               or twist over her right ear suggests that her hair is long and pulled back behind her head.  She is wearing
               a long gown with buttons on the right shoulder.  To the left sits another muse who faces left and sits leaning
               on a sculpted bust of Zeus, the father of all nine of the muses.  Her lower body faces left and slightly forward,
               but she turns her head to look forward and to the right.  Her legs are bent and the bust of Zeus rests 
               on her lap.  The bust, with a beard and long hair, faces forward and to the left.  It may be wearing a helmet
               or hat.  The muse's left arm is at her side, bent upward, and her left hand rests on the top of the bust.
               She is wearing a sleeveless gown.  Her hair is drawn back behind her ears and held with a headband, and braids or
               curls hang down on either side of her face.

                  her forearm out horizontally and her
                  hand holding the bough with open fingers.  Her left forearm is held up in front of her and she

               left arm is bent upward.  Her right forearm is raised vertically and her right hand 
               is at her mouth, with the first two fingers extended and the next two loosely closed.
               Her head is bent and turned left so that her face is seen in profile, and she may be resting her head on her right hand.
               A cane or staff shaped like a shepherd's crook lies diagonally across her lap, propped against her upper left arm, with its curved
               handle up.  Her left arm is bent and extended across her lap parallel to the cane, and she loosely
               holds it near the bottom with her left hand, her first two fingers lying extended along its shaft.
               She is wearing a long gown, belted at the waist with a band and attached or decorated at the left shoulder with three
               visible buttons.  Her hair is drawn back into a low bun and her head is circled with a crown of leaves.
               Her feet seem encased in some form of covering, perhaps simple shoes.  A cloak or other cloth drapes
               across her lap, on the opposite diagonal from the cane.  Lines beneath her left foot may represent the ground.

               Jupiter sits on the throne at the far right side of the design, facing forward and to the left.  He rests 
               his right foot on a decorative footstool, and leans forward to rest his chin on his right hand, with his
               right elbow propped on the arm of his throne.  He holds at least three stylized lightning bolts, represented

               of the design, two near the middle facing away from the viewer and holding a lyre (left) and a cithara (right).  
               Two other muses face forward and to the

               sitting next to Jupiter's throne and facing left, holds her mouth open as if she is singing.  All of the muses

                  faces forward, but Jupiter turns diagonally left so that his body faces forward and left.  He turns his
                  head even further to the left, so that his face is seen in profile.  Both of his legs are bent, and his right
                  foot rests on a footstool, which lifts his right knee higher than his left.  His right arm is bent upward
                  at his side, elbow resting on his right knee and right hand at his chin with the first two fingers extended.
                  He leans forward and to the left to rest his chin on this hand, his head down.  His left arm is bent,
                  elbow out from his body,
                  and his forearm is resting along the arm of his throne.  At least three stylized lightning bolts, depicted
                  as long rods with tapered ends, are propped in the crook of his left elbow with their ends resting in 
                  his lap.  He grasps them with his left hand, holding them between forefinger and the rest of his fingers.
                  He wears a band around his head and a cloak or other cloth draped over his lap and wrapped
                  around his left forearm, from where it falls in folds of drapery to the floor.  His feet are encased

               Her hair is drawn back into a bun, and an elaborate decorative net covers the bun and much of her head.

               A large cithara sits before her (partly hidden by her body), and a strap circling her back from

            his breasts, and his large wings crossed over his pelvis.  Beams of light surround him in a triangle shape.
            The rightmost figure lying below his feet is Chaos, who lies on his side facing left.  He embraces his offspring

            water.  She floats reclined, facing left but lying down nearly horizontally.  She is nude and her
            long wavy hair hangs down her back.  Her left arm lies along her body; her right hand (fingers spread) is raised to touch her

            position.  This dolphin's coiled tail may be the spiral-like object rising above the waves near the right

            to the other, like a banner billowing in wind.  The rightmost putto hovers or flies facing forward and to the

            lacks visible wings.  The putto on the left faces forward and to the right, but his body is tilted so that
            it aligns diagonally from upper right to lower left corner of the design.  He holds the banner near its midpoint
            and in the middle of the loop it makes behind his back.  He has feathered wings.  Both putti are nude.
            The nude shoulders and arms of a Triton are shown near the lower left corner of the design: his arms are crossed
            and resting on the head of a second dolphin.  His tail rises from the water to his right, just above Venus'

               His right arm is hidden by the folds of fabric, but a pucker in the cloth to the left of his head suggests
               his handhold.  He tilts his head back to look up and to the left, and his mouth is open slightly.  His legs are 
               spread wide: his right leg is bent and drawn up so that his right foot touches his buttock, 
               and his left leg is extended behind him.  He has short
               hair, but unlike the other putto, he lacks visible wings.  He is nude, and his
               genitals are visible.  The cloth flies behind him and its right end flaps to his right.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="AC"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>putto</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent</characteristic><characteristic>arms bent</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>arms bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>arm extended</characteristic><characteristic>arms extended</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised</characteristic><characteristic>arms raised</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised at 135 degrees</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised vertically</characteristic><characteristic>carrying</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing down</characteristic><characteristic>flying</characteristic><characteristic>hovering</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent at knee</characteristic><characteristic>leg extended</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>short hair</characteristic><characteristic>wing</characteristic><characteristic>feather</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Two putti help to escort Venus as the waves bear her to Cythera.

            She kneels facing forward but tilting her head back slightly and turning it to look up and
            to the right.  Her right leg is bent and she rests on this knee, while her left leg is bent
            with the knee drawn up and her left foot flat on the wave.  Her arms are bent and crossed over
            her torso.  Two Tritons welcome her.  The one to the right emerges from the water turned
            to the left and slightly away from the viewer, with his left arm bent and held slightly away
            and forward.  His tail breaks the water to the right, curling away from the viewer before ending
            in flukes pointing up and to the left.  The upper body of the one to the left emerges from
            the water bent forward towards the right.  He extends both arms out horizontally towards Venus'
            feet, bending his head back to look up to the right.  His tail rises from the water to the left,
            coiling up and back down into the water before emerging again at the left side of the design.
            Two putti also escort Venus.  The one to the left flies or hovers facing right, with both arms
            extended out horizontally towards Venus.  His legs are bent and drawn up behind him.  The putto

            Venus.  His slightly bent left leg is extended, and his lower right leg is visible, bent
            back and drawn up slightly, to the right of his upper left thigh.
            Both putti are nude with short hair, and have feathered wings.  Light, wavy lines left and right of Venus, 
            extending to the left margin on the left, suggest the "foam" bearing her (see the engraved words below the image).

            to Zeus and Hera.  Nude except for a cloak or cloth that wraps around her lower body, she
            stands facing left with her visible left leg bent slightly forward and her left foot on tiptoe.  Her arms are 
            at her side, with her left hand
            holding his left hand.  The child stands or hovers with at least one foot resting on tiptoe in Venus' right
            palm, which is visible to the left of her pelvis.  He leans forward slightly and extends his bent
            right arm; this hand is held in the fingers of Zeus's own had.  The child is nude and has visible genitals,
            short hair, and feathered wings.  Zeus stands to the left of Venus, facing right and slightly
            away from the viewer.  He is dressed in a large cloak that drapes over his right shoulder and arm and
            hides much of his body.  He stands with his feet wide apart and holds his right hand up to hold
            the hand of the winged personification of love.  His left arm is bent and drawn back behind him, and he
            holds a staff or rod with this hand.  He has long hair and his head is circled by a thin band.  Hera
            stands to his left at the left side of the design, facing right and wearing her royal finery, which
            includes a belted gown, a tasseled and decorated cloak, and a tiara or crown possibly surmounted with gems or pearls.  
            Her right forearm
            is bent up and her right hand rests in the crook of Zeus's left elbow.  His staff may be partly
            resting against her arm.  The three Graces stand embracing one another in their traditional circular 
            arrangement near the right side of the design.  One, standing in the middle, faces away from the
            viewer but turns her head to look left.  The Grace to her right faces forward but turns her head
            down and to the left.  The third Grace, to the right, looks forward and to the left.  All three Graces
            are nude from the waist up, and draped in cloaks or other cloths from the waist down, with their
            hair in buns.  Three zodiacal constellations (left to right, Gemini, Leo, and Virgo) and
            other stars indicate the heavenly setting.  Gemini is represented as a dotted line outline of two
            heads in the lower left corner.  Virgo appears near the upper right corner as the dotted line
            outline of the head and upraised arms of a woman.  The dotted line outline of a lion's paw and head
            facing left with mouth open, representing Leo, is visible to the left of Venus' legs.

                  in profile from behind.  Her right arm is bent and raised so that she can rest her right hand on 
                  the shoulder of another Grace standing before her and to the right.  
                  She holds her left arm slightly out from her side, bent with forearm
                  extended horizontally; her left hand rests on the hip of the Grace standing before her and 
                  to the left.  She is nude from the waist up, with a cloak or cloth draped around her waist
                  and hiding her lower body entirely except for her lower right leg, which is 
                  visible from the knee down with
                  her right foot on tiptoe.  This cloth also wraps around her left arm and falls in folds of drapery
                  towards the floor on her right after it circles her waist.  Her hair is drawn back into a bun.
                  The Grace to the left faces forward in contrapposto, though she turns her head down and to the left
                  so that her face is seen in profile.  She holds her right arm bent upward and held forward so that
                  her right hand can rest on the shoulder of the Grace to the right.  This arm may be resting
                  on the left arm of the middle Grace.  Her lower body is entirely
                  swathed in cloth, but the folds of the drapery suggest that her weight is on her right leg, with
                  her left knee bent forward.  She is nude from the waist up and her right breast is outlined.
                  Her hair is drawn back into a bun at the crown of her head.
                  The third Grace, farthest right, is visible mostly as a head and arm, though the bottom of her skirts
                  appear to the right of the middle Grace's right leg.  She holds her left arm bent and out from
                  her side, embracing the middle Grace with her hand resting on this Grace's buttocks.  Her
                  head is turned to look forward and slightly left, and her hair seems to be drawn up into a bun
                  or similar coiffure above the crown of her head.  Folds of drapery just below her elbow suggest

               side of Nereus and Doris, who embrace at the center.  Doris (mother of the Nereids) faces left, her right arm twisted
            gently behind her back and her tail coiling up out of the water and to the left.  She leans forward slightly,
            into Nereus, and her mouth is open.  Her long hair is loose and down.  Nereus faces forward, with
            his bent right arm out slightly form his side and his forearm lying on a coil of his tail.  An oar is propped against his 
            tail and right shoulder.  He turns his head to the right, bending it slightly.  His
            tail coils up out of the water in front of him, bending left before ending in another upward coil. Another
            segment of it appears to the left of his lower torso.  He has a long beard and long hair, surmounted by
            a horned ornament above his forehead.  Two Nereids embrace to the left of Nereus, one facing away and reclined
            rightwards, floating on top of the water, the other facing forward and visible from the shoulders up.  A
            Nereid sits facing right at the left edge of the design.  Her head is down and she may be reclining slightly.
            She may have her left elbow propped on a wave behind her back; she holds her bent right arm slightly extended
            and grasps the end of a cloth that flies like a banner over her head with this hand.  The Nereid to the right
            reclines facing forward and to the left, sitting on top of the waves with her bent legs extended to the left
            and slightly forward.  They are propped on a dolphin whose head breaks the waves beneath her knees.  She
            is leaning back with her head bent slightly forward.  Her left hand rests on the shoulder of the Nereid 
            to the right, and her slightly bent right arm is extended horizontally to the left.  With her left hand she 
            holds one end of the same cloth or banner.  Another Nereid is visible just to the left of Nereus' right shoulder,
            facing forward with her head turned to the right and away.  She holds her right arm out to the left, her hand
            holding part of another cloth that flies over the Nereids.  Her right hand, visible just to the left of Nereus'
            shoulder, holds another section of the cloth.  Two more Nereids cavort just to the right of Doris.  The one
            in front faces forward, reclining on her right side with her left leg lying mostly above the waves to the right.
            She curls her torso upward and lifts her left arm up to the right, turning her head to look right.  The fingers 
            of her right hand are shown holding Doris' forearm.  Above and to the left of her, another Nereid faces forward,
            turning her bent head to the right.  She spreads her arms wide, and her left hand is visible holding another section 
            of banner.  At the right side of the design, three Nereids disport together.  The foremost one, half-submerged, faces away
            but turns her head left, her arms wide and her left hand holding part of a fourth banner.  To the right, the middle
            nymph sits or kneels, floating, with her legs bent and drawn up out of the water.  Although her legs face right,
            she turns her torso away and twists her head even further to look away and to the left.  She embraces the third
            Nereid with her bent right arm and raises her left forearm at 135 degrees, holding part of the banner with several
            fingers of this hand.  The third Nereid, farthest away from the viewer and nearest the right edge of the design, is
            shown from the breasts up facing forward.  She turns her head to the left and extends her right arm at 135 degrees,
            with her hand raised palm down, touching the banner-like cloth.  Her left forearm is bent upward at her side and her left hand
            rests on and perhaps holds the right forearm of the middle Nereid in this cluster of three.  All of the Nereids are nude except for
            folds of cloth that drape over their lower bodies, when visible, and merge with the water on which they float
            or in which they are partially submerged.  All of them have hair drawn back into buns except for the Nereid
            second to left and fifth from right, both of which may have short hair or hair drawn back into a bun.
            
            Two dolphins appear in the waves with the Nereids.  The head of one breaks the water
            to the right of Doris, its eye and snout visible above the surface facing left.  The head of the other
            emerges near the left side of the design, propping up the legs of a reclining Nereid,
            eye and snout facing left.  The Nereids hold cloths that fly above their heads like banners.  One
            curves over the head of a Nereid at the left side of the design.  Another extends from the Nereid
            second to left to just over Doris' head.  A third flies above the two Nereids to the right of Doris, and
            a fourth over the three Nereids at the right side of the design.
            The sea covers the bottom of the design from one side to the other, swirling around both
            all the Nereids and merging with the folds of fabric that often drape over their lower bodies when visible.
            It supports the nymphs who emerge from or float on its surface in various positions, forming little waves, especially
            to the left of the leftmost Nereid and around the bodies of Nereus and Doris.

                  her left arm bent upward, slightly forward from her side.  Her left hand is at her chin, which may
                  be resting on her extended forefinger; several fingers of this hand may be resting on her left shoulder.
                  Her slightly bent left arm is extended behind her and twisted gently behind her back.  
                  The back of this open hand rests
                  on her tail, which emerges from the water at the right, curves over and down to the left, and then rises again
                  to coil in a rightward turn.  She leans forward slightly, into Nereus, and her mouth is open.  
                  Her long hair is loose and
                  tumbles down to Nereus' hand on her back.

               over her left thigh and covers her foot and part of her lower left leg, seeming to merge with the waves on which
               she floats.  Her breasts are visible and her hair is drawn back into a bun.
               Above and slightly to the left of her, the upper body of another Nereid is visible.  She faces forward, but turns 
               her bent head to the right, so that her face is shown in profile looking down.  Her forearm, extended
               horizontally leftward, is all that is visible of her right arm.  Her left forearm is also extended nearly horizontally,
               and several fingers of her right hand hold a portion of the cloth that flies over her head like a banner.
               She appears nude, and the curves of her breasts are just visible between Doris and the other Nereid.  Her 
               hair is curled over her ears and may be short or may be pulled back behind her head.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="BD"><characteristic>Nereid</characteristic><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>nymph</characteristic><characteristic>arm at side</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent</characteristic><characteristic>arms bent</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>arm down</characteristic><characteristic>arm extended</characteristic><characteristic>arms extended</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised horizontally</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised at 135 degrees</characteristic><characteristic>arm resting</characteristic><characteristic>embracing</characteristic><characteristic>facing away</characteristic><characteristic>seen from behind</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>fingers</characteristic><characteristic>floating</characteristic><characteristic>sitting</characteristic><characteristic>kneeling</characteristic><characteristic>knees</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent at knee</characteristic><characteristic>legs bent</characteristic><characteristic>leg drawn up</characteristic><characteristic>legs drawn up</characteristic><characteristic>legs together</characteristic><characteristic>hand</characteristic><characteristic>hand holding</characteristic><characteristic>hand resting</characteristic><characteristic>hand raised, palm down</characteristic><characteristic>palm down</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>swimming</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>bun</characteristic><characteristic>upper body</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Three Nereids disport together at the right side of the design.  The foremost one is half-submerged
               in the water and visible only from the waist up; she may be swimming or floating.  She faces away but turns her head to the left so that her
               face is shown in profile.  Her bent right arm is down and extended to her right; she  may be embracing the legs 
               of the nymph to the right with this arm.  Her left arm is raised horizontally, forearm bent upwards.  The fingers
               of her left hand are visible above the shoulder of the nymph to the left, and may be grasping part of the cloth that
               flies over the three Nereids' heads like a banner.  
               To the right, partially hidden by this foremost nymph, is another who kneels
               or sits, floating, with her legs bent and drawn up out of the water.  Although her legs face right, she turns her torso away
               from the viewer, and twists her head even further to look away and to the left.  She holds her bent right arm out
               to embrace the third Nereid, behind her and to the right.  Her right hand rests on this third nymph's left shoulder.  
               Her forearm is visible raised at 135 degrees to the left, and she holds part of the same bannerlike cloth with several
               fingers of this hand.
               The third Nereid, farthest away from the viewer and nearest the right edge of the design, is shown from the breasts
               up facing forward.  She turns her head to the left and extends her right arm at 135 degrees, with her hand extended
               palm down, touching the
               bannerlike cloth.  Her left forearm is bent upward at her side and her left hand rests on and perhaps holds
               the right forearm of the middle nymph.
               All three nymphs are nude, with hair swept up into buns.

Her
               monster offspring flesh out the scene: the Sphinx (left), the triple-headed Geryon, the Chimera with
               its two heads (lion and goat), and the Hydra.  Echidna is positioned near the center of the design, facing
               forward and slightly left, though she turns her head slightly to the right.  She holds her bent right arm
               out horizontally to the left, and Typhon holds her right hand.  Her left hand is grasped in Geryon's hand, 
               to the right.  She is nude and has long hair, and a headpiece consisting of two ornamental serpents 
               appears above her forehead.  Her serpent lower body curves into three large coils near the bottom of 
               the design.  Typhon's body, to the left, leans leftward although his torso is twisted slightly forward
               and his head is turned to the right.  He holds his bent right arm extended across his body, hand raised
               and holding Echidna's right hand.  The fingers of his right hand are visible resting against Echidna's
               right hip and waist.  His relatively long hair flies loosely on either side of his head, 
               surmounted by two wings above his forehead.  He is nude.
               Lines that rise from his lower
               torso diagonally leftward before curving to the left and down may be intended to represent wind or a banner-like cloth.
               The Sphinx sits near the left side of the design.  Her lion's body faces left, while
               her human head turns to look right, her face seen in three-quarters profile.  Her feathered wings 
               are raised and folded behind her back.  Her body is covered in fur and she has claws on each
               foot.  Two or three breasts are visible beneath her abdomen.
               Triple-headed Geryon lunges left, just to the right of Echidna.  Alternatively,
               he may be seated on the back of the Chimera, below him.  His muscled
               right leg is bent and drawn forward, his foot on tiptoe, while his muscled left leg is 
               extended behind him, knee facing forward and foot on tiptoe.  His lower body faces forward and to the 
               left, but he twists his torso so that his chest and all three heads look left.  He holds his bent
               left arm at his side, and he grasps Echidna's left hand with this hand.  Each head wears a helmet,
               and both the heads with visible faces have beards.  He wears an armored breastplate over a short
               tunic.
               The Chimera, with the body of a lion and two heads, one of a lion and one of a goat,
               crouches or lies near the bottom of the design at the right, facing left. The lion head, encircled by a mane,
               also rests on the ground with mouth open and one tooth visible.  Flames or hot wind blast from the
               lion head's open mouth.  The goat head appears above the lion's head, with horns and a tuft of "beard."
               The Chimera's tail spirals in corkscrews behind it, nearer to the right edge of the design.
               The Hydra coils near the right side of the design, its body rising from the ground
               in at least three large coils.  Five snake heads are visible, each facing right with mouth open and breathing fire 
               or clouds of smoke.  The forked tongue of the lowest head is also extended.

               Boreas, the north wind, with clenched fists; Zephyrus, the west wind, emptying rain
               from a bowl; and Notus, the south wind, bearing flowers.  Astraeus stands or hovers near the middle of 
               the design, his feet resting on Zephyrus' buttocks.  He faces forward and leans slightly left
               as he embraces Aurora with his left arm and clasps her hand with his right hand.  He is nude
               except for a cloth that wraps around his pelvis.  Aurora stands or hovers left just to the right
               of Astraeus, facing left.  Her left arm is at her side, and her right forearm is extended slightly
               so that she can hold Astraeus' hand with her right hand.  She seems to be supported by the
               lower body of Notus.  She wears a crown or tiara with a bun and a long layered sleeveless gown; 
               the top, decorative layer swirls around her.  Zephyrus flies or hovers near the bottom left corner
               in a nearly prone position.  His legs are bent with his right knee down and his left leg 
               extended.  He is letting raindrops fall from a bowl, which he carries with the opening facing away
               from the viewer.  He wears mid-calf boots with laces, and a cloak or sleeveless tunic that drapes
               over his shoulder and covers both legs.  Boreas hovers or flies just above Zephyrus.  He faces left
               and away from the viewer; his left shoulder is raised and both arms are extended rigidly straight out
               in front of him, his hands clenched in fists.  His lower body is mostly hidden.  He is wearing a cloak that
               wraps around his upper body and billows behind him.  Notus flies or hovers in the lower right corner.
               His legs are bent and extended behind him, while his lower body twists up and forward so that his shoulders
               face forward on a diagonal from upper left to lower right.  He turns his head slightly left.  His bent
               right arm is at his side, with his hand resting in or holding the flowers that lie collected in his garment.
               His left arm is at his side, bent upward and wrapped in the same garment.  He is wearing a cloak that drapes
               over his pelvis, wraps around his left arm, and flutters in the air below and behind him.  Lines extending in a curving diagonal up from his head
               to the left suggest a rainbow or wind.
               Lucifer, the morning star, shines at the top of the plate.  He hovers facing forward with arms spread wide,
               leaning left.  He holds a flaming torch up with his right hand, and a star shines above his head.  He is nude.

               her left hand she grasps a cloth with a decorative hem that flutters behind her and wraps

                        for another held by Rhea.
               He kneels facing right with right leg bent and his right knee resting on the ground, his right foot on 
               tiptoe.  His left knee is bent upward and his left foot is flat on the ground.  
               Bending forward, he stretches his right arm
               out in front of him nearly horizontally and grasps the lower arm of the child with Rhea.  She
               holds Saturn's right wrist.  His left arm is bent and drawn back, and he holds the
               forearm of the child behind his back with this hand.  He is nude and has long hair and a beard.  His
               head is encircled by a band over his hair.
               The child that Saturn holds behind him dangles facing away and slightly to the
               right, bending or falling backward.  His legs are spread and both are bent.  
               His left arm hangs down, slightly bent, from his shoulder. Saturn holds his right upper arm up horizontally,
               while his lower arm dangles downward.  He is nude and has short hair.
               Rhea (Ops to the Greeks) sits or kneels facing right and slightly forward at the right side of the design.
               She leans right, away from Saturn, although she tilts her head back and turns it left.  Her
               mouth is open and her eyes are raised.  Her bent left arm embraces a child resting upside down on her
               lap.  With her right hand she grasps
               Saturn's wrist as he holds the child's forearm.  She is wearing a long gown that covers her
               lower body entirely so that it is difficult to see how she is seated, except that her knees are
               bent.  She has short hair, or long hair escaping at the nape of her neck from her coiffure, and wears
               a hood or cloak over her head.  The child on her lap lies with its head bent back so that 
               its face is visible upside down, looking up.
               Its right arm is bent upward by Saturn's grasp.  It is swathed in cloth that drapes its lower body
               and falls in folds to the floor to the right of Rhea.  Otherwise it is nude.  It has short hair and
               may be male or female.
               Two spirits hover or fly in the background, their bodies horizontal, or nearly so.
               Both are positioned with their heads toward the right side of the design.  The spirit to the
               right is visible from the thighs up.  Her torso faces forward, but she turns her head to look
               up.  She holds her slightly bent right arm vertically up over her head, and holds a flower
               with two fingers of her right hand.  Her left arm is bent upward and held close to her side, her
               hand near her shoulder.  She is wearing a gown, belted at the waist, with a cloak draped
               over her right shoulder and fluttering down past her waist.  Her hair seems to be drawn back
               into a bun.  The lower body of the spirit at the left faces forward and down, with
               her legs together, but she twists
               at the waist so that her upper body faces forward and slightly up.  Her right arm is
               bent upward near her side, her right hand near her shoulder.  She holds her left arm out and bent upward,
               and she is holding a large bunch of grapes with this hand.  She is wearing a skirt and shirt, or a gown
               with a second layer covering her upper body, belted at the waist. 
               A band of vegetation arches gently across the plate from upper left corner to lower
               right corner.  Near the upper left corner it consists of tassled grain surrounding the leftmost
               spirit.  As it progresses rightward, near Saturn's head it changes to flowers in bloom surrounding
               the rightmost spirit.  As it reaches and passes Rhea it becomes branches of leaves, some with berries
               (see just to the right of Rhea's left arm).

                        in the inscription) to save
               him from Saturn (Cronus to the Greeks).  She kneels facing right, bending forward and passing Zeus rightward to Gaia.  
               She holds
               both arms, slightly bent, out at 45 degrees.  Her right hand grasps Zeus's right arm.  She is dressed in a long
               gown, belted at the waist.  Folds of its skirt, and/or of Zeus's cloth draped over her left arm and knee, fall
               over the edge of the precipice or other support on which she kneels (not pictured).  Her hair is drawn back into
               a bun or ponytail.  Zeus, the child, lies supine as he is passed from Rhea to Gaia.  His right arm, which Rhea
               holds, is at his side.  He has short hair and is nude except for a cloth draped over his lower body, which then
               falls onto Gaia's lap.  His eyes are closed.
               Gaia sits facing left at the right side of the design, receiving Zeus from Rhea's hands.  Her left arm is at
               her side, bent to lie along her lap, and she supports Zeus with her left hand.  Her bent right leg seems to
               be crossed over her left.  She is dressed in a long sleeveless gown.  Her hair is drawn back into a bun, and atop
               her head sits a hat or crown decorated with acanthus(?) leaves and with a long transparent veil that falls down her back, over her
               shoulder, and ends in folds of fabric that drape over the edge of her seat (not pictured). 
               The head of a lion with a large mane is shown lying next to Gaia in the lower right corner of the design.
               It extends both front legs in front of its head, lying on the ground.  Gaia's father, Uranus, looks down
               on the scene from his position between clouds in the sky above.  He faces forward, leaning to the right
               with his left elbow propped on the clouds that surround him and his left hand at his forehead.  His body curves 
               to the left, leaning against or lying along the clouds.  The top of his right leg is visible bent upward above the clouds.
               His right arm is out to the left, his hand resting on another cloud.  He is nude and has a beard and
               long hair that flies around his head.  Seven stars shine in the night sky.

                  Bending forward, she passes Zeus rightward to Gaia.  She holds both arms, slightly
                  bent, out at 45 degrees.  Her right hand grasps Zeus's right arm.  She bends her head back slightly.

Zeus and one of the brothers 
               embrace one another on the right.  Both Zeus and the brother are nude and have short hair.  
               Both cast shadows extending from their feet and legs.
               The brother, positioned to the right, steps forward and up with his bent left leg,
               his right leg extended behind him.  His lower body
               faces right, but he twists his torso away from the viewer so that his upper body is seen from
               behind.  His bent left arm is raised to the left and wrapped around Zeus's back.  He holds his 
               right arm in front of him, his forearm bent upward and his right hand holding Zeus's left.
               He leans forward slightly.
               Zeus, to the left, is taller.  He faces right, but turns his head
               to look forward so that his face is seen in three-quarters profile.  He steps up with his bent left leg, his
               left foot on tiptoe.  His right leg is extended behind him, and this foot is also
               on tiptoe.  His right arm is extended down at his side, drawn slightly back, and he grasps the other brother's 
               hands with his
               right hand.  His left hand is visible just above the rightmost brother's shoulder, holding his hand.
               Zeus helps this brother, positioned nearer the left side of the plate, to ascend
               the slope the three climb.  This brother faces right, although his torso is twisted slightly toward the viewer.
               He bends backward slightly.
               His right leg is extended backward, and his left leg is bent and drawn upward.  Both feet are on tiptoe; his
               left toes rest higher up the slope than the right.  He holds his bent right arm out in front of him, his hand raised
               to hold Zeus's.  His left forearm is visible in a similar upraised position, and his left hand is wrapped
               around Zeus's wrist.  He is nude except for a cloth that drapes over his left thigh, falling to the ground behind
               and between his feet.  He has a beard and short hair.  Both feet cast small shadows.
               Saturn's head, shoulders, and arms are visible to the left of the leftmost brother,
               above an outcropping of rock.  He faces forward but leans left, tilting his head back to look up to
               the right. He is nude and has a beard and
               short hair.
               The sun is rising or setting over the edge of the horizon, which may be a hill or mountain in the distance.
               Its beams of light
               extend upward and rightward to the top and the right side of the design.

Zeus stands or
               strides with legs spread near the center of the design, his left leg resting on the back of a Titan
               below him to the right and his right leg forward.  He holds at least three stylized lightning bolts in each hand;
               a cloth billows around behind him.  He has a beard and short hair.
               Ares, to the left of Zeus, plunges his spear into the chest of a 
               Triton, below.  Upside down, his body faces left although he bends backwards so that his shoulders and
               head face down.  He holds the long shaft of his spear with both hands.  He wears a crested helmet and
               a cloth crosses his left thigh and between his legs.  Apollo draws a bow and arrow near the right 
               side of the design.  His body faces downward but he twists his torso to face forward.  His right arm
               is raised horizontally (relative to his body), with elbow drawn back and right hand holding the drawn bowstring.  His left
               arm is extended straight in front of him, holding the bow and shaft of the arrow.  A cloth billows 
               around him, covering his genitals and forming a semi-circle to the right.  All three of these gods
               are nude.
               Three other gods face left in a shoulder-to-shoulder line near the left side of the design.  From left
               to right they are Hermes, Athena, and Poseidon.  Only Hermes's right arm and head, wearing a hat or helmet,
               are visible.  Athena wears a crested helmet and belted gown.  Her bent left leg is forward and she holds
               the long shaft of a weapon over her left shoulder.  Poseidon leans forward with one bent leg forward, and
               he holds a trident.  He is nude and has a beard and relatively short hair.
               The seven Titans lie in various states of distress across the bottom of the design.  Two, lying face down
               near the left side of the design, may be dead or dying.  Another near the left side leans back and 
               holds the middle point of Poseidon's trident.  One upside down near the center holds the shaft of the
               spear that Ares plunges into his chest.  A fifth hunches over near the right side of the design.  The
               heads of two additional Tritons appear to either side of the Triton grasping Poseidon's spear.  All of
               the Tritons have serpent-like tails that coil between and around their bodies.

The three
               most visible Giants are probably Gyges, Briareus, and Cottus (see the engraved inscription below the design).  
               Hesiod's text does not permit specific identification of each Giant in Flaxman's design.  One Giant kneels
               in the center of the top half of the design, with left leg bent and drawn up and right leg extended 
               down to the left.  Both feet rest on tiptoe on the Titans below.  His arms are raised and bent 
               backward, and he holds the trunk of a tree behind him.  The root ball of the tree is visible just 
               above his left thigh.  Another Giant faces left at the left side of the design, his left leg bent and
               drawn forward and his left foot resting on the neck of a Titan below.  He bends forward and twists
               hist torso away, lifting both arms up to the right to hold up a tree trunk.  More of the trunk and
               part of the tree's root ball is visible to the left of his torso.  Another Giant faces right
               at the right side of the design, bending forward to throw a boulder at the Titan below him.  His
               left leg is bent and drawn forward, and his left foot rests on a rock or boulder to the right of
               the rightmost Titan.  His right leg is bent and drawn forward slightly; his shin may be resting on the
               torso of the same Titan.  His arms are raised and hold a boulder over his head.  All three principal
               Giants are nude.  The upraised arms of 
               other Giants, their bodies hidden behind the three named Giants, are shown holding boulders (and
               one tree trunk) to throw down at the Titans below.
               The upper body of a Titan lies face up near the lower right corner of the design; he may be dead or dying.
               A Titan near the middle bends forward so deeply that his head touches the ground.  He faces forward but
               twists his torso slightly to the right.  He turns his head to the right and forward so that his face
               is visible in partial profile, upside down.  His right arm is bent upward and resting on the ground, while his
               left arm is extended horizontally, his left fingers resting on the ground.  Two Titans lie face up
               at the left side of the design.  Only the head of the leftmost Titan is visible, tilted back so that the 
               face is shown upside down.  The foot of the leftmost principal Giant rests on his throat.  The other Titan lies supine with his torso
               twisted slightly to the left.  His left leg is raised and bent, resting on the leftmost Giant's thigh.  This Titan's right knee
               is raised vertically.  He holds the right leg of the central Giant with both hands; the Giant's right foot rests on 
               this Titan's torso.

The rightmost god
               sits leaning over with one knee up, facing left but turning his head to look away from the viewer.
               His head bent back slightly.
               A large club, probably made of wood, is propped on his left shoulder and resting on his knee.  His bent right arm is extended
               in front of him and resting on the club.  His left arm is likewise extended, his left hand resting
               on top of and hiding his right.  He is nude and bearded with short hair.
               The leftmost god sits facing forward and to the right, turning his head to look right and away.
               One knee is raised, and a large club, probably made of wood, rests against it and leans against his right shoulder.  His
               right arm is at his side, bent upward with right hand holding the club.  His left forearm is bent
               upward across his body, left hand resting on the club just above the right.  He is nude and bearded
               with short hair.  Only part of the head of the third god is visible, appearing between the heads of the other
               two, looking upward to the left.  He has short hair and may also have a beard.
