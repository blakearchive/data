                The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of fully searchable and scalable electronic editions of the following works related to Blake’s development of his illustrations to Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>: Preliminary Sketches for Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, listed under Drawings and Paintings, Pencil Sketches; Preliminary Drawings for Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, listed under Drawings and Paintings, Monochrome Wash Drawings; and Preliminary Illustrations to Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, listed under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.<lb/><lb/>
                In addition, we are republishing the following works, previously presented in our Preview mode, to make their designs fully searchable: Robert Blair, <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, the 1808 book listed under Commercial Book Illustrations, Designed by Blake and Engraved by Other Engravers; <hi rend="i">Deaths Door</hi>, listed under Separate Plates and Plates in Series, Designed and Engraved by Blake; and Illustrations to Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, the series of twenty finished designs, listed under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.<lb/><lb/>
                Taken together, these works in a variety of media present a comprehensive overview of one of Blake’s major projects as an illustrator and exemplify his working methods as he developed rough sketches into finished water colors.  The evolution of any one design can be traced via links presented under Related Works in the Archive on the pull-down menus, lower left on the main viewing page for each work. <lb/><lb/>
                In October 1805, Blake was commissioned by the engraver and would-be publisher Robert H. Cromek to prepare forty drawings illustrating Robert Blair's <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, a popular "Graveyard" school poem first published in 1743.  Cromek originally planned to select twenty of these designs for a deluxe edition of the poem.  Blake launched into the project with great enthusiasm, rapidly sketching out his illustrations in pencil, developing some into wash drawings, and then producing a group of more finished water colors for presentation to Cromek.  In a first prospectus of November 1805, Cromek names Blake as both the designer and engraver of fifteen designs.  Blake etched one image, <hi rend="i">Deaths Door</hi>, in white-line, but Cromek rejected it.  The dark power of the print appeals to modern tastes, but was far from fashionable in the early nineteenth century.  In a second prospectus, also of November 1805, Cromek announced that Louis Schiavonetti would engrave twelve designs for the new edition.  Blake had lost the potentially lucrative commission to engrave his own designs; his relationship with Cromek descended into anger and argument.  In spite of their disagreement, Cromek included a portrait of Blake as a frontispiece to the volume, published in 1808.  Cromek promoted the book aggressively and the illustrations to <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> became Blake's best known work through much of the nineteenth century. <lb/><lb/>

                <lb/><lb/><b>October 2007</b><lb/><lb/>
                The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of the
                electronic edition of Blake's illustrations to Robert Blair's <hi rend="i">The
                    Grave</hi>, accompanied by the related separate plate of <hi rend="i">Deaths
                    Door</hi>. Both are presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the
                features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (our image annotation program).<lb/><lb/> The illustrations to <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> are among Blake's most
                important commissions for commercially published book illustrations. The engraver
                and would-be publisher R. H. Cromek hired Blake to illustrate Blair's popular
                "Graveyard" poem in 1805. Blake produced one design, <hi rend="">Deaths Door</hi>,
                as a white-line etching, but Cromek found this so unsatisfactory that he quickly
                turned to the fashionable engraver Louis Schiavonetti to etch and engrave twelve of
                Blake's illustrations. These were published, along with a frontispiece portrait of
                Blake included in our electronic edition, in 1808. Blake's reputation as an artist
                through the first half of the nineteenth century was based largely on these images.<lb/><lb/> As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access

                        kneel or crouch furthest left. The female is seen from behind and faces
                        away. The male figure's arms are bent and wrap around the waist of the
                        female; her arms wrap around his neck and shoulders. The figures are
                        embracing and may also be kissing. A male and female adult couple stand
                        third and fourth from the left; they are probably the father and mother of

                        the female; his left hand holds her buttocks. The female's arms are bent and

                        shoulder with the fingers slightly spread. A male child and female child
                        stand fifth and sixth from the left; only the male's upper body is clearly
                        visible. The male's arms are bent and wrap around the waist of the female
                        child; the figures are embracing and may be kissing. A male child stands
                        furthest right with his mouth open. He faces left with his right leg bent
                        back and his right foot raised on tiptoe; he may be walking or running. His
                        arms are raised at 135 degrees and extend to the left with the palms held
                        vertically; he may be reaching towards his mother and father. The scene is
                        set in heaven. Two vertical columns of clouds appear in the sky above the

                            the right foot raised on tiptoe; he may be walking or running. His arms
                            are raised at 135 degrees and extend to the left with the palms held
                            vertically, fingers spread; he may be reaching towards his mother and
                            father. A narrow shadow extends to the right from the child's left
                            foot.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="object" location="E"><characteristic>sky</characteristic><characteristic>cloud</characteristic><characteristic>heaven</characteristic><characteristic>floor</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The scene is set in heaven.

The ceiling of the tomb
                        arches above the central figures. The tomb is probably made of stone. The
                        figures lay horizontally on a woven mat; it may be made of straw. Their
                        heads rest on pillows to the left. The lowest figure is a gowned male with
                        long hair and a beard; he is identified in the inscription as the counselor.
                        His right arm rests at his side and he holds a partially unrolled scroll in
                        his right hand. A seal dangles from the lower end of the scroll. The second
                        figure from the bottom is a gowned male with long, curly hair and a short
                        beard. He wears a crown and is identified in the inscription as a king; his
                        right arm rests at his side and he holds a scepter with his right hand. The
                        third figure from the bottom is a male figure wearing armor and a plumed
                        helmet; he is identified in the inscription as a warrior, and may be a
                        knight or soldier. The warrior holds a sheathed sword with both hands. His
                        feet rest on the back and head of a sculpted animal, probably a lion. The
                        fourth figure from the bottom is a gowned female with long hair; she is
                        identified in the inscription as a mother. Her left arm rests at her side
                        with her hand resting on the child above. The child is gowned and has curly
                        hair. The left and upper walls of the tomb are lined with Gothic arches or
                        small niches, perhaps eighteen in all; at least four of these contain
                        statues. Two winged angel statues stand to the left and right of the oil
                        lamp, facing forward. Both angels are gowned and may have long hair. Their
                        arms are apparently down at their sides. The statue of a female(?) stands
                        along the left border of the design, left of the king's head. She has long
                        hair and wears a crown and a cloak or gown. Above and to the right stands a
                        statue of a gowned male. Both statues face right. Three Gothic arches appear
                        in the center of the upper wall, directly above the child; a shelf is
                        recessed behind the arches. An oil lamp burns above the figures on the
                        shelf; the lamp's handle forms a loop. Fourteen figures appear along the
                        upper and lower borders of the design; they may represent statues or
                        carvings on the tomb. Six winged angels appear above the arch of the
                        ceiling. The figures appear to lay prone against the arch; each has one arm
                        bent upward in front of its chest. Eight gowned figures appear along the
                        lower border of the image. The figures lay on their sides in a reclining
                        position. Each figure appears to rest its head on its hand. Vegetative
                        motifs, possibly leaves, appear in the upper corners of the
                        design.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="CD"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>corpse</characteristic><characteristic>dead</characteristic><characteristic>lying</characteristic><characteristic>supine</characteristic><characteristic>body horizontal</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>feet</characteristic><characteristic>legs together</characteristic><characteristic>arm at side</characteristic><characteristic>arm resting</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>scroll</characteristic><characteristic>seal</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>eyes closed</characteristic><characteristic>facing up</characteristic><characteristic>counselor</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Five corpses lay supine in an ornate tomb; the figures' bodies

                            rests at his side and he holds a partially unrolled scroll in his right
                            hand. A seal dangles from the lower end of the scroll. His eyes are

                            he is identified in the inscription as a warrior, and may be a knight or
                            soldier. The figure wears a helmet with a large plume. A belt or sash is
                            visible around his waist. His legs are crossed at the knees with the
                            left over the right; he may wear spurs. The warrior's right arm is bent
                            upwards and he grasps the hilt of a sheathed sword with his right hand;
                            his left arm is at his side and he holds the sheath with his left hand.
                            He has a mustache but is not bearded. His eyes are raised. His feet rest
                            on the back and head of a sculpted animal, probably a

                        left portion of the wall. The body of a muscular male figure lies partly
                        supine, partly on its side, in the lower half of the design; he is
                        identified in the inscription as "the Strong Wicked Man." He lies on a woven
                        matpossibly made of strawand a sheet or bundle of sheets. He is partly
                        nude with a loincloth or sheet covering his genitals. The figure's head is
                        bent back and rests on his left shoulder. The figure's legs are together and
                        extend to the left. Both arms are bent and rest at his side; he clutches at
                        a sheet with both hands. He is dying and may even be dead. A broken chalice
                        or goblet appears to the left of the corpse's left hand; liquid spills out
                        to the left. A nude, muscular male flies or hovers in the upper portion of
                        the design. This figure probably represents the spirit of the male figure
                        below. The spirit is surrounded by fire; the flames rise up and to the left
                        and may pass through the open window. The spirit is seen from behind and
                        rises up and to the left with his body nearly horizontal. His right leg is
                        extended down and to the right with his left leg bent and drawn up; the sole
                        of his left foot is turned out toward the viewer. The figure's head is
                        turned to the left in profile; his mouth is open and he wears an expression
                        of surprise or fear. The spirit's left arm is bent to the left with the palm
                        held vertically; his right arm is not clearly pictured, but his right hand
                        is also held vertically left of his head. A gowned female with long hair
                        kneels or lunges above the corpse with her body horizontal. Her mouth is
                        open and she looks down and to the right toward the corpse below; her
                        expression and posture suggest grief or despair. Her right leg is bent and
                        drawn up; her left leg extends to the left with her foot raised on tiptoe.
                        Both arms are bent with her hands positioned beside her head; her palms are
                        nearly vertical with respect to her head and her fingers are slightly
                        spread. A gowned female with long hair stands at the right border of the
                        design. She faces left in profile. Her left foot is visible below the hem of
                        her gown. The figure's head is turned down; her left arm is bent and she
                        covers her face with her left hand. Her posture suggests grief or

                        title inscription) strewn with large stones. Several stairs and a path wind
                        between the stones; twenty-two figures appear along the pathway. Several
                        dark shadows appear on the stones, particularly along the left and right
                        borders. Distant mountains are visible through the mouth of the cave in the
                        upper portion of the design. Clouds appear in the sky above the mountains.
                        Two gowned females(?) stand in the upper left portion of the design. The
                        figure closest to the viewer stands with her right leg bent back; the pair
                        likely walks to the right. Both figures are slightly hunched over. The
                        figure closest to the viewer has her head down; both arms are bent and she
                        covers her face with her hands. The figure furthest from the viewer holds a
                        walking stick in her right hand. A gowned, bearded old man kneels or crawls
                        at the top of a set of stairs in the upper portion of the design. The figure
                        is bent over with his left knee drawn up to his chest. His left foot is
                        visible below the hem of his garment. His arms are down and both hands are
                        on the ground with the palms down; he may be bracing or supporting himself.
                        A gowned female carries an infant below and to the right of the stairs; only
                        her upper body is visible. Her right arm is bent and she holds the infant
                        with both hands; she is likely the infant's mother. The child sits in the
                        female's arms, facing left. Both legs are bent and its left arm is bent
                        upward; the infant may reach for or hold onto the female. A male figure with
                        long hair appears to the right of the mother and child. He is visible only
                        from the knees up; he appears to be running or walking to the right. His
                        left arm is raised horizontally and his right arm is raised at 45 degrees;
                        both palms are turned out, away from the figure's body. The figure may wear
                        a shirt. Cloth or other drapery appears over his right arm. The head and
                        shoulders of a male figure appear in the upper portion of the design along
                        the right border, to the right of the running male. The figure faces right
                        and is hunched over with his head down and his face in shadow; he may have a
                        beard. A male figure with long hair runs to the left in the upper right
                        portion of the design. The figure's left leg is bent forward and his right
                        leg is bent back; his arms are raised horizontally with the palms turned
                        out, away from his body. He may look towards the figures to the left. A
                        gowned female and old male with long hair and a beard stand immediately left
                        of the running male. The female faces forward with her head turned up and
                        slightly right. Her arms are bent and she clutches at the side of her head
                        with both hands; her posture and gesture may suggest grief or despair. The
                        male figure faces left with his shoulders slightly hunched and his head
                        down. Both feet are visible below the hem of his garment; he may walk to the
                        left. His arms are down and he holds a crutch in each hand; he leans
                        slightly forward onto the crutches. A gowned female with long hair stands
                        below and to the left of the male with crutches. She faces forward with her
                        head turned to the left in profile. The figure's arms are bent in front of
                        her chest; her hands are held together with the palms down. Her head is down
                        slightly and may rest on her hands. A male figure with short hair stands in
                        the lower portion of the design directly below the male holding crutches. He
                        walks to the right with his right leg is bent and his right foot raised on
                        tiptoe. His arms are bent in front of his chest with the hands held together
                        and the palms vertical; he may be praying. A gowned female holds an infant
                        in the lower right portion of the design. Her right leg is bent back with
                        her right foot raised on tiptoe; she walks to the right. The figure is
                        slightly hunched over. Her left arm is raised at 135 degrees with the palm
                        held vertically and the fingers spread. Her right arm is bent and she holds
                        an infant to her chest; she is likely its mother. The infant faces left with
                        its left arm raised; it may reach for or touch the female. A gowned female
                        stands in the lower right portion of the design. She wears a veil or other
                        cloth drapery over her hair. The figure stands facing forward with her head
                        turned to the left; she looks down at the children to the left. Both arms

                        altar. A halo of light surrounds Christ's head with beams of light radiating
                        outward. His arms are bent and rest at his sides; he holds an open book
                        across his lap. Two gowned, winged angels kneel on stones or cushions to the
                        left and right of Christ. Both angels hold pens or quills and may write on
                        tablets or books resting on (stone?) pillars. Eight gowned male figures sit
                        to the left and right of the central throne or altar in the upper portion of
                        the design. Each has long hair and a beard and wears a crown; they may
                        represent kings. The four figures to the left face left and the four figures
                        to the right face right. The two figures closest to the center each has a
                        scoll resting on his lap. A pair of gowned angels flies or hovers above
                        Christ on outstretched wings; each figure holds and plays a harp. Eight nude
                        infants or putti sit on a cloud above and to the left of Christ, and the
                        heads and shoulders of four old figures appear above and to the right of
                        Christ. Three angels hover or fly in the upper left portion of the design;
                        their wings are covered with small eyes or other circular designs. The
                        central angel holds a tray carrying two loaves of bread and two goblets or
                        chalices. The heads and shoulders of six figures appear directly below the
                        three winged angels; they may be hovering or flying. Below, three gowned
                        males with long hair and beards kneel on a cloud. The central figure's arms
                        are bent with the palms held together vertically in prayer; the figures to
                        the left and right cross their arms in front of their chests. A group of

                        they may be seen from behind. Etched lines across the group may suggest that
                        they are in shadow. A gowned couple appears below; the figures face each
                        other and embrace with their arms slightly bent and raised horizontally. Two
                        gowned figures with braided hair kneel or crouch on a cloud below the
                        embracing couple. The figure to the left grasps the upper corners of an open
                        book while the figure to the right supports it from the bottom with his or
                        her palms turned up. Two gowned angels with short, curly hair fly or hover
                        in the upper right portion of the design; their wings are covered with small
                        eyes or other circular designs. The angel to the right holds a large pitcher
                        with both hands; the angel to the left likely holds the second pitcher.
                        Liquid pours from both pitchers into a bowl held by at least one of the four
                        nude children or putti below; the child furthest left is positioned with his
                        legs spread and his left leg extended backward. Three gowned females kneel
                        on a cloud below the group of angels. The figure furthest left may have her
                        breasts exposed; a nude infant or child stands below the figure and reaches
                        upward with his or her arms raised vertically. The central female cradles a
                        swaddled infant with her left arm. The female furthest right wears a veil or
                        scarf over her head. Her left arm is extended downward and she may touch the
                        hip of a nude child to the right; the child stands facing left with his legs
                        bent and feet raised on tiptoe. Two nude children sit or kneel to the right
                        of the gowned females; the figures embrace and may kiss. A group of
                        indistinct figures appears above the embracing couple; only the figures'
                        heads are visible and they may be in shadow. A nude child with short hair
                        flies or hovers below the female figures; the figure is seen from behind
                        with its body nearly horizontal and its legs extended to the right. Two
                        gowned figures appear in the upper right portion of the design, below and to
                        the right of the kneeling females. The figures face each other and embrace
                        with their arms bent and wrapped around each other; they appear to be
                        kissing. Two gowned males with short hair kneel on a cloud below the
                        embracing couple; the figure to the right holds the upper corners of an open
                        book while the figure to the left supports it from the bottom with his palms
                        turned up. Two bearded males kneel on a cloud below and to the right of the
                        figures holding a book. Three nude angels stand on a stone in the lower
                        portion of the design, directly below Christ; they likely represent
                        seraphim. Fire surrounds the seraphim and extends upward to the base of
                        Christ's throne or altar. Flames are also visible among the stones or
                        mountains to the left and right. The central seraph has three pairs of
                        wings. His arms are bent upward and he holds and plays a trumpet with both
                        hands. Two additional trumpets appear above and to the left and right of the
                        central seraph, each held by a single disembodied hand; the bells of all
                        three trumpets are filled with fire. The seraphim to the left and right have
                        at least two pairs of wings and each hold a sheathed sword. Four males
                        appear below the three seraphim in the lower portion of the design; the
                        figures may be partially buried. Only the head of the figure furthest left
                        is visible. The figure to the right turns his head up and to the right; his
                        eyes are raised and his expression may suggest fear. The figure third from
                        the left is seen from behind; his arms are raised horizontally and his hands
                        rest on figures to the left and right. The figure furthest right crouches or
                        kneels with his body horizontal and his head down. Both arms are bent upward
                        and wrap around his head and his hands rest on the back of his head. The
                        heads of two figures appear within a cave in the lower right portion of the
                        design. A serpent, lizard, or dragon appears in the lower right corner of
                        the design; only its head and a single leg are visible. The animal faces
                        right with its mouth open and teeth visible. A nude female with long hair
                        kneels or crouches in a twisted posture in the lower right corner of the
                        design; her arms are bent and at least her left hand may clutch at her head.
                        Six figures, or a single figure with six heads, stands in the lower right
                        corner of the design, above the nude female; the figure is seen from behind
                        and is covered with scales. Only the head furthest left is clearly visible;
                        a large curved horn grows from its forehead. Two figures lay on stones above
                        and to the left of the multi-headed figure. The lower figure rests upside
                        down with his arms bent to either side of his head; the upper figure’s head
                        is down and the he appears to lie in a prone position on top of the lower
                        figure's left leg. A group of figures appears above the multi-headed figure,
                        extending from the right border towards the center of the design. Several
                        figures wear helmets and armor; they may be soldiers or knights. As many as
                        seven spears are visible, and a circular object directly above the
                        multi-headed figure may represent a shield. A gowned figure with long hair
                        stands third from the right. The figure's arms are bent upward with the
                        hands held beside his or her face; the figure's mouth is open and the
                        expression suggests fear. Further left, the figures become less distinctive
                        and only their heads are visible. A building with a domed roof appears in
                        shadow just left of the group. Eight nude males fall below and to the right
                        of Christ's throne; six of the figures are upside down, and five are seen
                        from behind. A snake is wrapped around the body of the lowest figure in the
                        group. The figure furthest right, probably a devil, hovers with his body
                        positioned horizontally and his head to the right. His right arm is wrapped
                        around the waist of the figure to the left; in his left hand he holds a
                        chain that may be attached to the other figure's head or neck. The upper
                        bodies of four figures appear in the lower left portion of the design, just
                        left of the seraphim; they may represent a family. A gowned female with long
                        hair appears furthest left; her right arm is bent and may rest on the rock
                        below. A gowned male with long hair and a beard appears to the right; he
                        embraces or touches the other three figures. Below, a nude figure of
                        indeterminate gender is seen from behind. To the right, a nude male faces
                        right with his left arm raised vertically. The heads of at least three
                        figures appear in the lower left corner of the design; all three face right
                        with their eyes raised. A nude couple sits or kneels on a stone in the lower
                        left portion of the design. The female (left) is seen from behind; her arms
                        are raised and likely wrap around her partner’s neck. The male (right) holds
                        the female’s left hip and right buttock. The figures’ heads are together and
                        they are likely kissing. The heads of at least three figures are visible to
                        the left of the embracing couple; they face forward and slightly right with
                        their heads turned up. A nude female with long hair hovers or stands on a
                        stone to the left of the seraphim. Her right arm is bent and she holds a
                        nude infant against her chest; the infant’s right arm is raised horizontally
                        and may reach upwards towards its mother's face or hair. The female figure's
                        left arm is raised at 135 degrees and her left hand touches a nude male to
                        the right. He is seen from behind and faces away with his head turned to the
                        left; he likely looks towards the female to the left. A gowned male with
                        long hair and beard stands or hovers between the two figures; his arms are
                        not visible, but the position of his hands suggests that they are raised at
                        45 degrees. Ten figures hover in the lower left portion of the design; they
                        may rise upward. A gowned female with her hair drawn back in a bun is seen
                        from behind and faces away with her head turned up and to the right; her
                        arms are raised vertically with the palms turned away from the viewer and
                        the fingers spread. Above, a nude male(?) with short hair holds his arms
                        down at his sides; his left hand may touch the female figure below. The head
                        and arms of a figure are seen from behind near the left border of the
                        design; his or her arms are raised vertically with the hands held together
                        in prayer. Above, a gowned female(?) with long hair is seen from behind; she
                        may be slightly hunched over with her head down. To the right, a nude male
                        with short, curly hair raises his right arm vertically with the palm turned
                        out toward the viewer; his left hand touches or embraces the left hip of the
                        female to the right. The female’s arms are bent with the palms held together
                        vertically; she may be praying. A gowned female with long hair raises her
                        right arm at 135 degrees with the palm turned slightly out toward the
                        viewer; her left arm is only partially visible and appears to be raised at
                        45 degrees. Two nude infants hover below and to the left of Christ's throne.
                        The infant to the left faces forward with his genitals exposed; the infant
                        to the right is seen from behind with his or her arms raised at 135 degrees
                        and the hands held together in prayer. A nude male with short hair hovers
                        below and to the left of Christ's throne; he is seen from behind and faces
                        away from the viewer with his head turned up and slightly right. Both arms
                        are raised at approximately 135 degrees and his hands are held together in
                        prayer.</illusobjdesc><component type="object" location="A"><characteristic>cloud</characteristic><illusobjdesc>At least one column of clouds fills the upper left portion of

                        burns above the corpse. A male with short, curly hair stands above the cave.
                        The figure is partly nude and wears short pants. Both legs are bent and are
                        spread apart. His body faces forward with his head turned down to the left;
                        his torso is twisted and bends to the left. The figure's arms are bent to
                        the right with the palms held vertically. His eyes are cast down and he may
                        be looking at the ground or the figure below; his mouth is open and his
                        expression suggests fear or surprise. A series of distant mountains appears
                        to the left and right of the male figure. A group of buildings to the right
                        of the male figure's left foot suggests a distant city. The city may be
                        walled. Perhaps four windows are visible on the lowest building or wall. A
                        triangular spire or pyramid rises above the other buildings. A crescent moon
                        appears in the sky between the male figure's legs.</illusobjdesc><component type="object" location="E"><characteristic>cave</characteristic><characteristic>stone</characteristic><characteristic>grave</characteristic><characteristic>tomb</characteristic><characteristic>grave</characteristic><characteristic>shadow</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A cave or tomb (the "Grave" of the inscription) of stone

                        portion of the wall. The floor is visible below the figures. A table with a
                        cloth draped over it stands just below the window. A plate with bread or
                        other food and a glass goblet or chalice appear on the table; a shadow on
                        the goblet indicates that it is partially filled with liquid. The body of a
                        male figure lays supine on a mat or bed in the lower portion of the design;
                        the body is horizontal with the head to the left. He is identified in the
                        inscription as the "Good Old Man"; he is either dying or may be dead. The
                        figure has long hair and a beard. His eyes are closed. He is gowned and a
                        cloth veil or other drapery rests on his head. The figure's right arm is at
                        his side and his right hand holds or touches an open book; the right page of
                        the book has a clearly visible text or inscription which reads, "THE NEW
                        TESTAMENT." Seven figures appear around the old man, four at the head and
                        three at the feet. A gowned female kneels in the lower left corner. She is
                        seen from behind and faces to the right with her head turned slightly down;
                        she looks at the old man below. Her right arm is bent upward and the palm
                        may be held vertically; although her left arm is not pictured, she may be
                        praying. The upper body of a gowned female appears directly above the old
                        man's head. She may be kneeling or sitting. The figure faces left with her
                        head turned down; she looks at the face of the old man below. Both arms are
                        bent in front of her chest; her hands are together with the palms held
                        vertically in prayer. Two additional figures are visible to the left of the
                        corpse; they may be female. Both figures are positioned with their heads
                        down and their faces obscured. The figure directly above the old man's head
                        rests her hands on a pillow or bundle with the palms turned down. A gowned
                        male with short, curly hair kneels to the right of the old man. The figure's
                        left leg is bent; his right leg is not visible. He faces left in profile
                        with his head down. Both arms are bent in front of his chest with his hands
                        held together and the palms vertical; he may be praying. Two additional
                        figures appear to the right of the old man; both are positioned with their
                        faces obscured. The figure to the left may be seen from behind. A gowned
                        male with long hair and a beard flies or hovers between two winged angels in
                        the upper portion of the design; he probably represents the soul of the dead
                        or dying man below. His head is turned up with his eyes raised and his mouth
                        slightly opened. His hands are positioned to the right of his head with the
                        palms held together vertically; he is probably praying. The angel to the
                        right is seen from behind and faces away from the viewer. The angel to the
                        left has long curly hair and looks to the right toward the male spirit; the
                        lower half of the angel's face is obscured. The figures may rest on a large
                        cloud extending horizontally across the upper portion of the design; it
                        appears to pass through the open window.</illusobjdesc><component type="structure" location="E"><characteristic>room</characteristic><characteristic>wall</characteristic><characteristic>window</characteristic><characteristic>floor</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The scene takes place in a room with an open window on the

                        the design. The doorway is framed by two pillars supporting a lintel and a
                        single step below. There may be a path or road below the tomb, along the
                        lower border of the image. Leafy vegetation appears in the lower right
                        corner of the design along the right edge of the path or road. The door to
                        the tomb is open with a hinge visible along its right edge. Large straps,
                        possibly made of iron, secure the structure of the wooden(?) door. A
                        circular knocker or handle appears in the center of the door, and a keyhole
                        is visible below and to the left. The interior of the tomb is dark. A woven
                        matpossibly made of strawrests on a bed, bier, or raised platform in the
                        lower left corner of the tomb. An old man with long hair and a beard stands
                        in the lower portion of the design. The figure wears a belted gown and faces
                        left in profile. His left leg is bent with his left heel raised slightly.
                        His right leg is not pictured, but he likely steps up into the doorway. The
                        figure is hunched over and leans on a crutch positioned under his left arm.
                        The figure's left arm is bent at his side and he may hold or touch the
                        crutch with his left hand. The old man's long hair streams out to the left,
                        as though blown by a wind. A nude male with short curly hair sits or kneels
                        above the tomb. The figure faces forward with his head turned up and to the
                        right in profile. His mouth is open and his right eye is raised. Both legs
                        are bent; his left knee is on the ground and his right leg is drawn up. The
                        figure's left arm is at his side and is not visible below the elbow. His
                        right arm is bent back; his hand rests on the ground with the palm down and
                        he may be bracing or supporting himself. An aura surrounds the upper half of
                        the figure; beams of light radiate outward. Alternatively, the figure may be
                        positioned in front of the sun.</illusobjdesc><component type="structure" location="E"><characteristic>tomb</characteristic><characteristic>hill</characteristic><characteristic>stone</characteristic><characteristic>step</characteristic><characteristic>pillar</characteristic><characteristic>lintel</characteristic><characteristic>door</characteristic><characteristic>iron</characteristic><characteristic>wood</characteristic><characteristic>open</characteristic><characteristic>hinge</characteristic><characteristic>circle</characteristic><characteristic>handle</characteristic><characteristic>dark</characteristic><characteristic>bed</characteristic><characteristic>bier</characteristic><characteristic>mat</characteristic><characteristic>straw</characteristic><characteristic>coil</characteristic><characteristic>coiled</characteristic><characteristic>road</characteristic><characteristic>path</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A tomb is built into a large stone or hill in the lower
