            <updatestmt>
                The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of electronic editions of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> copies I, X, and Z from the Huntington Library and Art Gallery, National Gallery of Victoria, and the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Munich. They join copies B from the Library of Congress, G from the Yale Center for British Art, L from the Bodleian Library, and U from the Houghton Library.<lb/>
                <lb/>
                Blake etched the plates of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> in relief, with white-line work in some designs, on thirty-one plates in 1789, the date on the title page. In 1794, for the first copies of the combined <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi>, Blake moved “The Little Girl Lost” and “The Little Girl Found” (plates 34-36) from <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> to <hi rend="i">Experience</hi>. He moved “The School Boy” and “The Voice of the Ancient Bard” (plates 53, 54) from <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> to <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> in the last eight copies of <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>. Hence, Innocence evolved from its earliest autonomous copies with thirty-one plates to its last iteration as a twenty-six-plate section in the combined <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>.<lb/>
                <lb/>
                In <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> copy I, all thirty-one plates were printed in green and light blue inks, with several intermediate hues, on both sides of 17 leaves. The texts were given light washes, a style of coloring Blake began to use c. 1795, suggesting that this copy was colored later than the other 1789 copies, or refinished before it was sold. Copy I is unusual, though, in having all thirty-one plates that late; for <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> copy L, for example, also in the Archive, Blake had extracted plates 34-36, a sign that he had reconfigured and sold it after 1794. The color washes on some plates in copy I have faded badly due to overexposure to light.<lb/>
                <lb/>
                <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> copy I was printed in the same ink colors as—and presumably with—<hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> copy X and <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> of <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> copy F, which is in the Archive. <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> copy X is incomplete, with fourteen plates printed on seven leaves, but among them are plates 35 and 36, strongly suggesting that it had initially all thirty-one plates. An eighth leaf, with plates 9 and 10, is in the Fitzwilliam Museum. The simple washes in copy X exemplify Blake’s earliest style of illumination, with just a few light washes applied to the vignettes but the texts left untouched.<lb/>
                <lb/>
                <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> copy Z, also an early copy, was printed after the green issue in the raw sienna ink used for the sets of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> in <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> B, C, D, and E (all but copy D are in the Archive). Copy Z has twenty-seven of thirty-one plates; it is missing plates 27, 34, 35, and 36 printed on two leaves. The same leaves were extracted from <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> copy K, though copy K has plate 27, printed separately on one side of the leaf and added as its last plate. Copy Z is the only copy of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> numbered by Blake, which, along with the extracted plates, suggests that it was sold after 1795, when he began numbering his plates. It was acquired in the mid-nineteenth century for the library of Ludwig I of Bavaria.<lb/>
                <lb/>
                With the publication of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> copies I, X, and Z, the Archive now contains fully searchable and scalable electronic editions of ninety-eight copies of Blake's nineteen illuminated books in the context of full bibliographic information about each work, careful diplomatic transcriptions of all texts, detailed descriptions of all images, and extensive bibliographies. New protocols for transcription, which produce improved accuracy and fuller documentation in editors' notes, have been applied to all copies of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> in the Archive. With the Archive's Compare feature, users can easily juxtapose multiple impressions of any plate across all or selected copies of this or any of the other illuminated books and, with the Virtual Lightbox, users can examine any images in the Archive, as well as crop, zoom, and juxtapose them for close study.<lb/>
                <lb/>
                As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with the University of Rochester, the continuing support of the Library of Congress, and the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.

The leaves are presently loose; the plate order given here is the order in which the plates were bound from c. 1965-1988.  This copy is incomplete, as the presence of Bentley Plate 35 (the second plate of "The Little Girl Lost") without Bentley Plate 34 (the first plate of "The Little Girl Lost"), and the presence of Bentley Plate 23 (the second plate of "Spring") without Bentley Plate 22 (the first plate of "Spring") clearly indicate.  When issued by Blake, this copy probably contained the usual complement of 31 plates (2-27, 34-36, 53-54) found in complete copies of *Songs of Innocence* printed by Blake in 1789.  The time at which the missing plates were removed is unknown but must have been before 1941, when Geoffrey Keynes acquired impressions of Bentley Plates 9 and 10, printed recto/verso on a single leaf.  The leaf size, ink color, and pattern of stab holes indicate that this leaf, now in the Keynes Collection, Fitzwilliam Museum, was once part of copy X.</note>

                    <illusobjdesc>A serpentine plant-like structure with
flame-like leaves, apparently rooted at right in the strip of
grassy ground lower right, grows along the ground under the last stanza and then up
the left margin.  Between 
stanzas three and four the plant forks.  One part continues up the
left margin and ends under the 
title.  Another part of the plant curves between the third and
fourth stanzas and crosses into the 
right margin, curves back over the title and ends in an upward
flourish at top left.  The large plant 
is encircled in its upper reaches by a leafy vine that is rooted,
like the plant itself, at the bottom 
right corner.  From there the vine climbs up the right margin right
of the standing figure and then, 
after arching over the figure's head, onto the flame-like plant,
which the vine continues to climb, finally terminating just left of
the title.  A second vine, much shorter, appears in front of the
plant at the bottom of the plate, left of the reclining figure. 
There are several human 
figures on and around the plants: (at top left) a gowned female
with long hair walks right; a second gowned female with long hair
floats behind her, pointing right; two figures kneel side by side,
facing right, hands raised in prayer; (at bottom right) a gowned
figure stands, with an arm extended, perhaps touching the left hand
of a nude(?) male figure to the left, who reclines 
with his right arm braced for support, his left raised vertically;
below and in front of this pair, a 
third figure, perhaps a nude female, reclines, supported on her
left arm.</illusobjdesc>

a third figure, perhaps a nude female, reclines, supported on her
left arm.  Her body faces forward, and her head appears to be turned slightly to the right and down.  The male and female conceivably represent Adam and Eve;
the standing gowned figure may be Christ.</illusobjdesc>

that swirls in the spaces of the right margin (with a more
conventional leaf or two at bottom right), underneath the title,
and down the left margin.  Tendrils extending from both margins
help separate the stanzas from one another.  The vine right of the
final stanza on the plate has several loops suggesting a spiral. 
The vine full of leaves and flowers(?) that extends across the top
of the plate above the title and fills the top right corner and the
space right of the first stanza is distinct from the flame-like 
vegetation that dominates the rest of the plate.  Extensions of
letters in the title (line 1) contribute to both forms of vegetation: the
initial "A" and "C" to the vine above, the "S" to both.  In the
text of the poem, occasional letters have modest decorative
extensions, and there are a few bits of stray decorative
vegetation.</illusobjdesc>

The thin rim of a halo appears above his head.  If this is God, it is very probably Christ, given the similarities
between this figure and several of Blake's other representations of
Christ.  Both feet are exposed; his left 
foot is forward.  He looks down toward the boy.</illusobjdesc>

girl[?] and a boy) stretch something, perhaps a piece of cloth used
in a game, between them; a girl raises her arms horizontally and
faces right with legs outspread; a boy raises his arms 
higher, as does the long-haired(?) girl to the right of him, whose
leg is extended behind her; holding her hand, a boy runs left and reaches forward to hold the hand of
another running or striding boy, left leg extended behind him, who raises his free left hand as he
moves left and back, perhaps toward the opening between the pair furthest left.  All the girls
wear gowns; all the boys apparently wear tight-fitting garments, though the next-to-last boy appears to wear a shirt and breeches.  These are the "little ones" who "leaped &amp;
shouted &amp; laugh'd" (line 16) and remonstrate with the nurse in the poem.</illusobjdesc>

stanzas 2, 3, and 4 have extensions that add to the decoration in
the left margin.  Several human figures populate the network of interlinear vegetation: two on the "N" of "Nurse's," 
climbing the left stroke and 
sitting on a leaf at the end of the curling right stroke; one
reaching downward through the following "u," joining hands with another who reaches up from below; one leaning

                    <illusobjdesc>A lithe and leafy tree, rooted bottom right, grows up
the right edge of the plate.  A vine grows up around its trunk;
grape clusters are visible opposite stanzas 6 and 7.  At the
midway point the vine seems to produce the loopy tendril that terminates near the bird with long tail
feathers that ascends to the right of stanza 6.  Other birds fly to the right of lines 3, 6, and 12.  The
letters of the title are ornamented with elaborate extensions and
flourishes.  The three capital letters, along with the "h" of
"Anothers," which is decorated with a kind of forked top
above and a long flag below, and the coil following the final "w,"
are the most notable.  The left margin is dominated by a lattice of
branches from two thin trees rooted at bottom left.  Leafless below, the branches in the upper reaches of the margin
carry the suggestion of leaves, and there are very loopy tendrils
beside the first three stanzas that may be a separate vine or part
of the tree.  A figure playing a pipe stands next to the right
tree, lower left.  At the piper's feet is an indistinct shape, possibly a dog(?).  There is a second figure climbing in the
branches above, opposite stanza 7.  There may also be a third
figure with arms raised, opposite stanzas 2 and 3, although the
figure merges with the tendrils in this copy.  A fourth human form,
left of stanza 1, stands facing right with at least one arm raised. 
A narrow band of green wash suggests grassy ground just above the
bottom of the plate.  The background of the plate is colored to suggest a sky, possibly at sunrise or sunset and with a few clouds.</illusobjdesc>

figure, facing left, stands at the base of the tree on the left and
plays a pipe.  A second figure climbs in the branches above,
opposite stanza 7.  A third, opposite stanzas 2 and 3, raises his
arms as if in supplication--although in this copy the figure is
hard to separate from the vines.  The final figure, clearly
represented left of stanza 1, stands facing right with at least one
arm raised vertically.</illusobjdesc>

the vine seems to produce the loopy tendril that terminates near

7.  The letters of the title are ornamented with elaborate extensions
and flourishes.  The three capital letters, along with the "h" of
"Anothers," which is decorated with a kind of forked top above and a long flag below,
and the coil following the final "w," are the most notable.  In the
left margin is a lattice of branches from two thin trees rooted at
bottom left.  Leafless below, the branches in the upper reaches of
the margin carry the suggestion of leaves, and there are very loopy
tendrils beside the first three stanzas that may be a separate vine
or part of the tree.</illusobjdesc>

vegetation, animals, birds, and human figures.  The block letters
of the title are surrounded by vine-like loops and flame-like leaves (attached to the "H" and "L" of "HOLY" and the "S" and "Y"
of "THURSDAY" [line 1]) and combinations of those with other long-leaved
plants (especially under the title).  Many of the
letters of the long-lined poem have decorative vine-like
extensions.  After the area around the title, the most extravagant decoration is reserved for the spaces between

"their" in line 10) or human figures (e.g., on the sprig of
vegetation beneath the "Y" of "HOLY") but are more likely to be

harp, before an audience of perhaps two children--standing in the middle of the group--and six older youths.  He may be the bard of the title.  To the left stand two young females who embrace.  To the right stand the two children and a group of three gowned females who face the bard.  At their feet, facing them, kneels another female.  All the figures appear to be gowned.  The
scene is set outdoors on a strip of slightly inclined grassy ground with a dark shadow lower right.  A palm-like frond arches over the head of the figure at far right and the vine in the left margin
of the text dangles down into this major design above the heads of
the embracing couple.  Background washes suggest sky, possibly at sunset or sunrise with a cloud on the left.</illusobjdesc>
