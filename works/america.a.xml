            <seriesstmt>The William Blake Archive</seriesstmt>
            <updatestmt>The editors of the William Blake Archive are pleased to announce the publication of seven new electronic editions of Blake's illuminated books. They are: 
                <hi rend="i">The [First] Book of Urizen</hi>
                Copy G, 
                <hi rend="i">The Book of Los</hi>
                Copy A, 
                <hi rend="i">The Book of Ahania</hi>
                Copy A, 
                <hi rend="i">The Song of Los</hi>
                Copy B, 
                <hi rend="i">America, a Prophecy</hi>
                Copy A, 
                <hi rend="i">Europe, a Prophecy</hi>
                Copy E, and 
                <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi>
                Copy F.
                <lb/>
                <lb/>
                We had announced 
                <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi>
                Copy G as forthcoming two months ago, but formatting the double-columned text diplomatically in SGML for both Netscape and Internet Explorer proved more taxing and time consuming than anticipated. Such are the joys and tribulations of electronic publishing. Solving the problems there, though, ensured diplomatic transcriptions for Blake's other books with double-columned texts, 
                <hi rend="i">The Book of Ahania</hi>
                and 
                <hi rend="i">The Book of Los</hi>
                . Together, these three works are often referred to as Blake's Bible of Hell or, simply, the Urizen books. 
                <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi>
                , of which there are only seven extant copies, was first produced in 1794, color printed to form Copies A, C, D, E (untraced), F, and J. It was printed again in 1795 to form Copy B, which was produced as part of a set of illuminated books printed on large paper, and then one last time in c. 1818 to form Copy G, which was produced in Blake's late printing and coloring style. The editors are currently working on Copies A, B, C, and F and expect to have them in the Archive by the end of the year. 
                <hi rend="i">The Book of Ahania</hi>
                and 
                <hi rend="i">The Book of Los</hi>
                exist in unique copies, with only a few proof impressions extant. They were printed in 1795 and executed in intaglio instead of in relief etching, the technique Blake normally used for his illuminated books. Although their texts are printed in intaglio, their frontispieces are beautifully color printed from the surface of the plates.
                <lb/>
                <lb/>
                With 
                <hi rend="i">The Song of Los</hi>
                , which consists of two parts entitled &quot;Africa&quot; and &quot;Asia,&quot; we complete Blake's other series of illuminated books, sometimes known as the Continental Prophecies, begun in 1793 with 
                <hi rend="i">America</hi>
                and continued in 1794 with 
                <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>
                . The copy of 
                <hi rend="i">The Song of Los</hi>
                included here is one of six extant; all were color printed in the same printing session in 1795.
                <lb/>
                <lb/>
                With fourteen complete copies extant, 
                <hi rend="i">America</hi>
                is not as rare as these other illuminated books, but Copy A, which was printed and colored in 1795 as part of Blake's large-paper set of books, is, along with Copies K, O, and M, one of only four colored copies—and it was the model for Copy K. Moreover, only it and Copy O have the last four lines on Plate 4, which was masked in the printing of the other copies. The Archive will include Copies M and O (c. 1807 and 1818) later this year.
                <lb/>
                <lb/>
                Only nine copies of 
                <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>
                are extant, and only two of those, Copies H and O (1795 and 1818), have Plate 3, the Preludium. The Archive will include both of these Copies by the end of the year. Copy E, included here, was lightly color printed on both sides of the paper in 1794 and joins Copy B, color printed more heavily on one side of the paper the same year.
                <lb/>
                <lb/>
                <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi>
                Copy F is an exquisitely beautiful copy, heavily color printed (especially its frontispiece) in c. 1794, and never before reproduced. It joins Copies C and J (both 1793), and will be joined later this year by Copies G and P (1795 and 1818).
                <lb/>
                <lb/>
                All of these editions have newly edited texts; all images in the editions were scanned from either 4x5 or 8x10 transparencies, nearly all of which were made specifically for the Archive. Like our other editions, these are all SGML-encoded, fully searchable for both text and images and supported by the unique Inote and ImageSizer applications described in our previous updates.
                <lb/>
                <lb/>
                The Archive now contains sixteen copies of ten illuminated books. In the coming months, we will be adding copies of 
                <hi rend="i">All Religions are One</hi>
                , 
                <hi rend="i">There is No Natural Religion</hi>
                , 
                <hi rend="i">For the Sexes</hi>
                , 
                <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>
                , and 
                <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>
                , along with copies of books already in the Archive but from different printings. Our goal is to have the entire illuminated canon online this year. In addition, work continues on the SGML edition of David V. Erdman's 
                <hi rend="i">Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</hi>
                , which we anticipate releasing sometime this spring.</updatestmt>

                    <illusobjdesc>The design embodies the destructiveness of warfare. In the middle distance is a
stone wall with, on the right, the
fragments of a top carved with classical motifs.  A great gap
appears to the left, and in this gap sits a giant winged figure. 
He is nude and muscular, with prominent knees and feet and both
arms shackled and chained to the ground or to the remnants of the wall on which he
squats or sits.  His legs are drawn up in an extremely contracted
posture, with his knees to his shoulders.  His head is lowered and
rests on his knees; his face is not pictured.  His hair is long and
curly.  The contracted posture and lowered head suggest despair. 
He may be Albion's Angel, the representative of the establishment
forces, or Orc, the personification of revolution.  To the right
is a family group, all nude.  A woman, very probably a mother,
sits on a fragment of the stone wall.  Her hair is long and her
face expresses a brooding fear, despair, or simply exhaustion. 
She holds in her lap a young child, probably male.  He
faces forward but perhaps looks up toward the woman.  His
(right?) knee is prominent.  Another child, of uncertain gender,
leans against the woman's left thigh and hip and hides his or her
head below the woman's left arm.  This figure's legs are crossed
at the ankles.  We see this figure from behind.  On the ground
below the woman is the haft of a broken sword, and further to the
left is a dismounted cannon.  The sky is dominated by dark
clouds, perhaps of smoke.  Touches of red on the edges of the clouds suggest a sunrise, sunset, or distant fire.  A dark shadow cuts diagonally across the wall right of the woman,
rising from left to right.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The lowest part of the design is formed of male
corpses stacked like cord wood.  We see, on the first level of
the stack, the tops of the heads and horizontally-extended arms
of two rigid bodies lying prone.  The next layer is a single
rigid body, lying supine, with his legs extended to the right and
his arms at his side.  He faces up.  Above him is a gowned woman
with long hair, lying on top of him with her left leg drawn up
and her right leg extended.  She embraces the man around the neck
with her left arm.  Her face, seen in profile, touches the dead
or dying man's face below her; she may be kissing him, trying to
resuscitate him, or simply mourning over him.  Her mouth is partly open.  The dark sky above
these figures contains a few diagonal white lines that may
indicate rain or sleet descending from the clouds above.  These
large clouds bear the title, as though inscribed upon them, and
six figures.  On the left, a gowned woman with long hair sits
with right leg extended before her and her left leg bent back
behind her.  She faces and hunches over to the left, apparently
holding a book or tablet also being looked at or read by a gowned
child, probably male, with curly hair.  He stands before the
woman and faces right, but is probably looking down at the book
or tablet.  At least his right arm is extended horizontally and
may rest on the book or tablet.  Behind the woman is another
figure, perhaps nude and female, sitting with legs extended and
her back leaning against the back of the woman.  Although the
scale of the figures is uncertain, this may be a child or young
girl.  Another group of three figures is on the right.  An old,
bearded man with long hair sits facing to the right.  He wears a
heavy gown and hunches over a book or tablet on his lap, at which
he appears to be looking and perhaps reading.  His posture is
contracted, in contrast to the figure to the right—a nude female
hovering in the air.  We see her from behind; her posture is
gracefully twisted.  Her left arm is raised horizontally, her
right arm at 135 degrees.  The index finger on her right hand
points upward.  Her right leg is extended, her left drawn up.  Her hair is
in a bun.  Behind the old man is a nude male, youthful and facing
to the right although his body is turned to the left and leans
against the back of the old man.  His legs are crossed and he
points upward and to the left with his right arm, hand, and
extended index finger at an angle of 135 degrees.  His left arm
is bent and supported against the old man's back.  Although these
two nude figures are much smaller than the old man, they are
probably not children but energetic representations of spiritual
states unperceived, or ignored, by the old man.  The two large
figures with books or tablets have sometimes been identified as a
sibyl and a prophet.  Alternatively, the male may be a
priest.  The area at the bottom of the plate, below the imprint, contains washes that may indicate a
landscape with low hills.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Although the plate contains considerable text, it
appears as though the plate is treated as a single design
extending across the top one third, down the left margin, and
across the lower margin.  A large tree, perhaps an oak, with
arching branches dominates the top left of the design.  The
vegetation right of the large trunk may be a separate
bush.  Below and to the right of its trunk is an
earthen bank (colored green, thereby indicating grass or perhaps moss) to which is shacked a
nude, youthful male by both hands and feet.  His arms are spread
out horizontally on the rock, as if crucified; his legs are also
spread apart.  His torso and neck are twisted, perhaps in pain;
he faces up.  His mouth is open; he may be speaking or crying in
pain.  His hair is curly; he is probably Orc, the spirit of
revolution here restrained.  To the right are a nude male and
female, both standing.  The female, with legs spread apart,
grasps her head with both hands, as if in mourning or despair. 
We do not see her face, but her upper torso is twisted to the
left—toward the shackled youth.  She may be Enitharmon, Orc's
mother.  Further to the right, the male stands with legs spread
apart.  His body faces us, but he turns his head to the left and
may be looking at the shackled youth.  His arms, with elbows
bent, are raised over his head, with his hands raised, palms out,
and the fingers of both hands spread apart.  His hair is spiky or
flame-like; his general expression is one of horror or grief. 
His mouth is slightly open; he may be speaking or crying out in
sorrow.  This may be Los, Orc's father.  Alternatively, the
couple has been identified as Adam and Eve, or as the &quot;Dark
virgin&quot; and Urthona (another name for Los) mentioned on this
plate (lines 12, 2).  The roots of the tree descend through the left
margin, perhaps taking on anthropomorphic shapes.  At the end of
the roots, in the far lower left corner of the plate, sits or
squats a nude, youthful male in a severely contracted posture. 
His legs are drawn up, with his head resting on his knees.  He
faces forward, with a grim expression, and holds his crossed
hands over his ankles.  His hair is curly or flame-like.  This
may be another representation of Orc, as the personification of
underground forces of revolution now enclosed but with the
potential to break out.  A reticulated worm, with six loops,
fills the lower margin.  The loops suggest (although they do not
quite form) a spiral.</illusobjdesc>

faces us, but his head is turned to the left and may be looking
at the shackled youth.  His arms, with elbows bent, are raised
over his head, with his hands raised, palms out, and the fingers
of both hands spread apart.  His hair is curly or flame-like; his
general expression is one of horror or grief.  His mouth is
slightly open; he may be speaking or crying out in sorrow.  This
may be Los, Orc's father, but he has also been identified as
Urthona (another name for Los, mentioned on this plate in lines 2 and 17) and as
Adam.</illusobjdesc>

filling the lower third of the plate and continuing up the left

and foot are prominent; his hands are placed on the ground and
his arms, bent sharply at the elbows, seem to be pushing him
upward.  He looks up and to the right.  This is probably Orc.  To
the left are a good many roots, as though we could see below the
surface of the earth.  Above these roots is a large plant growing
up the left margin.  It bears two large leaves and a long branch
that terminates in a grain tassel.  To the left of this plant is
a vine that forms a long, vertical spiral.  There are a few small
plants and tufts of grass right of the nude male and left and
right of the large plant.  Colors indicating radiance emanate from
the lower right.  These suggest a sunrise or sunset, with its beams of light extending upward
through the text.  The yellow, disc-like area from which the radiance emanates suggests the sun.  Blue washes along the top margin of the plate suggest clouds.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The area above the text bearing the heading (&quot;A /

extended wings; three of these seem to be soaring upwards.  Upper
left, a nude, muscular male also seems to be ascending.  He has
apparently broken free of the chains that still dangle from his
wrists.  His right arm is at his side; his left arm is bent back
over his left shoulder.  His left leg is bent behind him; we see
only the left ankle and foot.  His hair may be curly.  He faces
forward with his head tilted up.  This may be another representation of Orc or,
more generally, humanity freed from its chains by revolution. 
The words of the heading are integrated into vegetative design
motifs, including several vines with leaves, spiraling vines
growing from the first and last letters of &quot;PROPHECY&quot; (line 3), and grain
stems and tassels growing from the first word of the heading
(&quot;A&quot;) (line 2).  Background washes hint at clouds tinged with rose by the fires in the design below or by a sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Between lines 8 and 9 of the text, a hovering nude
male, perhaps an apocalyptic angel of the last trump, holds with
both hands and blows into a large trumpet.  We see him from
behind; his hair is long and streams to the left, as though blown
by a wind.  Issuing from the mouth of the trumpet is a great
blast of fire that turns upward in the left margin of the plate. 
Below, and evidently part of the same design, are further flames and smoke,
including a line of fire between lines 15 and 17 of the text.  In
the lower left corner of the plate is a nude family group fleeing
from the fires above and behind them.  The male (father?) is in
the middle; he holds the hand of a young boy on the left.  He strides forward with his left
leg and looks back at the flames.  His hair may be curly.  The
woman (mother?) strides forward with her right leg, also turns back to the
flames, and raises her left arm over her head.  The fingers of
her left hand are spread apart.  The boy on the left strides
forward with his left leg, also seems to be looking back, and
raises his right arm over his head.  All three figures stride
over a small mound of earth or hill.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Although the plate contains considerable text, it
would appear that the pictorial image is treated as a full-plate
design.  At top right, just below line 2, is a
winged dragon of a type traditionally called a wyvern.  The
creature is apparently flying through the air.  It faces to the
left, with a coiled or spiral tail with one loop on the right. 
Its skin looks scaly and its face is somewhat dog-like, with a
partly opened mouth and large teeth.  The top of its head bears a
crest.  Its front paws look almost like human hands.  Below and
to the left of its left paw is a jagged line, perhaps
representing a bolt of lightning.  Further to the left, and
descending into the left margin, is an old man.  His gown forms a
long, snake-like tail behind him, rather like the wyvern's tail. 
He has a long beard and long hair.  His right arm is at his side,
but we can see that, with his right hand, he grasps a large book
or tablet.  His left arm reaches downward and he holds in his
left hand a scepter or spear with a fleur-de-lis point.  This
figure may be Albion's Angel or Urizen (twice referred to in the
text) with his book of laws.  Below this descending figure is
another jagged line, perhaps representing lightning, and several
cloud outlines extending to the right margin above the last two lines of text.  Red wash suggests a sunrise or sunset just above the clouds and below the words &quot;not
light&quot; in line 12.  Below these billowing clouds, in the plate's lower
margin, is a landscape that includes three figures, probably a
family group of father, mother, and child.  Lower left is the
trunk of a large tree, fallen on the ground to the left.  On the
right, behind the figure group, is another fallen tree with a heavy limb extending upward and
toward the right margin.  The
male is the left-most figure in the group, lower right.  He is
nude and squats or kneels on the ground, with his upper body bent
forward.  Both arms are raised and bent at the elbows; he grasps
his head with both hands.  This gesture, and his crude facial
features, express despair or terror.  To the right is a crouching
female.  She may be gowned or nude.  Her left knee and foot are
prominent.  She turns her head to the right; we cannot see her
face because it is covered by the head of a child of uncertain
gender she embraces.  This child is standing and may be gowned,
although we can see little of this figure beyond the left side of
his or her head and the left leg.  These two figures seem to be
seeking protection in each other's arms.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Although containing considerable text, the plate is
treated as a full-plate design with six nude and muscular male
figures.  Top left is a man hovering horizontally in the air in
front of a cloud.  His left leg extends back and up behind him;
his left arm extends out to the right and he points in that
direction with his left index finger.  In his right hand he holds
large scales (or, more precisely, a pair of balances), perhaps to
be associated with the Day of Judgement.  This figure may be a
personification of Justice.  He has long hair and looks up and to
the right at the pair of figures to his right.  The lower man in
this pair seems to be standing, with one leg bent and one
extended, on the outline of the cloud.  He is bent over, with his
face hidden.  His hair is curly.  With both arms bent at the
elbows and extended over his head he carries on his back another
nude male.  This figure, in an extremely contracted posture, has
his arms clasped behind his back, both legs drawn up, and his
head and upper body bent over so that his head seems to touch his
groin or left thigh.  Perhaps we are to think that the man
holding this figure is about to cast him into the abyss.  Further
to the right, but still above the text area, is another nude
figure with long hair that forms loops.  In spite of this
feature, the musculature suggests a male.  We see him from
behind, floating vertically in the air, with legs slightly
spread.  His left arm is raised, his right is lowered, but he
grasps with both hands a giant sword with flames emanating from
its edge and trailing off to the right, as though blown by a
wind.  The arm position suggests that he may be sheathing the
sword, although no sheath is clearly pictured.  This figure,
perhaps another personification of Justice, looks to the right. 
Below the text are large tongues of flame with accompanying smoke, perhaps suggesting
hell.  Just above or within these fires are two more nude males.  The
figure on the left hovers horizontally in the air, although he
may be falling into the flames below.  His hair is curly.  His
knees are drawn up toward his torso and he grasps the back of his
head with both hands and faces down.  This gesture suggests
despair.  To the right is a male falling head-first.  His knees
are sharply bent and he too seems to grasp his head with both
hands.  Around him circles a giant snake, with open mouth and a
forked tongue.  Below the human figure, the snake's tail forms a
spiral into which the man may be falling.  The skin of the snake
is scaly.</illusobjdesc>

loops, the musculature suggests another male.  We see him from
behind, hovering vertically in the air, with legs slightly
spread.  His left arm is raised, his right is lowered, but he
grasps with both hands a giant sword with flames emanating from
its edge and trailing off to the right, as though blown by a
wind.  The arm position suggests that he may be sheathing the
sword, although no sheath is clearly pictured.  This figure,
perhaps another personification of Justice, looks to the
right.</illusobjdesc>

His legs are bent at the knees, with thighs spread apart (clearly
revealing his genitals) and his feet below the center of his

the ground for support (we see only his right hand on the
ground).  His hair is curly.  His body is slightly twisted as he
faces up and to the right.  He may be in the act of rising from
the ground.  Behind are clouds; the earth below may be a small
hill or mound covered with grass or moss.  Below his right foot and on the right are several
leaves, perhaps oak or grape leaves.  A vine-like plant with leaves and
perhaps flowers decorates the right side of the mound and
descends into the right margin of the text.  There may also be a
few tufts of grass on the far right side of the mound.  On the
left is a skull, facing skyward.  This motif suggests that the
male may be sitting on a grave—perhaps his own, from which he is
rising.  Far left are a few tufts of grass and another vine
dangling down the left margin of the text; it bears large leaves
(perhaps grape).</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Although the plate contains seven lines of text, the
pictorial image is treated as a full-plate design.  The landscape
below the text includes, on the left, a large tree, perhaps a
birch or willow, growing up the left margin.  Its long, slender
branches and leaves (or perhaps catkins) arch over the text. 
Three birds, two with long, forked tails, are perched on the
branches.  Three other birds fly in the air, plus a winged insect
(perhaps a moth or butterfly).  The landscape below includes
grass and two large leaves.  The leaf on the left, near the tree,
has a vine-like stem; this may be a grape vine.  The leaf in the
lower right corner might be either a grape or oak leaf.  Lying on
the grass is a ram, facing right, apparently asleep.  A young boy
or male child rests his arms and head on the ram's back; his feet
(or at least one foot) can be seen right of the ram's head.  This boy has curly hair and
is probably also sleeping.  Below the ram, another youth, but of
uncertain gender, is stretched on the grass, perhaps asleep.  We
see this nude figure from behind.  The figure's left leg is
extended, the right bent at the knee.  The figure's head lies on
his or her right arm; we see only the top of the figure's head
and long hair.  Water appears below the figures, just above the bottom margin of the plate; this
may be a river or lake.  The coloring of the sky suggests a sunrise or sunset behind the sheep. 
Radiant beams of light extend upward to the branches above the text.  This gentle, pastoral scene
contrasts sharply
with the apocalyptic tone of the text on the plate.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Although the plate contains a good deal of text,
Blake treated the pictorial image as a full-plate design.  Above,
an old, bearded, and gowned man sits among clouds.  His long hair
cascades over his left shoulder.  He faces forward, but looks
slightly to the left.  His arms are raised horizontally; his
hands seem to be holding the clouds on which they rest, palms down.  His
right leg is drawn up toward his chest in a contracted posture;
the right knee and foot are prominent.  His left leg is not
pictured.  The lines below his right foot may be a fold of his garment, but possibly a sandal.  This figure is very probably Urizen.  At the bottom of
the plate is a dark and stormy sea with waves.  The text panel is
shaped in such a way as to suggest a cloud between the upper and
lower parts of the design, although in this copy the blue tinting suggests that this might be a break between clouds.  The design, particularly the figure,
offers a contrasting parallel to the design on plate
12.</illusobjdesc>

His long hair cascades over his left shoulder.  He faces forward,
but looks slightly to the left.  His arms are raised
horizontally; his hands seem to be holding the clouds on which
they rest, palms down.  The visible fingers on his hands are spread apart.  His right leg is drawn up toward his chest in a
contracted posture; the right knee and foot are prominent.  His
left leg is not pictured.  The lines below his right foot may be a fold of his garment, but possibly a sandal.  This is probably Urizen.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Although the plate contains considerable text, the
pictorial image is treated as a full-plate design.  Below the
text, a nude, muscular, youthful male rises among flames.  His
hair is curly and snake-like; his mouth is open.  He faces forward, but looks
slightly to the left.  His left leg is bent at the knee, as
though he were stepping up and rising; his right leg is covered
by flames.  This figure is very probably Orc, the spirit of
revolution.  His arms are raised horizontally, with his hands
resting on the flames.  The visible fingers of both hands are spread
apart; both hands are poised as though the man was calling forth
the flames that surround him.  One tongue of flame, added in this copy with water color and
perhaps pen and ink, extends over his torso from left to right and rises above his left shoulder.
These flames (of hell?) and accompanying smoke extend up the left margin almost to the top of
the plate and appear in
the spaces between the text, particularly between lines 5 and 6. 
The design offers a contrasting parallel to the design on plate
10.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Although the plate contains considerable text, the
pictorial image is treated as a full page design.  Given the presence of
stars and a crescent moon, this is a night scene.  The sky is filled
with clouds and the text panel is also shaped like a cloud.  High in the
sky, but below line 4, a giant swan flies on
extended wings to the right.  A youthful nude male rides on his back.
The figure's legs are spread apart and dangle on each side of the swan's
back just in front of its wings.  The youth's is blown to the left by the onward flight of the bird.  The figure
looks back to the left, away from the direction of flight, and braces
himself with his right arm.  His left arm is raised horizontally and he
holds in his left hand a rein attached to the swan's beak. This figure
has sometimes been identified as Boston's Angel, although the reason for
this may be nothing more than the fact that he is named in the text
immediately above the figure (line 4).  To the right of the swan are four much
smaller birds, all flying on extended wings.  The largest of these has a
forked tail.  Below, and to the left of the text panel, are seven or eight stars; seven of them may be a constellation, the Pleiades.  Below the text, but still
in the night sky, are two more flying birds and, on the right, the
crescent moon and a single star (or perhaps the planet Venus).  The
earth appears only along the lower margin; the green coloring indicates
grass and a small plant in the lower right corner.  Three nude children
ride on the back of a snake.  The front-most child, perhaps a girl with
long hair, holds a pair of reins in her left hand that extends to the
snake's open mouth.  It's forked tongue is prominent and at least one
horn extends back from its head.  The second child, further to the left,
appears to be a male.  He braces himself with his left arm, perhaps
holding on to the snake with his left hand, and reaches back with his
right arm to hold hands with the very young child or infant nearest the
snake's tail.  This child reaches up, perhaps with both hands, but faces
to the right and may be looking down.  The right-most child has her legs
together; the others have their legs spread on each side of the snake
(although we see only their right legs).  The snake's body forms a loop
left of the children and terminates in two more loops and a single tail
(two were eliminated in this, the second state of the
plate).</illusobjdesc>

swan's back.  The figure's legs are spread apart and they dangle
on each side of the swan's back just in front of its wings.  The
youth's hair is blown to the left by the onward flight of the bird.  The figure looks back to the left, away from
the direction of flight, and braces himself with his right arm. 
His left arm is raised horizontally and he holds in his left hand
a rein attached to the swan's beak.  This figure has sometimes
been identified as Boston's Angel, although the reason for this
may be nothing more than the fact that he is named in the text
immediately above the figure (line 4).</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Although containing considerable text, the plate is
treated as a full-page design.  Lower left, an old man enters a
tomb.  The post and lintel doorway, very probably built of
stones, makes the tomb look like the entrance to a mine shaft.  The lintel is extended, through
hand coloring, into lines 13-16.
The heavy wooden door is partly open, revealing within darkness
and, lower left, either another stone or perhaps the edge of a
bier.  The old, bearded man wears a heavy gown; his prominent
left foot can be seen under the hem.  He faces, and is probably
walking, to the left—into the tomb.  He is bent over and leans
on a crutch held in his left hand and propped beneath his left
armpit.  His hair appears to be blown by a wind from right to
left, and hence towards the tomb entrance.  To the right of the
tomb is the trunk of a massive tree with a root extending along
the ground to the right.  The tree apparently continues behind
the tomb and then grows above it, where we see more of the trunk,
one large, leafless branch that arches over the text, and the
leaves from another branch.  Behind and to the right of the lower
trunk of the tree is a form that is probably another tree trunk.  Further to the right below the text
is a dark and stormy
sky with heavy clouds.  A few vague forms on the horizon may be
trees.  Green coloring in the foreground suggests grass.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Although the plate contains considerable text, the
pictorial image is treated as a full-page design showing the
surface and bottom of the sea.  The gray-green tinting of the text area makes it appear to be part of
the water.  Above the text, the limp body of
a nude female lies supine on a stony shore, with her legs on the
right extending into the waves of the sea.  Her head is bent back
and her long hair descends below, as does her dangling right arm. 
She is probably dead, perhaps from drowning.  A plant with spiky leaves and a vine grow left of the woman's head.  A large bird, very
probably an eagle, is perched on her right upper leg.  The
eagle's wings are extended and his curved beak seems to be thrust
into the woman's abdomen.  The bird may be eating the corpse;
indeed, a triangular form below his beak may be a piece of her
flesh.  The sky behind the bird is filled with clouds; the sea on
the right (perhaps the Atlantic, named several times in the text)
is stormy.  Below the text we see the dark waters of the deep and
the bottom of the sea.  Upon it lies supine a nude male, with his
knees bent slightly and his left arm at his side.  His body is
emaciated and rigid; he is no doubt dead, probably from drowning. 
We can see his ribs and his fingers look skeletal, perhaps
because the sea creatures around him have been eating his flesh. 
These include one large fish and two small ones, all with their
mouths open.  A sea snake coils itself around the man's legs;
another snake hovers above his chest.  Five much smaller fish
appear immediately below the text and in the right margin
following lines 18 and 19.  Below the man, on the
floor of the sea, are two further sea snakes or worms.  Near the lower right corner is a large,
spiral shell, probably a whelk (common to the Atlantic).  In the
far lower right corner is a minimally-representational form that
may be another shell.  Vegetation rises in the left margin of the
text almost touching the female figure on the rocky shore.  This
vegetation may be seaweed.  The twisted lines include, left of
lines 6-9 of the text, a snake with
open mouth.</illusobjdesc>

the text, but the roots of the large tree descend to the lower
margin and its branches extend to the top.  Thus, one must view
the entire plate to see all elements of the design.  Under the
arching and leafless branches of this tree sits a figure,
probably female.  Immediately behind her may be the trunk of a
second large tree.  She is nude except for a long scarf she wears
over her head; it trails on the ground to the right.  Her legs
are spread apart and bent at the knees, with her lower legs and
feet drawn up near her thighs.  She looks to the left toward the
second figure in the design.  Her left arm is braced next to her
torso, with the left hand on the ground.  Her right arm is extended horizontally, 
with the palm of her right hand facing down and her fingers (except for her downward-pointing thumb) pointing towards the other figure.  She may be a
sibyl or priestess.  Between her legs is a coiled snake, with its
head also directed at the second figure.  The snake's mouth is
open and its forked tongue is prominent.  To the left is a young
male with curly hair.  He wears either a short gown or tights. 
He is seated on the ground, with his legs extended to the left
and his upper body raised and twisted so that he faces right and
looks toward the other figure.  His hands are together in an
attitude of prayer or supplication.  His elbows are propped on a
stack of two large books (or a tablet and a book on top).  He may be a student or acolyte of the
priestess.  The sky behind the figures is filled with clouds.</illusobjdesc>

see a female figure from behind.  Her arms, raised vertically, vegetate into
vines or the limbs of trees; her feet are becoming roots.  This
transformation suggests the classical myth of Daphne.  The green coloring on her body may
signify tights or perhaps simply her vegetative character.  Her legs
are together and she faces to the right.  The vegetation
or limb extending from her right arm bears two figures: a seated
adult, probably female, facing left and holding a child or infant
who stands on her lap.  Left of the Daphne-figure's left leg is
another small figure, probably a female child.  This figure faces up and reaches up with at least
her right arm. 
This arm may be vegetating, as with the major figure.  The green coloring on her body may signify
tights or simply her vegetative nature.  Left of
this small figure is a vine with one loop.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Five nude female figures appear in flames in the
design below the text.  On the left, a female with legs slightly
spread appears to be hovering in the flames or rising through
them.  Her arms are at her side; her long hair cascades over both
shoulders.  She is facing up and to the left.  In the middle of
the design is a group of three embracing females.  The largest
sits or squats, facing right but with her head lowered.  She has
long hair.  We cannot see her face or arm positions.  In her lap
lies another nude female embracing the seated figure around her
waist with her left arm, raised horizontally.  Her body is
twisted and her face is also hidden.  The right-most figure in
the group is facing forward; her face is covered by her long hair.  She may be sitting or standing with a slight bend in her
legs.  Her left arm is extended horizontally.  To the right
of this group is another nude female in an extremely contracted
posture, facing left.  Her legs are drawn up with her knees to
her chest.  Her upper body leans forward over her raised knees
and her left arm partly encircles her lowered head and long hair. 
Between the ascending figure on the left and the group of three
females is a large grape leaf, a spiraling grape vine, and a
large cluster of grapes.  Above the group of three is another
spiraling grape vine.  The fires may be both the &quot;flames of Orc&quot; (line 14) and the &quot;fires of hell&quot; (line 18); the dark coloring at the tips of the flames suggests smoke.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The text includes, between its lines and in the
right margin, a great many interlinear motifs.  Most of these
take the form of vines or other vegetation; only the most
significant of these will be recorded here.  Above the second
word (&quot;Albions&quot;) in line 2, a bird flies upward on extended
wings.  The first letter of the first word in line 3 grows into a
vine, perhaps with leaves.  Line 4 is preceded by a
horse running or leaping to the left.  Following &quot;Bristols&quot; (line 4) are
the following, reading left to right: a vine with a standing
figure facing left, perhaps looking at a very small figure
looking right with arms raised horizontally; a vine with a seated
figure facing right; a flock of birds; a vine with perhaps a dog
standing on it, facing left (and barking at the birds?); a vine
with a standing figure facing left with at least one arm raised
horizontally; a small bird and a large bird (an eagle?) flying
upward; a tree trunk with one bare branch; a figure striding to
the left, at least one arm raised vertically, holding something
(perhaps a child?) in his or her raised hand.  Two birds fly on extended wings above &quot;And cast&quot; in line 8.  Following the word
&quot;mail,&quot; at the end of line 7, is another series of very small motifs.  These are,
from left to right: a leafless tree; a minimally representational
form that may be a figure sitting on the ground with one arm
propping up the upper body; two figures facing each other,
perhaps coming together to embrace or to fight; a vine with one
leaf; a vine with two loops and one leaf; a vine-like form with a
figure above it, striding and facing to the left with at least
one arm raised horizontally; a vine bearing, and arching over, a
figure lying on it and facing left.  Following line 9 is a vine,
growing from the second letter of &quot;chattering&quot; in line 10,
and a hovering figure, with legs spread, facing to the left and
holding to his or her mouth (and thus playing?) a trumpet or horn
of some sort.  A vine with two loops extends to the left from the
first letter of &quot;hills,&quot; line 13.  At the end of line 13, a
twisting vine appears above the final word (&quot;sky&quot;).  A tassel of
grain grows from the final letter of &quot;sky.&quot;  Between lines 13 and
14 are several motifs.  From left to right these are a vine with
two loops growing from the first letter of &quot;The&quot; at the beginning
of line 14; a very small figure striding to the right, with at
least one arm raised horizontally, on top of the first letter of
the first word in line 14; two vines, one with two loops; a small
bird flying; a seated human figure with knees bent, at least one
arm raised horizontally, and facing to the left; a vine with
leaves growing from the &quot;d&quot; of &quot;winds&quot; in line 14; a vine or
grain tassel growing from the first letter of &quot;driven&quot; in line
14; and a bird flying on extended wings above &quot;flames&quot; in line
14.  A vine, with flowers or leaves, descends from the last
letter of &quot;scales,&quot; line 22 of the text.  Birds fly on extended
wing above &quot;spirits&quot; and &quot;dead pining,&quot; line 26 of the text. 
Above &quot;bonds of&quot; in the same line, a stag runs or leaps to the
left.  A bird—or perhaps a moth—flies at the end of the
line.  A vine-like form with one loop connects the last letters of lines 25 and 29.</illusobjdesc>

                <illustration location="AB" type="plate">
                    <illusobjdesc>A giant figure, wearing a gown and probably female,
crouches on the ground in an extremely contracted posture.  Her legs are
bent under her body and her upper body is bent forward at a sharp angle
over her legs.  She faces right but her head faces down; her face is covered by her right
arm, bent at the elbow with the upper arm raised.  Apparently, her hands
are together in an attitude of prayer or supplication.  Her long hair
cascades below her right elbow and down the right margin of the text,
perhaps transformed into a waterfall (as is strongly suggested by the
blue coloring in this copy).  Despair and crying are suggested by the
figure; perhaps we are to think of the waterfall as her tears.  The
figure has been variously identified as a personification of Earth
(given the presence of other figures on her body) and even as Urizen, in
spite of the apparent gender.  Seven figures stand or sit on the giant's
body.  On her head is a gowned and seated figure, facing right and
holding (and apparently reading) a book or tablet.  On her back are two
figures, one standing and facing right.  This apparently gowned figure
holds a book or tablet in her or his right hand.  Just to the right is a
kneeling figure, with one leg extended back, and the right arm raised at
135 degrees.  This figure may be looking up and supplicating or praying.
Below these two figures, and standing on the giant figure's right upper
thigh, is a tree with three branches (but no leaves).  Standing and
leaning against this tree is a (probably male) figure facing to the
right.  He wears a broad-brimmed hat and holds and plays a pipe.
Further down the giant's thigh are a few forms that may be sheep lying
(and sleeping?) on her body.  Thus, the piper is probably a shepherd.
Below the piper, a very small figure lies on the giant's calf, facing
right.  This too may be a shepherd, given the presence of a few forms to
the right that may be lying (and sleeping?) sheep.  Just to the left of
the giant's right foot is an embracing couple.  The figure most likely
to be the female in this group is gowned and seated with at least one
leg bent at the knee, head facing down, and left arm raised horizontally
to embrace her companion.  The man (wearing tights?) kneels on the
ground, facing right, with his right arm extended at 45 degrees to touch
the woman's left thigh.  To the right of this couple, and standing on
the ground just beneath the giant's lower leg, a stag runs or leaps to
the right.  The left portion of this design above the text is a forest
of at least four leafless trees.  Their trunks have anthropomorphic
forms, underscored in this copy by the flesh-like coloring.  We can also
see some of their roots near the left margin; one such root extends left of
lines 2-10 in the left margin.  The ground near both margins descends over cliffs.</illusobjdesc>
