On Plate 3 of *The Marriage*, Blake introduces the "contraries...the religious call Good &amp; Evil" (Erdman page 34).  We can identify the figure on the left in the color printed drawing as the "Evil" angel, shackled on his left ankle and rising before flames.  On the right, holding a child apparently struggling to be free, is the "Good" angel.  On Plate 4 of *The Marriage*, the "voice of the Devil" continues to explore the binary oppositions of fallen vision and claims that the religious identify "Evil" with "Energy" and "the Body," and the "Good" with "Reason" and the "Soul" (Erdman page 34).  In his comments that follow, the Devil does not so much reverse this equation as deny the linked differences themselves, stating that the body is an aspect of soul.  The color print may also indicate the fall into the errors of the good/evil, body/soul, energy/reason dualities.  The child may thus represent humanity caught between these contending oppositions.</p></objnote><objsize>43.8 x 58.5 cm.</objsize><windowsize width="600" height="550"/></physdesc><illusdesc><illustration type="plate" location="E"><illusobjdesc>Two male angels representing good and evil occupy opposite sides of the design.  The figure on the left, the evil angel, hovers before large flames.  He leans forward with arms extended horizontally, palms down and fingers slightly spread.  He may be looking, and reaching with his left hand, toward the child held by the other adult figure.  His right leg is extended backwards; a shackle and chain bind his left ankle to the earth below.  The evil angel is nude and muscular, with clearly indicated genitals; he has short, slightly flame-like hair.  His face, particularly his forehead, is wrinkled, possibly with despair or anger rather than age.  On the right, the good angel, a nude, muscular male figure with medium length, flame-like hair, hovers over a shoreline against the backdrop of a rising or setting sun, and holds a child in his arms.  The good angel faces forward with his left leg extended backward, but looks to the left, towards the evil angel, with his mouth open in an expression of fear (or at least serious concern).  His arms are bent at the elbows, and his right hand grasps the child, while the left holds (or at least touches) the side of the child’s torso.  The good angel may be moving the child to the right, out of the reach of the evil angel.  The child (apparently male) in the arms of the good angel faces away from the viewer, but with his head turned to left profile and with arms raised vertically, palms out and fingers spread; his left leg is extended.  He appears to be looking at the evil angel.  He has short, curly hair and a muscular body; his raised left arm covers his mouth.  It is difficult to determine his facial expression, but his posture and gestures suggest fear of the evil angel and an attempt to flee from him.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>angel</characteristic><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>muscular</characteristic><characteristic>genitals</characteristic><characteristic>chained</characteristic><characteristic>shackled</characteristic><characteristic>feet</characteristic><characteristic>left foot</characteristic><characteristic>hovering</characteristic><characteristic>arms extended horizontally</characteristic><characteristic>reaching</characteristic><characteristic>hands raised, palms down</characteristic><characteristic>palms down</characteristic><characteristic>fingers spread</characteristic><characteristic>short hair</characteristic><characteristic>flame-like hair</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>mouth open</characteristic><characteristic>leg extended backward</characteristic><characteristic>legs spread</characteristic><characteristic>leaning</characteristic><characteristic>bending forward</characteristic><characteristic>rising</characteristic><characteristic>body horizontal</characteristic><characteristic>anger</characteristic><characteristic>despair</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The male evil angel hovers on the left before large flames.
