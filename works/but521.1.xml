      <seriesstmt>The William Blake Archive</seriesstmt>
      <updatestmt>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of thirty-three of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible.  All take their subjects from the New Testament and have been added to the twenty Old Testament subjects published in March 2010 as “Illustrations to the Bible, c. 1780-1824,” under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.  This new group is presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).
                
        <lb/>
        <lb/>
        Blake executed most of these New Testament water colors c. 1800-05 for his patron Thomas Butts.  The exceptions are 
        <hi rend="i">The Whore of Babylon</hi>
        of 1809 and 
        <hi rend="i">The Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins</hi>
        in the Yale Center for British Art, datable to c. 1825. The subjects range from the childhood of Jesus to his ascension, the later history of his parents and one of his major followers, St. Paul, and a group of eight designs based on the Book of Revelation.  While the illustrations of the life of Christ are fairly conventional in their subjects, in part because of the long tradition of picturing almost every event in the Gospels, individual motifs recall designs in Blake’s illuminated books and thus offer a window on Blake’s visual interpretation of the Bible. The illustrations of Revelation complement Blake’s intense engagement with apocalyptic events and images in his own poetry.
                    
        <lb/>
        <lb/>
        The selection of fifty-three biblical water colors now available in the Archive will be supplemented in the future with early works, such as 
        <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>
        , datable to c. 1780, and will continue through Blake’s final biblical water colors, such as 
        <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi>
        . 
                    
        <lb/>

        <illustration location="E" type="plate">
          <illusobjdesc>The design takes its subject from Revelation 13:1-2. Dominating the design is the figure of a muscular nude male standing, facing forward with legs spread and bending his legs slightly to crouch. His right leg is on tiptoe and fins are visible along both legs. His arms are at his side, palms down. He has bat-like wings decorated with stars, at least 24 on his right wing and 16 on his left wing. This demon, devil, or dragon has seven heads. The leftmost head is that of a bald male wearing a crown and with a looped horn like a ram's; it faces left and down. The second-to-left head faces left and has a horn like a unicorn's. The third-to-left head is that of a female with long, curly hair that wears a crown or band of gold and has two looped horns; it looks left and down, but faces slightly forward. The middle head has two looped horns like a ram's and is male, facing forward and down with its eyes closed; it wears a spiky crown. The third-to-right head is that of a female with long, curly hair that looks down and to the right but faces slightly forward; it has two looped horns and wears a crown. The second-to-right head faces right and has short hair and a horn like a unicorn's. The rightmost head is that of a bald male wearing a spiky crown; it has one looped horn and looks right and down. This figure also has a tail the extends below the chest of the figure below. The sky backing the scene is dark, perhaps indicating that it takes place at night. At the bottom of the design are dark waves of the sea. Rising from the sea, with only its upper body exposed is a nude figure of another demon, devil, or dragon, facing forward. There are slight indications of hair or fur on its chest. Its arms are raised at 135 degrees and are lined with fins. In its left hand it holds a scepter topped with a fleur-de-lis, surrounded by flames just above the demon's hands. In its right hand it holds a sword, wrapped around with flames. The figure may be male, but its seven heads are animal-like. The leftmost head faces left and up and has its mouth slightly open with its teeth showing; it may have a mustache and has a large and a small horn like a unicorn that may each have a small, spiky crown surrounding its base. The second-to-left head faces forward and up with its mouth open. The third-to-left head faces forward and slightly up and has its mouth open; it has two horns. The middle (highest) head faces forward and looks up with its mouth open and teeth visible; it has two looped horns like a ram's and each horn may have a crown surrounding its base. The third-to-left head faces forward and to the right, looking up with its mouth partly open; it has two looped horns like a ram's. The second-to-right head faces up, forward, and slightly left with its mouth open; its eyes may be closed. The rightmost head faces right and up and has a large and a small horn resembling a unicorn's, perhaps with a small, spiky crown surrounding the base of each.

            <illusobjdesc>Dominating the design is the figure of a muscular nude male standing, facing forward with legs spread and bending his legs slightly to crouch. His right leg is on tiptoe and fins are visible along both legs. His arms are at his side, palms down. He has bat-like wings decorated with stars, at least 24 on his right wing and 16 on his left wing. This demon, dragon, or devil has seven heads. The leftmost head is that of a bald male wearing a crown and with a looped horn like a ram's; it faces left and down and may be smiling. The second-to-left head faces left and has a horn like a unicorn's. The third-to-left head is that of a female with long, curly hair that wears a crown or band of gold and has two looped horns; it looks left and down, but faces slightly forward and may be smiling. The middle head has two looped horns like a ram's and is male, facing forward and down with its eyes closed; it wears a spiky crown. The third-to-right head is that of a female with long, curly hair that looks down and to the right but faces slightly forward; it has two looped horns and wears a crown. The second-to-right head faces right and has short hair and a horn like a unicorn's. The rightmost head is that of a bald male wearing a spiky crown; it has one looped horn and looks right and down. This figure also has a tail the extends below the chest of the figure below.</illusobjdesc>

            <illusobjdesc>Rising from the sea, with only its upper body exposed is a nude figure of a demon, devil, or dragon, facing forward. There are slight indications of hair or fur on his chest. Its arms are raised at 135 degrees and are lined with fins. In its left hand it holds a scepter topped with a fleur-de-lis, surrounded by flames just above the demon's hand. In its right hand it holds a sword, wrapped around with flames. The figure may be male, but its seven heads are animal-like. The leftmost head faces left and up and has its mouth slightly open with its teeth showing; it may have a mustache and has a large and a small horn like a unicorn that may each have a small, spiky crown surrounding its base. The second-to-left head faces forward and up with its mouth open. The third-to-left head faces forward and slightly up and has its mouth open; it has two horns. The middle (highest) head faces forward and looks up with its mouth open and teeth visible; it has two looped horns like a ram's and each horn may have a crown surrounding its base. The third-to-left head faces forward and to the right, looking up with its mouth partly open; it has two looped horns like a ram's. The second-to-right head faces up, forward, and slightly left with its mouth open; its eyes may be closed. The rightmost head faces right and up and has a large and a small horn resembling a unicorn's, perhaps with a small, spiky crown surrounding each base.</illusobjdesc>
