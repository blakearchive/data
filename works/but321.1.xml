"Triumphant Death" hovers above the stricken, his "Dart[s]" descending below each hand.  The curved form extending between his hands seems poised ambiguously between a bow and a scroll.  The figure far right, with a dagger in his left hand, may be a personification of Milton's "despair" who "tended the sick."</p></objnote><objsize>42.7 x 59.0 cm.</objsize><windowsize width="600" height="550"/></physdesc><illusdesc><illustration type="plate" location="E"><illusobjdesc>In the upper center of the design hovers a god-like figure, probably personified Death, in accord with the passage illustrated from Milton's <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi>.  His eyes are closed and he has an unusually long, flowing beard.  He hovers above or within a cloud.  Beneath his raised arms and hands appears a bow-shaped scroll with coiled ends.  Arrow-like darts descend from either the figure or the scroll, two on each side of his beard.  Three figures lie in pain on a heavy woven mat below Death.  We see the head and upper body of a fourth figure proped up behind those lying on the mat.  All four are probably dying.  A figure along the right margin of the design stands, or walks towards the left, with his head hanging low, while holding a dagger in his left hand.  He may be a personification of "despair" in Milton's text.  In the middle distance, right side of the cloud, is a hunched-over figure whose hands clasp either side of his head.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>God</characteristic><characteristic>Death</characteristic><characteristic>old</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>upper body</characteristic><characteristic>eyes closed</characteristic><characteristic>spiky</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>arms raised horizontally</characteristic><characteristic>hands raised, palms down</characteristic><characteristic>fingers</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>shirt</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>hovering</characteristic><characteristic>blind</characteristic><illusobjdesc>An old man with long, spiky hair and an unusually long, flowing beard hovers in the upper center of, or is hovering just above, a cloud.  We see only his arms, hands, head, enormous beard, and possibly something of his gown or long shirt between the lower locks of his beard.  This shirt or gown clearly covers his arms.  His eyes are closed, or possibly sealed to indicate blindness, and his arms are raised horizontally with his palms facing down.  A bow-like scroll extends between his hands; he may be holding it.  The fingers of both hands are carefully delineated.  Four arrow-like darts descend diagonally from either the scroll or the figure, a pair on each side of his beard.  This god-like figure is probably a personification of Death, in accord with the passage illustrated in Milton's <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi>.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="object" location="E"><characteristic>cloud</characteristic><characteristic>arching</characteristic><characteristic>encircling</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A cloud appears below the top center figure, possibly supporting him.

His left eye stares blankly downward.  His skin is dark and slightly greenish.  He holds a dagger in his left hand with his forefinger along the blade.  His left arm is at his side.  The figure’s left ear is prominent.  He probably personifies "despair" in the passage illustrated in Milton's *Paradise Lost*.

While his head and upper body are bent towards the mat, the bottom half of his body (hips and below) faces the viewer; this is particularly true of the right leg, which lies in front of the left leg, crossing the left leg at the ankle.  The left arm is sharply bent upwards as his left hand grips his left shoulder.  The right arm is most likely bent as well, suggested by the right forearm visible underneath his torso (although the rest of the arm is not pictured).  His right fingers are nestled between his left bicep and his left forearm (all four fingers are discernible).  Thus, his arms are wrapped around his upper body.  His face, as well as his twisted posture, express despair and pain.  He has short (?) curly hair.  He is probably diseased and dying.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="CD"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>supine</characteristic><characteristic>arching</characteristic><characteristic>rigid</characteristic><characteristic>pain</characteristic><characteristic>feet</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>mouth open</characteristic><characteristic>despair</characteristic><characteristic>facing up</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>knees</characteristic><characteristic>head bent back</characteristic><characteristic>eyes raised</characteristic><characteristic>ear</characteristic><characteristic>dying</characteristic><characteristic>disease</characteristic><characteristic>lying</characteristic><characteristic>legs together</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The second man from the front on the mat is nude and lies supine.

His hair is between short and long; he may be bearded.  His left knee is drawn up towards his chest; his left leg appears to be crossed over his right leg.  Both feet, but particularly the left, are prominent.
