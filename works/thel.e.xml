   <updatestmt>
    The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of digital editions of <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> copy C from the Morgan Library and Museum, copies E and K from Yale’s Beinecke Library, and copy M from the New York Public Library. They are accompanied by proofs of five of <hi rend="i">Thel</hi>’s eight plates (2-5 and 7) that form copy a in the Morgan Library.  These copies and proofs join copies B, D, F, G, H, I, J, L, N, O, and R. The Archive has now published all extant copies of this illuminated book except copy A in a private collection. 
    <lb/>
    <lb/>
    <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> is dated 1789 by Blake on the title page, but the first plate, which comprises the four questions of “Thel's Motto,” and the last plate, which includes ten questions emanating from Thel’s grave, were written in a different hand and appear to have been completed and first printed in 1790, while Blake was working on <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>. Copies C, E, K, and M are from the first of three printings of <hi rend="i">Thel</hi>, during which Blake produced at least thirteen copies, including copy A. Blake diversified his stock by printing copies in different inks; copy K was printed in green, copies E and M in raw sienna, and copy C in brown. All four copies were lightly finished in water colors and pen and ink. With the proof impressions of copy a, printed in black with enough pressure to pick up ink from the shallows, Blake was able to check the designs as well as the pressure of his printing press.
    <lb/>
    <lb/>
    Copies of <hi rend="i">Thel</hi> from this first press run were certainly on hand when Blake included the book in his advertisement "To the Public" of October 1793: "The Book of Thel, a Poem in Illuminated Printing. Quarto, with 6 designs, price 3s." Blake printed <hi rend="i">Thel</hi> again in c. 1795 (copy F) and 1818 (copies N and O). 
    <lb/>
    <lb/>
    With the publication of <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> copies C, E, K, and M, and proof copy a, the Archive now contains fully searchable and scalable digital editions of 104 copies of Blake's nineteen illuminated books. They are the first publications in the redesigned Archive, which is faster and easier to navigate, is aesthetically more appealing, and offers a more robust search feature. Users may view color corrected digital images of Blake’s works at their true size, and enlarge and rotate these images to examine the text and illustrations in detail. The images are accompanied by diplomatic transcriptions and editors’ notes, as well as illustration descriptions that make it possible to search Blake’s works for visual motifs. The Archive also provides full bibliographic and provenance information for each digital edition it publishes. Though the Archive retains its focus on the material conditions of Blake’s art, presenting images in the context of works and copies, such as <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> copy C, the newly designed site contextualizes each work, copy, and object in a network of relations. Users of the site can view each Blakean object alongside objects in the same copy, objects printed from the same matrix, objects from the same production sequence, and objects with similar designs. This contextualization, which draws on the expertise of the Archive’s editors, enables comparisons across time, medium, and genre, and foregrounds the immense variety and the recurring themes of Blake’s art.
    <lb/>
    <lb/>
    As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with the University of Rochester, the continuing support of the Library of Congress, and the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.

      previous assertion of Stothard's obligations as a designer to Blake, that the copy of *Thel*, formerly Stothard's, bears evidence of familiar use on his part, in
      broken edges, and the marks of a painter's oily fingers" (volume 1, pages 77-78). If Copy E
      once bore finger marks, they are no longer visible as such, although Gilchrist may be
      referring to patches of soiling that do not have the shape of finger prints.</note></numberleaves>

     Hamilton, as indicated by a pencil note on the wrapper, "Bot of Hamilton 1853"; possibly
     acquired in 1853 by Alexander Gilchrist; possibly by inheritance to his wife, Anne Gilchrist,
     in 1861; possibly by inheritance to their son, Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist, in 1885; sold by
     H. H. Gilchrist, Sotheby's, 17 March 1893, lot 1811 (£14.10s. to the dealer Robson &amp; Co.);
     Thomas J. Wise, who sold the book in 1899; Francis Lathrop, who offered the book to the

     collection, Anderson Galleries auction, New York, 2 Dec. 1918, lot 182 ($793 to the dealer A.
     S. W. Rosenbach, possibly acting for Alfred Edward Newton); sold from Newton's collection,
     Parke-Bernet auction, New York, 16 April 1941, lot 128 ($1500 to the dealer C. A. Stonehill,
     possibly acting for Chauncey Brewster Tinker); bequeathed by Tinker to the Beinecke Rare Book
     &amp; Manuscript Library, Yale University, in March 1963.</note>

     <illusobjdesc>A slender tree, entwined with a vine, arches protectively over the title words
      and major pictorial motifs. This combination of motifs and their position suggests a
      tombstone. Two birds and a human figure soar in the sky; seven other human forms, one winged,
      rest or climb among the title letters. Thel, wearing a long gown and holding a shepherd's
      crook, stands lower left and casts a short, dark shadow in front of her (right of where she
      stands). Thel gazes at a nude man embracing a woman around the waist. The latter wears a gown
      and raises her arms. These small figures seem to emerge from the large, bowl-like flowers
      lower center and right. The leaves of this plant and a flower bud complete the design lower
      center and right. The design does not directly illustrate a scene in the text, but the figures
      embracing above the flowers may suggest the "raptures" (object 4, line 13) of the Cloud and
      the "fair eyed dew" (object 4, line 15) during their courtship.</illusobjdesc>

     <illusobjdesc>Five human figures soar around the title-word "Thel" (line 1): a nude man
      reaching toward a large eagle, a nude man holding a sword and shield, and a gowned woman
      holding a small child in her outstretched arms. Below, a nude man rests on the branch of a
      tree (or perhaps a tassel of grain) and looks up toward the child. Spiraling vines and
      stylized flowers, perhaps lilies, spring from several of the title letters. The design does
      not represent any specific incident in the text, but the man with shield and spear may be one
      of the "thousand fighting men" referred to near the end of the poem (object 7, line

      She bows slightly toward the personified Lilly who, with arms folded, bows more deeply toward
      Thel. Both females wear long gowns, ruffled along the hems. A vine climbs lazily about the
      tree trunk. This vine seems to grow from the plant right of Thel. The plant behind and to the
      right of the Lilly is probably a lily, perhaps the St. Bernard's lily. Blue wash with white
      streaks above the Lilly suggests a cloudy sky. The design illustrates the dialogue between
      Thel and the Lilly given in the text on this plate. The moment pictured may be their parting,

      drapery) hovering in the air. The hem of Thel's gown seems to be ruffled by the same breeze on
      which the Cloud floats. The Worm, portrayed as an infant, rests in a bed formed by a lily
      plant. Several flowers on a single stem are pictured just to the left of the infant Worm. A
      tree trunk and a spiraling vine dominate the right margin. Blue washes at the top may indicate
      clouds or sky. Beneath these, washes fading from pink to yellow near the ground may indicate
      sunrise or sunset. The design would seem to illustrate the last two lines of verse on the
