Jesus is pictured as a young child, discovered asleep on a cross by Mary and Joseph. Jesus is nude, though there is a piece of cloth underneath his legs that might have fallen off of him. His legs are crossed at the ankles and his arms are raised horizontally. He is facing up, though his head is turned to face forward. He has short, curly hair and a halo, or at least an aura of light, around his head. Next to the cross and by Jesus's left hand lies a carpenter's square. Joseph, a gowned male with curly hair and a beard, stands to the right of the cross. He faces left and slightly forward, and appears to be looking at the woman to the left. His arms are raised at 45 degrees and he points to the cross with his left hand, forefinger extended, while holding a pair of compasses or dividers in his right hand. Joseph's left foot extends below the hem of his garment. To the right of the cross stands Mary, a gowned female with long, curly hair partly pulled up into a bun. She faces right and slightly forward and seems to be looking down at Jesus on the cross, with her arms bent upward and her hands clenched under her chin as though praying. The toes of both feet are visible beneath the hem of Mary's gown. To the left grow two kinds of flowers, probably lilies and roses. In the middle distance to the left of Mary are two leafy trees, their branches perhaps intertwined. The background is also marked with grass and leafy indeterminate vegetation. A river runs in the middle distance with hills and a mountain in the background. To the left of Joseph's right shoulder is the roof, wall, and perhaps chimney of a building, probably a house. The sky appears to be slightly cloudy, with coloring that suggests sunrise or sunset. The foreground is apparently grassy, with possibly a small plant below the cloth dangling from the cross.

He probably used these, as well as the carpenter's square on the ground below Jesus, to measure the cross during its construction. He may even be measuring either the cross or Jesus, as though fitting his son to it. His left foot extends just beyond the hem of his garment.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="AC"><characteristic>Virgin Mary</characteristic><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>mother</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing down</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>bun</characteristic><characteristic>arms bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>hands together</characteristic><characteristic>praying</characteristic><illusobjdesc>To the left of the cross stands Mary, a gowned female with long, curly hair partly pulled up into a bun.
