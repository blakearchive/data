            The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of 20 of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible. These designs illustrate the Old Testament and are arranged according to the passages illustrated.  They are presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).
            <lb/><lb/>
            The Bible had an enormous influence on Blake’s work as both artist and poet.  Among his many and complex responses to that text are water color drawings.  The present group of 20 is selected from a sequence of about 80 biblical water colors of similar size Blake painted for Thomas Butts between c. 1800 and 1805.  These designs emphasize interactions between the human and the divine.  In works such as <hi rend="i">Ezekiel’s Wheels</hi> and <hi rend="i">David Delivered Out of Many Waters</hi>, the interaction is revelatory or redemptive.  In other designs, including <hi rend="i">Pestilence: The Death of the First-Born</hi>, the relationship between God and humankind devolves into punishment and destruction.
            <lb/><lb/>
            This group of 20 water colors is the first installment in our publication of a large selection of Blake’s water color drawings illustrating the Bible.  In coming months we will publish a group of New Testament illustrations also from the series executed for Butts.  Later we will add early works, such as <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>, datable to c. 1780, and continue through Blake’s final biblical water colors, including <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi> of c. 1824.

Dominating the left side of the design is the giant figure Goliath. He stands, facing forward and to the right. He wears a full suit of armor, including a crested helmet, and his dark skin is almost indistinguishable from the armor. The armor has scales in places on his abdomen. His right leg is bent slightly and his left leg is extended backward and on tiptoe; he may be striding forward. His arms are raised horizontally, though his right arm is also bent upward. His left hand's fingers are spread, and he holds a large spear with his right hand. His mouth is open (he may be speaking) and he appears to be looking to the right at David. To the right of Goliath is a male figure in armor, facing forward and slightly left. He may be Goliath's assistant or squire. He has a beard and his left leg is extended backward. His right arm is at his side. In his right hand he holds a giant sword and in his left he holds a giant shield. On the shield, which is presumably Goliath's, is an intricate design, perhaps of a sea deity or merman. A human male's face with a beard is attached to a fish or eel-like body, which is covered in scales. His right arm is raised vertically and his left is wrapped around his waist. He has a tail and bat-like wings or fins. Backing this figure on the shield are what appear to be flames or waves. To the right of the shield stands the youthful David, facing left and presumably looking at Goliath. His right leg is bent and on tiptoe and his left arm is bent and held across his body. He holds a shepherd's crook to his right. David has short, curly hair and wears a gown. To the right of David, three male figures in armor, crested helmets, and capes are visible. The leftmost figure stands, facing forward and slightly left. He has a beard and his right foot is on tiptoe. He may be looking at David. The middle figure of this group faces forward and slightly right, but turns his head to look left, perhaps at Goliath. His arms are bent, with his right palm vertical and his left hand holding a spear across his shoulder. His right leg is extended backward and on tiptoe. He has a curly beard. The rightmost figure faces forward, though with his head turned to face left. He may be looking at David or Goliath. Behind this group and extending to the left are at least 25 spears, indicating an army. To the left of and between Goliath's legs, a number of spears and at least four tents are visible, indicating the presence of his army. The earth in the foreground is slightly grassy, though David and his army may stand on a road, path, or patch of bare earth with small plants below David's feet. Distant mountains are visible in the background on the left. The sky backing this scene is partly cloudy.
