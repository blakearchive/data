Just right of center lies a nude, slumbering, child Christ. His short, curly hair is backed by a slightly fuzzy halo. He lies on his left side, facing forward, with his right arm dangling. His legs are crossed slightly with his left leg bent backward. His eyes and mouth are closed; his genitals are pictured. To the right of Christ walks a nude boy with short, curly hair. This is John the Baptist as a child. He is smiling and looking at the sleeping child. He casts a shadow to the left of his feet. His right leg is bent backward and on tiptoe. Both arms are at his sides and bent, with the index finger on his left hand pointing diagonally upward. His genitals are pictured. In his right hand he holds a butterfly. His head is bent forward slightly, giving him the look of someone walking quietly. He faces forward and slightly left. To the left of the sleeping Christ sits a gowned woman with long, slightly curly hair.  This is the Virgin Mary. Her legs are bent and crossed, with her right foot visible beneath the hem of her gown. Her right arm is at her side and she holds a book in her right hand, as though she has been interrupted while reading. Her left arm is raised horizontally, with the index finger on her left hand pointing upward in warning to John the Baptist not to wake the sleeping child. Her body is slightly twisted so that the bottom half faces forward and left, while the top half faces forward and right. She appears to be looking at her sleeping son and smiling, with her head bent down slightly. Mary and Christ appear to be resting on a bed or crouch with a sheet and blue drapery below. There may be a pillow below Christ's head. The scene takes place inside a room with a wooden(?) floor. Wooden beams are visible around a doorway on the right side of the design. The wall to the left of the doorway is covered in red drapery. Through the doorway on the right side of the design, a landscape is visible. Some indeterminate vegetation, perhaps including leafy trees with visible trunks, stands beside a grassy riverbank. The river winds past a mountain. A winged animal, perhaps another butterfly, flies outlined against the cloudy sky.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="CD"><characteristic>Christ</characteristic><characteristic>child</characteristic><characteristic>young</characteristic><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>lying</characteristic><characteristic>lying on side</characteristic><characteristic>sleeping</characteristic><characteristic>eyes closed</characteristic><characteristic>short hair</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>halo</characteristic><characteristic>radiance</characteristic><characteristic>arm dangling</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>head toward viewer</characteristic><characteristic>legs crossed</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent at knee</characteristic><characteristic>genitals</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Just right of center lies a nude, slumbering, child Christ.
