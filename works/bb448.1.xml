                <printdate value="1838">1838, c. 1892 <note>1838 (cover label), c. 1892 (the 7 engravings). The Dante engravings were first printed in 38 complete sets in 1838.  A second printing of 50 sets can be dated to c. 1892.  The printing date for impressions on the type of paper represented by the set reproduced here cannot be determined with certainty, but they probably are part of the later printing.  The cover label, printed in letterpress, probably dates from 1838.  Further impressions were pulled from the plates in 1955 (20 sets) and 1968 (25 sets).</note>

                    <illusobjdesc>The scene is set in hell. A bank or ledge covered in vines or roots appears in the right half of the design. A whirlwind of water or fire(?) rises from the lower right to the upper left corner; the column forms a single loop. A second column, more clearly of fire, rises above the bank, extending up and to the left. The sun appears in the upper right corner; beams of light radiate outward. Two nude figures kneel within the disc of the sun in the upper right corner of the design. The female(?) figure to the right is seen from behind. The figures are likely kissing. They probably represent Francesca da Rimini (on the right?) and Paolo Malatesta (on the left?). A gowned male representing Virgil stands on the ledge. Virgil has long hair and his head is turned down; he likely looks toward Dante, below. Virgil's arms are down at his sides and the palms of both hands are turned down. Dante lies supine on the grassy ledge. His body is positioned horizontally with his head to the right. His eyes are closed; he has fainted. Dante's left arm rests on the ground and the palm of his left hand is turned down. Two figures fly or hover within the column above Dante. The figure to the right is a gowned female with long hair. She likely represents Francesca da Rimini. Francesca faces forward with her upper body twisted to the left. Her left arm is bent upward; she reaches for and may touch the male pictured to the left. Francesca's head is turned up and her mouth may be open. Her eyes are raised and she looks at her companion. The figure to the left is a partially nude male with short hair. He likely represents Paolo Malatesta. Paolo is seen from behind with his upper body twisted to the right. Both legs are bent slightly and folds of drapery are visible above his knees. Paolo's right arm is raised at 45 degrees; he reaches for and may touch the female pictured to the right. At least thirty-seven nude figures fly or hover within a large column of water(?) rising from the lower right to the upper left corner of the design. The column forms a single loop and the figures are likely rising upward as if blown by a wind. These figures are often grouped in pairs. Many of the figures are nude or partially nude with twisted bodies and outstretched arms.</illusobjdesc>

To the left and partially below the nude male figure, the fifth figure in the group faces forward with her head at left. She has short hair and may wear a ribbon(?) on top of her head or have tendrils of hair extending upward. Her mouth is open and she appears to look down. Although her torso appears to be nude, she may wear drapery over the lower half of her body as it appears to curl in serpentine folds below her legs, which are extended diagonally downward and to the right. Her right arm is bent upward with palm facing outward and fingers spread; her left arm is at her side.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place in the eighth circle of hell.  Ciampolo, a corrupt former public servant, stands at the left side of the design.  His right arm is bent forward at the elbow and he holds his right hand out with his palm forward and fingers spread.  His left arm, slightly bent, is down and his palm is out.  His fingers are bent and contorted. The hook that the devil to the right brandishes rips a loop of flesh from the bicep of Ciampolo's left arm.  Ciampolo's head rests on his left shoulder.  His mouth is open with teeth showing, and his eyes are swiveled to look in pain and horror at the wound to his arm.  He has short, curly hair and is nude with visible genitals.  At the right side of the design, several nude male demons perch together on a boulder.  The body of the demon in the front faces right, but he twists his neck back and left to look torwards Ciampolo.  His face, with his mouth open in a smile, is seen in three-quarters profile.  He is nude and he has a beard and short, curly hair.  His right leg is bent and drawn in towards the rock, while his bent left leg rests on the ground below.  His right arm is raised at about 45 degrees and extended to the right, in front of him.  He holds a staff, spear, or similar weapon with a hooked top in his right hand.  His left arm appears to be by his side but bent upward; his left hand is by his chest with index finger pointing up and left. His bat-like wings are wrapped around his shoulders and arms.  Behind him, the second demon, Libicocco, straddles the rock facing forward and extends his right leg down to the left.  His right foot rests on the bank on tiptoe.  His left leg is out to the right, bent with left heel propped against the rock.  His head is tilted right but he looks forward with eyes directed to the right; he is smiling. He has long curly hair and bat-like wings spread wide on either side of his body.  He reaches his right arm horizontally out to the left and uses a sharp hook to wound Ciampolo.  His left hand appears to rest on his left knee. The head of a third demon is visible above the second demon's right arm, facing forward and to the left and tilted back to look up.  His eyes are raised.  This demon has short curly hair.  His mouth is open and his wings are visible above his head.  His right hand is visible just below Libicoco's right elbow, and he holds a similar spear or weapon with a hooked top. His straight right leg is also partially visible. The head and shoulders of a fourth demon are visible in the upper right corner.  This demon faces forward and left.  Tusks grow from his mouth, identifying him as Ciriatto.  He has short curly hair and bat-like wings visible to the right of his head.  He may hold a similar spear or weapon with a hook behind his left shoulder. The closest demon perches on a rock covered with indeterminate vegetation at the right side of the design.  A similar rock is partly visible at the left side of the design.  Both rocks sit on a bank or shore of the lake (perhaps of boiling pitch?), which appears between the rocks.  Grass or vegetation appears in the lower right corner of the bank. Lines above the pitch suggest flames or steam rising from the surface of the lake. Dark and stormy clouds or smoke appear in the sky upper left.</illusobjdesc>

Second from front, the second demon, Libicocco, sits or stands straddling the rock facing forward and leaning to the right.  He extends his right leg down to the left.  His right foot rests on the bank on tiptoe.  His left leg is out to the right, bent with left heel propped against the rock.  His head is tilted right but he looks forward, mouth in a smile and eyes looking out to the right.  He has long curly hair and bat-like wings spread wide on either side of his body.  He reaches his right arm horizontally out to the left and uses a sharp hook to cut flesh from Ciampolo's left arm.  His left arm may be at his side as he appears to grasp his left knee with his left hand.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place in the eighth circle of hell.  The lake of boiling pitch stretches across the lower border of the design.  Its liquid roils in whirls or waves.  Flames lick up from its surface, particularly in the troughs of waves.  Two devils attack one another in the air over the lake.  Nude and muscular, they use the sharp claws on their hands to assail each other.  The devil on the left flies or hovers with his body in a horizontal position.  His torso faces down, though he bends backwards or lifts his shoulders and tilts his head back to look to the right.  He twists at the waist so that his hips and legs face away towards the far shore of the lake, and are seen from behind.  His left leg, slightly bent, extends to the left while his right leg is bent at the knee.  The soles of both feet are visible.  His bent arms are spread wide, with the right down and the left up.  With the right palm down and left palm vertical and out, he spreads his fingers like talons.  His jagged, bat-like wings rise up to the left from behind his shoulders.  He has short, curly hair and his mouth is open.  On the right, the opposing devil flies or hovers with his lower body extended to the right, facing forward.  His right leg is bent and his genitals are visible.  He twists at the waist; his torso faces down but he bends backwards or lifts his shoulders to look forward.  His head is turned slightly left.  He raises his right arm vertically and bends it right, over his head.  His left arm is raised horizontally and bent up at the elbow, palm up and out towards the viewer.  Like his opponent, his mouth is open and his teeth are visible.  He has short, curly hair that stands on end.  His bat-like wings extend from his back.  Gentle hills form the far right bank of the lake.  Groups of demons sit on several of these mounds at the right.  Sitting and standing, they seem to have gathered to watch the pair of demons fight over the water.  The majority of the demons raise one or both arms vertically. A larger hill rises on the left, and craggy mountains appear in the distance on the right.  A path rises up from the lower left and circles around the larger hill.  Two figures representing Dante and Virgil stand on the path near the top center of the design.  In this instance, it is impossible to identity either figure specifically.  They seem to face forward and to wear long gowns.  The figure at left appears to look up.  Flames rise from what appears to be a smaller pool of pitch in the bank at the left edge of the design.  Larger and more threatening tongues of fire burn above the mountains on the right, at the horizon.  The strip of sky visible along the upper margin of the design becomes dark at left, perhaps with clouds of smoke.  Swirling lines in the sky above the mountains at right may suggest clouds or smoke.</illusobjdesc>

Like his opponent, his mouth is open and his teeth are visible.  His expression suggests anger mixed with fear.  He has short, curly hair that stands on end.  His bat-like wings extend from his back.</illusobjdesc>

To the right of the standing demons, another demon sits facing forward with bent legs spread and head turned to the left.  This demon is nude and seems to have female breasts and perhaps also long hair.  Her right arm is raised at 135 degrees and bent upward at the elbow with palm forward.  Her left arm is bent up at the elbow and may be propped on her left thigh.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place in a trench of the eighth circle of hell.  The floor of the trench seems to be bare earth or perhaps a lake(?).  A mountain range with two low peaks crosses the design in the distance.  A smaller, lower mound or hill appears in front of the mountain at right.  Fire burns in the sky between the two mountains and may extend to the left margin.  Dark forms above the right mountain suggest clouds or smoke in the sky.  Five human figures and several other creatures occupy a stretch of earth in the foreground.  Cianfa Donati, in the form of a many-limbed serpent, assaults Agnolo Brunelleschi, a nude and rather muscular male thief who stands at the center of the design.  Facing forward, Brunelleschi stands in a slightly crouching posture with his bent right leg forward and his bent left leg back and extended slightly.  His head is bent sharply left by the serpent, which bites his jaw, and his mouth and eyes are wide with horror and pain.  His slightly bent right arm is extended at 45 degrees and drawn back.  His right hand is open, with fingers spread and palm out.  His left arm is at his side, bent up at the elbow with the palm of this hand facing the viewer and the fingers spread.  The giant serpent attacking Brunelleschi bends or hunches forward over the man's back and clutches him with all six clawed feet, its limbs bent around his body.  It lowers its head over the man's left shoulder to seize his jaw in its own open mouth.  Its long, snake-like tail emerges from between Brunelleschi's legs and coils twice around his right leg before trailing onto the ground.  The monster's large, bat-like wings appear above its shoulders.  A small rocky outcropping rises in the lower left corner of the design.  It may be covered with indistinct vegetation, perhaps grass.  Dante and Virgil, who both wear gowns and have long hair, stand together on a ledge in this outcropping.  Dante stands to the left, facing forward and partly hiding Virgil.  His straight arms are down by his side; his hands are open with palms down.  The fingers of his left hand appear to be spread.  He bends his head to the right, so that his face is visible in three-quarters profile.  His mouth is slightly open.  Virgil, slightly to the right of Dante, stands facing forward and to the right.  His head is lowered and he holds his forearms across his torso.  Two male figures stand together at the right side of the design.  Nude, they represent the spirits of Puccio Sciancato and Buoso Donati, Brunelleschi's fellow robbers.  Their individual identities are not distinguished.  The rightmost figure hides his companion slightly and faces away.  He stands in a contrapposto position, bending left at the waist with most of his weight on his right leg; his left leg is bent backwards, with his left foot on tiptoe.  He turns his head left and bends it down, so that his face is seen in profile looking down to the left.  His mouth is open.  His right forearm, bent upward, is visible at the right of his torso.  His right hand as well as his left hand, which appears above his right shoulder, are open with palms facing forward and fingers spread.  The figure on the left faces forward in a slightly contrapposto position, with his weight shifted to his left leg and his right leg bent backwards.  He bends and twists slightly to the left and turns his head left, so that his face is visible in three-quarters profile.  His mouth is open and his genitals are visible.  Both of his forearms are raised horizontally, with his hands open, fingers spread, and palms out.  Snakes abound on the ground below the figures and in the floor of the trench.  One appears to the right of Brunelleschi's feet, its body forming two incomplete loops and its head raised to look forward.  The heads of two snakes are visible to the right of the rocky outcropping in the lower left corner of the design.  Side-by-side, both look up; they may be watching the six-footed serpent attack Brunelleschi.  Between Brunelleschi and Virgil, a snake may appear in the distance on the floor of the trench.  Its body coils into three raised loops but appears more abstracted than the other snakes.  To the right of Brunelleschi's left hip, another serpent is visible in the distance undulating along the floor of the trench or with its tail extended over the body of water or bare earth.  Its head seems to be raised; it looks up.  Just below the mountain on the right, a snake's body curves up from the floor of the trench or on the far side of the lake or bare earth.  The head of another serpent is raised just to the left of the right edge of the design, perhaps as if rising out of the lake.  It looks forward and to the left with its mouth open.  The head and part of the body of a snake appears in the lower right corner of the design.  The reptile's head is raised and looks left with its mouth open, displaying fangs and an extended tongue.  Small clusters of spiky tufts, perhaps of grass or fire, appear throughout the design; these are particularly noticeable just above the lower margin.</illusobjdesc>

He stands in a contrapposto position, bending left at the waist with most of his weight on his right leg; his left leg is bent and extended backwards, with his left foot on tiptoe.  He turns his head left and bends it down, so that his face is seen in profile looking down to the left.  His mouth is open and his short hair stands on end, suggesting fear or terror.  His right forearm, bent upward, is visible at the right of his torso.  Both palms are open (the right facing away from the viewer and the left facing forward) and fingers spread.</illusobjdesc>

They represent the spirits of Puccio Sciancato and Buoso Donati, Brunelleschi's fellow robbers.  Their individual identities are not distinguished.  The figure on the left faces forward in a slightly contrapposto position, with his weight shifted to his left leg and his right leg bent.  He bends slightly to the left and turns his head left, so that his face is visible in three-quarters profile.  Both of his forearms are raised horizontally, with his hands open, fingers spread, and palms out.  His long curly hair falls over his shoulders.  His mouth is open in what may be an expression of fear or terror and his genitals are pictured.</illusobjdesc>

                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place in a trench in the eighth circle of hell.  The floor of the trench seems to be flat earth.  Tongues of fire leap from the floor of the trench nearly to the top of the design, forming a backdrop extending horizontally across the design.  Clouds, possibly of smoke, also cross the top of the design.  More flames burst downward from the clouds in the upper left corner, center, and far right margin.  Four figures and a snake occupy a strip of earth in the foreground separate from the trench.  Small flames burning in a line span the plate horizontally and appear to separate the earth in the foreground from the background floor of the trench.  The flames extend as far right as Donati's right leg.  This figure, Buoso Donati, stands at the right side of the design; he has just been bitten by a snake.  He is nude and his navel displays the wound from the serpent's bite.  He bends to the left at the waist and lowers his head to look down at the serpent below and to the left.  His mouth is open in a yawn, as Dante's text describes, displaying his teeth and tongue.  Alternatively, he may be crying out in pain.  His expression suggests surprised confusion as well as pain and terror.  The short hair around his head stands on end; longer locks fall past his shoulders.  Both of his arms are down, but bent upward at the elbow.  His right arm crosses his torso with his open right hand raised, vertical palm facing away and fingers spread.  His left arm is raised to the right with the palm of this hand facing out and up to the right and the fingers spread.  His right leg is bent and his heel may be lifted off the ground.  The snake that has just bitten Buoso Donati appears below him to the left.  It seems to be suspended in the air in the process of falling back to earth.  Both the wound and the serpent emit smoke, together forming a cloud that links the snake's mouth with the injury it created.  The scaly serpent has thin arms with long talen-like fingers; two sets of protrusions on its lower body resemble fins(?).  Dante and Virgil, who are both gowned, stand together at the left edge of the design, on a slightly raised stone mound in the lower left corner.  Dante stands slightly to the left of Virgil, facing forward.  He bends to the right and turns his head rightward so that his face is seen in three-quarters profile.  His head is also bent down slightly.  His arms are down by his side and bent at the elbows, so that his forearms are horizontal.  His hands are raised, with vertical palms facing out towards the viewer.  Virgil, to the right of and slightly hidden by Dante, faces forward and to the right.  He bends his head and turns it right, so that his face is visible in profile.  His left arm is bent at the elbow.  The nude figure of Puccio Sciancato, one of Brunelleschi's fellow robbers, stands just to the right of Dante and Virgil.  Sciancato stands in an awkward twisted posture: his left leg is positioned to face right but his right leg and hips face forward while his shoulders face slightly left.  He turns his slightly bent head back to the right, so that his face is seen in three-quarters profile looking right.  He also leans backward slightly, away from Buoso Donati.  His right arm is extended down by his side and drawn back, with the palm of his open right hand facing down.  His left arm is bent up at the elbow and drawn across his torso.  His left hand makes a fist and may rest on his breastbone.  His right leg is forward, while his left leg is drawn back.  His facial expression and his body language together suggest fear.  A snake is crawling across the ground behind Sciancato.  It faces left and moves with its mouth open.</illusobjdesc>

The end of its tail may rest along Donati's right thigh; the rest of its body curls around to form an incomplete loop so that its head faces back up to the right towards Donati's face.  Small spiky scales cover its body and a spiky crest appears on its head.  Its mouth is open slightly and smoke emerges.  The creature has thin arms with long talon-like fingers extended below its head.  Two sets of protrusions on its lower body resemble fins(?).</illusobjdesc>

He turns his slightly bent head back to the right, so that his face is seen in three-quarters profile looking right.  His eyes are raised.  He also leans backward slightly, away from Buoso Donati.  His right arm is extended down by his side and drawn back, with the palm of his open right hand facing down.  His left arm is bent up at the elbow and drawn across his torso.  His left hand makes a fist and may rest on his breastbone.  His right leg is forward, while his left leg is drawn back; his genitals are visible.  His facial expression and his body language together suggest fear.  He has short curly hair, some of which stands on end.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place in the tenth trench of the eighth circle of hell.  The floor of the trench stretches the length of the bottom of the design, and seems to be bare earth, furrowed in places or perhaps water in the center and/or far right.  A rock bridge arches down from the upper right corner of the design to the floor of the trench.  A second rock bridge arches from the upper left corner of the design down to the floor of the trench below, near the lower left corner.  Nude human forms are visible in this bridge, petrified in contorted positions.  Most of these forms are difficult to resolve into individuals.  Two additional rock bridges in the distance are visible between the bridges that appear at either side of the design.  Part of another distant rock bridge appears in the lower right corner of the design, to the right of the bridge on which Dante and Virgil stand.  A dark cloud fills the top left corner of the design and extends most of the way across the top edge of the design.  Tongues of flame lick down from beneath the cloud in the upper left corner.  Undulating lines in the sky in the center, both above and below the middle rock bridges, and in the lower right corner, below the distant bridge, suggest smoke or cloud.  Dante and Virgil stand side-by-side on a small shelf in the stone bridge at the right.  Dante stands to the left of Virgil and obscures his companion slightly.  Both wear long gowns, and bend their arms up at the elbow in front of their torsos, with hands together in front of their faces.  Each may hold his nose.  Four "falsifiers," or forgers, who are now afflicted with disease lie in a huddle in the lower left corner of the design, near the base of the human bridge.  The leftmost of these lies supine with his(?) head at right and body partially resting against the sinner behind him, so that his torso faces forward as well as up.  With the exception of his face, his head and body are completely draped.  His eyes are closed.  The figure on which the leftmost figure leans sits upright facing forward with head and eyes raised up, perhaps with tears in the corners of each eye.  The figure has long hair and may be female.  Her mouth may be open.  The majority of her body is obscured by the third figure in the group who lies supine in front of her and on whom the second figure rests her folded arms and hands.  The third figure turns his(?) head to face forward, and his mouth is open widely.  His right arm is extended, raised at 135 degrees, palm facing down.  He may be nude or wear drapery around his lower body.  His legs may be bent upward, but they are partially blocked by the fourth and final figure in this group at right.  This heavy sinner to the right lies or crawls with his belly resting on his right leg, which is bent and drawn up beneath him and lies on the ground.  This sinner's bent left leg is extended to the right and his left foot rests on tiptoe.  He bends backwards and lifts his torso, bending his head back to look left.  His mouth is open.  His left arm is down and his elbow, forearm, and many of the spread fingers of his left hand all rest on the ground.  Another group of diseased falsifiers lie together on the trench floor near the bridge on which Dante and Virgil stand.  Two males at the top of the pile sit with their backs together.  They are Griffolino of Arezzo and Capocchio of Siena, both of whom were alchemists.  The rightmost of these faces right and away, and bends to the right to look forward.  His right arm is down and bent up at the elbow across his lower back; he raises his right hand and uses his spread fingers to scratch his back.  His left arm is raised and bent down past his head, and he scratches his back between his shoulder blades with the fingers on this hand.  The other seated male faces left.  His left arm is by his side, bent up at the elbow across his back, which he scratches with the spread fingers of his left hand.  He bends forward sharply over his own lap.  Both figures appear to have nets over their bent legs  The forms of the other sinners lumped into the pile are difficult to distinguish, though at least seven faces and several more heads and upper bodies emerge.  They are forgers.  Additional faces and figures appear throughout the landscape, including a bearded male figure with arm bent upward depicted within the base of the rightmost rock bridge, a vaguer face just above him, and four heads visible emerging from the trench floor or lake below the arch of the central rock bridges.</illusobjdesc>

Some bodies are fully visible, others only partially.  The lower body and right arm of the third figure from the base of the arch is visible, facing right.  The figure's right arm is bent and resting on its lap, hand on knee.  Its legs are bent, suggesting the figure is (or was) sitting. The head of the figure becomes indistinguishable at left.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>This scene takes place in the ninth circle of hell, on a frozen lake that stretches across the bottom of the design.  The base of a rock bridge is visible at the right side of the design, rising from the surface of the frozen lake to the upper right corner of the design.  Four petrified or frozen nude human forms appear in the bridge: a figure in the top right sits with eyes closed and knees bent upward, hands holding its head; the leftmost figure kneels or crouches facing forward and left with hands clasped together and tears streaming down his face; in the bottom middle of the bridge two upside-down nude figures lie with legs extended or bent upward and heads bent back into the lake below.  Dark lines to the left of the rock bridge at the right edge of the design suggests a dark sky, perhaps with clouds, which grows lighter as it approaches the left edge of the design.  A rock or low mound is visible at the left edge of the design, near the lower left corner.  This may be stone or frozen ice.  Shadow covers the surface of the lake in the distance to the right of this mound.  In front of the mound at right, a human head appears on the surface of the ice.  The head has long hair and closed eyes.  It faces forward and leans to the left.  Between this head and the mound, there is another round form that is less defined but may suggest a second head or mound.  The two gowned figures of Dante and Virgil stand on the ice at the left side of the design.  Dante stands at left, facing forward and slightly to the right.  He tilts his head to the right and bends it down.  His left arm is down by his side, and he holds his left hand very slightly forward, with his vertical palm facing out.  His right arm is down and bent forward at the elbow; his open right hand is raised at a right angle with the vertical palm facing out.  Virgil stands to the right of Dante, who hides him slightly.  Virgil faces forward and slightly to the right.  He bends his head and tilts it to the right.  His left arm is bent up at the torso, and his left hand rests palm down on his chest.  The head and shoulders of Bocca degli Abbati, a traitor to his hometown of Florence, rise above the surface of the frozen lake in the lower left corner of the design.  He faces forward, but turns his head up and slightly to the left, tilting it back as well.  His mouth is open, displaying his teeth, and his eyes are wide.  His open hands are raised above the ice, palms facing forward.  Eight faces and partial bodies of frozen traitors punished in this circle of hell emerge from the surface of the lake.  The leftmost frozen figure to the right of Virgil’s lower leg faces forward in a horizontal position with the right half of his head and upper body visible above the ice.  He appears to have long hair and wear a crown.  To his right, a female head with long hair faces forward.  Her head is bent to the right.  Directly below this pair, a third head is visible facing up and left; this figure is a bearded male with long hair who wears a laurel crown.  An indistinguishable form above this head at right may suggest another frozen head.  Below the third head at right, a fourth head barely rises above the lake but it faces up and left and wears a crown.  In the right corner of the design, three frozen figures are more fully visible, all facing up with heads at right.  The lowest of these is a male figure with a mustache and beard who wears a gown and holds a sword in his left hand, which is by his side.  Above him, the middle female figure wears a gown and also may hold an object in her left hand, which is by her side.  Her head is bent sharply back and her eyes are open wide.  The third and highest figure in this group is an old bearded male figure with eyes closed.  Above this figure at left, the top half of a forward-facing head rises from the lake.  Small shadows appear on the surface of the lake in the lower right corner of the design.</illusobjdesc>
