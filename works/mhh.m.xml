            The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of the electronic editions of <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> Copies K, L, and M. The Archive is also publishing the collection list for the Victoria University Library in Toronto and Alexander Gourlay's revised Glossary of Terms, Names, and Concepts in Blake.<lb/><lb/> 
            Blake etched twenty-seven plates for <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> in relief in 1790. Copy K is an early printing of Plates 21-24, and Copies L and M are early printings of Plates 25-27, "A Song of Liberty." Copy K is in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Copy L is in the Essick Collection, and Copy M, formerly in the Bentley Collection, is in the Victoria University Library. Only nine complete copies of the <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> are known to exist; Copies K, L, and M, apparently printed as autonomous pamphlets, join six complete copies previously published in the Archive (and now republished with corrected transcriptions).<lb/><lb/>
            The four plates of Copy K were printed in black ink on both sides of a single sheet of wove paper, folded down the middle after printing to form two leaves. Plate 21 is in its first state and the vignette on Plate 24 is missing, probably masked during printing but possibly not yet executed. In Copies L and M, Plate 25 is in its first state, and thus these copies were also printed very early in the production process; in Copy M, the eight lines of the "Chorus" on Plate 27 were masked during printing. The plates were printed on single sheets folded down the middle to form pamphlets of two leaves. Copy L was printed in brownish-black on laid paper and Copy M was printed in grayish-black on wove paper.<lb/><lb/>
            Like all the illuminated books in the Archive, the text and images of <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> Copies K, L, and M are fully searchable and are supported by our Inote and ImageSizer applications. With the Archive's Compare feature, users can easily juxtapose multiple impressions of any plate across the different copies of this or any of the other illuminated books. New protocols for transcription, which produce improved accuracy and fuller documentation in editors' notes, have been applied to all copies of <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> in the Archive.<lb/><lb/>
            With the publication of <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> Copies K, L, and M, the Archive now contains fully searchable and scalable electronic editions of sixty-five copies of Blake's nineteen illuminated books in the context of full bibliographic information about each work, careful diplomatic transcriptions of all texts, detailed descriptions of all images, and extensive bibliographies. In addition to illuminated books, the Archive contains many important manuscripts and series of engravings, sketches, and water color drawings, including Blake's illustrations to Thomas Gray's <hi rend="i">Poems</hi>, water color and engraved illustrations to Dante's <hi rend="i">Divine Comedy</hi>, the large color printed drawings of 1795 and c. 1805, the Linnell and Butts sets of the <hi rend="i">Book of Job</hi> water colors and the sketchbook containing drawings for the engraved illustrations to the <hi rend="i">Book of Job</hi>, the water color illustrations to Robert Blair's <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, and the water color illustrations to John Milton's <hi rend="i">Paradise Regained</hi>, <hi rend="i">L'Allegro</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Il Penseroso</hi>, as well as the Butts and Thomas sets of illustrations to Milton's <hi rend="i">Comus</hi>, <hi rend="i">Nativity</hi> ode, and <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi>.<lb/><lb/>
            As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the continuing support of the Library of Congress, and the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.

of "howling" in line 15.  More flame-like vegetation appears behind the figure,
as well as near the right margin of line 18.  A flower- or leaf-bearing vine

corner of the plate, the ubiquitous grapevine and leaf combination continues,
attached to the "y" of "jealousy."  The "g's" of "among" and "flaming" in line
24 also sport flourishes, the former vegetative, the latter a flame-like(?)
tassel, possibly representing the "flaming hair" named in the text.  Various
other small-scale vegetative designs adorn the plate, e.g., the leaf-bearing stem
preceding verse 7 in line 14, and the leafy attachment to the "A" in the opening

Just beyond it,
a leafless tree arches to the ground.  An upside-down figure personifies the
"falling" fire of line 3.  Next to it are some hatched lines wherein are
discernible two horses running left in other copies, but here the cluster of
lines (if representational at all) suggests clouds.  Two figures, many of the
details of their gestures and positions indistinct, follow "forehead" in line 8. 
They sit facing each other, the second gowned or otherwise draped.  To the right
of these figures, another tree(?) arches right, its leafless branch seemingly
pointing toward a serpentine vine that connects with the "h" of "shot" at the end
of line 9.  Further down, a snake (or simply a line?) extends from "away" in line
12 to the right margin.  A relatively large-scale interlinear branch and leaf
combination ornaments the space beside "rocks" in line 18.  Hovering above "then"
in line 21, a somewhat shadowy figure faces right, its body horizontal.  It
extends one arm forward, touching the hand of a sitting figure.  A group of five
figures, possibly signifying the "gloomy king" and his retinue of lines 15-17,
appears after "king" in line 23: the first figure stands facing right; the second
sits cross-legged(?) on the ground.  They are followed by two figures who stand
with arms extended, hailing the final figure, perhaps the king.  He walks toward
them with arms outstretched.  Above "his" at the end of line 24 is a large leaf. 
Various other vegetative motifs adorn the plate, e.g., the looped vines growing
from the ascenders of "London" and "thunder" in lines 4 and 24; the leaf
extending from the "h" of "then" in line 21; and the banner waving from the "b"

extends one arm forward.  Its companion seems to hold an object; its arms may
also be outstretched.

if one takes him for the "starry" and "gloomy" king of this "Song of Liberty." 
He kneels on one leg and points(?) toward another figure with his left arm,
raised horizontally.  Running amidst wispy clouds, this second figure may
represent the "son of fire in his eastern / cloud," who is named in lines 4 and
5 and in whose direction the king of the text casts his eyes.  Three lines down,
two horses, one of which is mounted, gallop leftward in the direction of another
                  horse(?)—this one recumbent—and an indistinct form, both of which rest on some
grassy tableland.  The horse motif reappears below the text, where two horses. 
The horse on the left gallops or leaps toward the text.  Its companion rears up
on hind legs, arching its head and back.  A small bird soars to the left of the
horse on the right.  Vines follow the last line of text.  Various other
vegetative motifs adorn the plate, e.g., the looped vine growing from the "t" of
