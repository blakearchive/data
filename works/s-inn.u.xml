                The William Blake Archive http://www.blakearchive.org is pleased to announce the publication of new electronic editions of Copies B and U of Blake's
                <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi>
                .
                <lb/><lb/>
                Copies B and U are a study in contrasts, yet both are from the earliest printings of this book. Copy B, now in the Rosenwald Collection, Library of Congress, was printed with fifteen other copies of
                <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi>
                in 1789, four of which were later joined with
                <hi rend="i">Experience</hi>
                impressions, printed in 1794, to form
                <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi>
                Copies B, C—which is in the Archive—D, and E. Unlike many of these early copies of
                <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi>
                , Copy B still consists of all 31 plates originally composed and executed for
                <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi>
                . Like them, however, it was printed in a raw sienna ink on 17 leaves and exemplifies Blake's early printing and coloring style. The plates were wiped of their plate borders, the illustrations very lightly washed in watercolors, and the texts left unwashed. This mode of presentation, along with printing both sides of the leaves to create facing pages, emphasized the prints as book pages rather than prints or paintings. Good examples of printing and coloring illuminated plates to look like minatures can be seen in
                <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>
                Copy Z, also in the Archive.
                <lb/><lb/><hi rend="i">Innocence</hi>
                Copy U, from the Houghton Library, Harvard University, is an excellent example of printing illuminated plates to look like prints. Like etchings and engravings, they were printed on one side of the leaf in black ink and left uncolored. Copy U, which was printed with untraced Copy V, had been dated c. 1814, because of some stylistic similarities it shares with illuminated works assumed to have been produced around that time. But, in fact, Copy U is the
                <hi rend="i">first</hi>
                copy of
                <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi>
                printed. The presence of a unique first state for "Infant Joy" proves this sequence; the bottom part of the "J" in the title is missing in all extant impressions, but here it extends into the flower. Copy U was printed before Copy B and all other early copies; the ink color, printing style (recto only), and lack of hand coloring suggest a date of printing before Blake had developed his special ways of producing his illuminated books and instead repeated styles and techniques long familiar to him as a commercial engraver.
                <lb/><lb/>
                Both electronic editions have newly edited SGML-encoded texts and new images scanned and color-corrected from first-generation 4x5" transparencies; they are each fully searchable for both text and images and supported by the Inote and ImageSizer applications described in our previous updates.
                <lb/><lb/>
                With the publication of these two titles, the Archive now contains 35 copies of 18 separate books, including at least one copy of every one of Blake's works in illuminated printing except the 100 plates of
                <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>
                (forthcoming).

This is also the arrangement of the plates reproduced from Copy U in *Songs of Innocence[.] William Blake[.] Reproduced by Photography from a Perfect Black and White copy of the Original Issue of 1789* (Boston: Little, Brown &amp; Co., 1883), and the sequence recorded in Geoffrey Keynes and Edwin Wolf 2nd, *William Blake's Illuminated Books: A Census* (New York: Grolier Club, 1953) 17.

The capital letters of the title all have such extensions. The "y" of "Boy" (line 1) extends far to the left and down the left margin, and the vertical stroke of the "d" of "Found" is extravagantly extended to fill the space above the angel. Another cluster of vine-like decorations begins in the right margin in front of the legs of the angel and extends downward (with loops and leaves) into the space below the poem.</illusobjdesc></component></illustration></illusdesc><phystext><vspace extent="6"/><texthead justify="left"><l n="s-inn.u.illbk.15.01" justify="left" indent="5">The Little Boy Found</l></texthead><vspace extent="1"/><lg type="verse" justify="left"><l n="s-inn.u.illbk.15.02" justify="left">The little boy lost in the lonely fen,</l><l n="s-inn.u.illbk.15.03" justify="left">Led by the wand'ring light,</l><l n="s-inn.u.illbk.15.04" justify="left">Began to cry, but God ever nigh,</l><l n="s-inn.u.illbk.15.05" justify="left">Appeard like his father in white.</l></lg><vspace extent="1"/><lg type="verse" justify="left"><l n="s-inn.u.illbk.15.06" justify="left">He kissed the child &amp; by the hand led</l><l n="s-inn.u.illbk.15.07" justify="left">And to his mother brought,</l><l n="s-inn.u.illbk.15.08" justify="left">Who in sorrow pale. thro' the lonely dale</l><l n="s-inn.u.illbk.15.09" justify="left">Her little boy weeping sought.</l></lg></phystext></desc><desc id="s-inn.u.illbk.16" dbi="s-inn.U.P16-20"><objtitle><title type="transcribed">Night</title>

Tendrils extending from both margins help separate the stanzas from one another. The vine right of the final stanza on the plate has several loops suggesting a spiral. The vine full of leaves and flowers(?) that extends across the top of the plate above the title and fills the top right corner and the space right of the first stanza is distinct from the flame-like vegetation that dominates the rest of the plate. Extensions of letters in the title (line 1) contribute to both forms of vegetation: the initial "A" and "C" to the vine above, the "S" to both. In the text of the poem, occasional letters have modest decorative extensions, and there are a few bits of stray decorative vegetation.</illusobjdesc></component></illustration></illusdesc><phystext><vspace extent="1"/><texthead justify="left"><l n="s-inn.u.illbk.20.01" justify="left" indent="5">A CRADLE SONG</l></texthead><vspace extent="1"/><lg type="verse" justify="left"><l n="s-inn.u.illbk.20.02" justify="left">Sweet dreams form a shade,</l><l n="s-inn.u.illbk.20.03" justify="left">O'er my lovely infants head,</l><l n="s-inn.u.illbk.20.04" justify="left">Sweet dreams of pleasant streams,</l><l n="s-inn.u.illbk.20.05" justify="left">By happy silent moony beams</l></lg><vspace extent="1"/><lg type="verse" justify="left"><l n="s-inn.u.illbk.20.06" justify="left">Sweet sleep with soft down.</l><l n="s-inn.u.illbk.20.07" justify="left">Weave thy brows an infant crown.</l><l n="s-inn.u.illbk.20.08" justify="left">Sweet sleep Angel mild,</l><l n="s-inn.u.illbk.20.09" justify="left">Hover o'er my happy child.</l></lg><vspace extent="1"/><lg type="verse" justify="left"><l n="s-inn.u.illbk.20.10" justify="left">Sweet smiles in the night,</l><l n="s-inn.u.illbk.20.11" justify="left">Hover over my delight.</l><l n="s-inn.u.illbk.20.12" justify="left">Sweet smiles Mothers smiles</l><l n="s-inn.u.illbk.20.13" justify="left">All the livelong night beguiles.</l></lg><vspace extent="1"/><lg type="verse" justify="left"><l n="s-inn.u.illbk.20.14" justify="left">Sweet moans, dovelike sighs,</l><l n="s-inn.u.illbk.20.15" justify="left">Chase not slumber from thy eyes,</l><l n="s-inn.u.illbk.20.16" justify="left">Sweet moans, sweeter smiles.</l><l n="s-inn.u.illbk.20.17" justify="left">All the dovelike moans beguiles.</l></lg><vspace extent="1"/><lg type="verse" justify="left"><l n="s-inn.u.illbk.20.18" justify="left">Sleep sleep happy child.</l><l n="s-inn.u.illbk.20.19" justify="left">All creation slept and smil'd,</l><l n="s-inn.u.illbk.20.20" justify="left">Sleep sleep. happy sleep.</l><l n="s-inn.u.illbk.20.21" justify="left">While o'er thee thy mother weep</l></lg><vspace extent="1"/><lg type="verse" justify="left"><l n="s-inn.u.illbk.20.22" justify="left">Sweet babe in thy face.</l><l n="s-inn.u.illbk.20.23" justify="left">Holy image I can trace.</l><l n="s-inn.u.illbk.20.24" justify="left">Sweet babe once like thee.</l><l n="s-inn.u.illbk.20.25" justify="left">Thy maker lay and wept for me</l></lg><textfoot justify="left"><l n="s-inn.u.illbk.20.26" justify="left" indent="35"><catchword>Wept</catchword></l></textfoot></phystext></desc><desc id="s-inn.u.illbk.21" dbi="s-inn.U.P21-17"><objtitle>,
