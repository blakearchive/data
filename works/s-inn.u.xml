            <updatestmt> The William Blake Archive http://www.blakearchive.org is pleased to
                announce the publication of new electronic editions of Copies B and U of Blake's <hi
                    rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> . <lb/><lb/> Copies B and U are a study in
                contrasts, yet both are from the earliest printings of this book. Copy B, now in the
                Rosenwald Collection, Library of Congress, was printed with fifteen other copies of
                    <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> in 1789, four of which were later joined with <hi
                    rend="i">Experience</hi> impressions, printed in 1794, to form <hi rend="i"
                    >Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> Copies B, C—which is in the
                Archive—D, and E. Unlike many of these early copies of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> ,
                Copy B still consists of all 31 plates originally composed and executed for <hi
                    rend="i">Innocence</hi> . Like them, however, it was printed in a raw sienna ink
                on 17 leaves and exemplifies Blake's early printing and coloring style. The plates
                were wiped of their plate borders, the illustrations very lightly washed in
                watercolors, and the texts left unwashed. This mode of presentation, along with
                printing both sides of the leaves to create facing pages, emphasized the prints as
                book pages rather than prints or paintings. Good examples of printing and coloring
                illuminated plates to look like minatures can be seen in <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>
                Copy Z, also in the Archive. <lb/><lb/><hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> Copy U, from the
                Houghton Library, Harvard University, is an excellent example of printing
                illuminated plates to look like prints. Like etchings and engravings, they were
                printed on one side of the leaf in black ink and left uncolored. Copy U, which was
                printed with untraced Copy V, had been dated c. 1814, because of some stylistic
                similarities it shares with illuminated works assumed to have been produced around
                that time. But, in fact, Copy U is the <hi rend="i">first</hi> copy of <hi rend="i"
                    >Innocence</hi> printed. The presence of a unique first state for "Infant Joy"
                proves this sequence; the bottom part of the "J" in the title is missing in all
                extant impressions, but here it extends into the flower. Copy U was printed before
                Copy B and all other early copies; the ink color, printing style (recto only), and
                lack of hand coloring suggest a date of printing before Blake had developed his
                special ways of producing his illuminated books and instead repeated styles and
                techniques long familiar to him as a commercial engraver. <lb/><lb/> Both electronic
                editions have newly edited SGML-encoded texts and new images scanned and
                color-corrected from first-generation 4x5" transparencies; they are each fully
                searchable for both text and images and supported by the Inote and ImageSizer
                applications described in our previous updates. <lb/><lb/> With the publication of
                these two titles, the Archive now contains 35 copies of 18 separate books, including
                at least one copy of every one of Blake's works in illuminated printing except the
                100 plates of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> (forthcoming). <lb/><lb/></updatestmt>

                        top right on each leaf. These numbers are not by Blake and are not shown
                        here. They probably record the binding order established c. 1818 (see
                        Binding, below), although this is not necessarily the original sequence
                        established by Blake or his wife Catherine. This is also the arrangement of

                        footnote 5 on page 377, Bentley states that this order "derives from the

                        the group is a large apple(?) tree bearing fruit; around the trunk loosely
                        spirals a vine. Various small figures can be seen among the letters of the
                        title, including a piper wearing a broad-brimmed hat standing in the crook

                    <illusobjdesc>Below the text, a procession of nine adults and children
                        (including one infant) in a variety of positions moves generally leftward.
                        Overhead in the branches of two intertwining grape vines that are rooted at
                        lower right and grow upward along the right margin and left to embrace the
                        stanzas of the poem, one boy, left, stretches on tiptoe to reach a cluster
                        of grapes on the left while a second boy, right, hands another cluster to a
                        girl who reaches up from the grass below. Next to her, walking left, is a
                        long-haired male in hat and tights; he holds a bunch of grapes in his
                        extended left hand. Next in line is a woman who looks down at the infant in
                        her arms. A small child stands next to the left. In the center, the tallest
                        figure in the group, perhaps "Old John with white hair" (line 11, Object 5),
                        points forward with his right hand. A boy to the left, who faces away from
                        the viewer, holds a bat at his side with his left hand. At the front of the
                        procession are a boy and girl, both looking back toward the rest of the
                        group. Between them is a kite that the girl may be holding. The many ink
                        droplets in this copy, clustered around the vines right and left of the
                        text, are probably accidents of inking and thus

                        boys stand in front of him. One, probably the "little English boy" (line 6)
                        whom the little black boy addresses in the final two stanzas of the poem,
                        stands at Jesus's knee, holds his hands in a praying gesture, and looks up
                        at Jesus, who looks down at him. The other boy, probably the little black
                        boy from the previous object though not dark-skinned as he was there
                        (presumably in conformation with the sense of "When I from black and he from

                        right hand out toward him to "stroke his silver hair" (line 11). All three
                        are sheltered under a leafy, willow-like tree that forms a tight arch over
                        their heads. A flock of sheep grazes to the left of the left-most boy. There
                        may be a river running at the foot of the plate. A vine rooted in the bank
                        to the right of the tree grows up the right margin. Another, much shorter
                        vine grows near the left margin.</illusobjdesc>

                        against the trunk and reads a book in her lap. To the right is a second,
                        slimmer tree with a vine around its trunk. There are two "hills" (line 13)
                        in the background with a notch between them.</illusobjdesc>

                            dance, in an incomplete circle. Clockwise from the left: the two
                            children furthest left (a girl[?] and a boy) stretch something, perhaps
                            a piece of cloth used in a game, between them; a girl raises her arms
                            horizontally and faces right with legs outspread; a boy raises his arms
                            higher, as does the long-haired girl to the right of him, whose leg is
                            extended behind her; holding her hand, a boy runs left and reaches
                            forward to hold the hand of another running or striding boy, left leg
                            extended behind him, who raises his free left hand as he moves left and
                            back, perhaps toward the opening between the pair furthest left. All the
                            girls wear gowns; all the boys apparently wear tight-fitting garments.
                            These are the "little ones" who "leaped &amp; shouted &amp; laugh'd"
                            (line 16) and remonstrate with the nurse in the poem.</illusobjdesc>

                        the title, in the margins, and between the three stanzas. The title area is
                        full of vegetative swirls, curls, and loops, much of it associated with the
                        extravagant extensions of three letters, the initial capitals "N" and "S"
                        and the terminal "g." There are also three prominent leafy formations in
                        this area: one at the top of the "S," another growing from the "N" of
                        "Nurse's," and the third in the top left corner. Some of the loopy,
                        vine-like decoration dangles in the left margin, and a large leafy structure
                        occupies the space at the end of short line 5. Below it is a leafy weeping
                        willow tree that leans right; its branches arch down into what may be water.
                        Between stanzas (after lines 5, 9, and 13) and, in the right margin, at the
                        ends of short lines are other vinelike structures. The initial letters of
                        stanzas 2, 3, and 4 have extensions that add to the decoration in the left
                        margin. Several human figures populate the network of interlinear
                        vegetation: two on the "N" of "Nurse's," climbing the left stroke and
                        sitting on a leaf at the end of the curling right stroke; one reaching
                        downward through the following "u," joining hands with another who reaches
                        up from below; one leaning against the "S" of "Song" with head propped on
                        one hand, elbow on knee; one at the top of the "S" of "Song," facing right
                        and reaching overhead to grasp the curling vine above; two beneath "Song" on
                        the long horizontal descender of the "g"; one reclining, with right arm
                        raised horizontally, on the bit of vegetation at the end of line 3 and
                        another(?) in a contracted posture on the leafy structure at the end of line

                    <illusobjdesc>Eight figures gather around a table that sits on grass against a
                        wall of green vegetation. Five figures sit behind the table, away from the
                        viewer; the female at far right extends her arm to hold a drinking glass
                        that rests on the table. Near the ends of the table on the front side, two
                        other figures sit in chairs that are turned sideways, facing one another.
                        Each figure holds a glass on the table. Between them an eighth figure, a
                        male in tights, stands facing away from the viewer. In upraised hands he
                        holds a glass (right) and a plumed hat (left). The faces of all but one of
                        the figures on the far side of the table are visible. The three figures on
                        the near side face away from the viewer toward the rest of the company. The
                        text mentions "green woods," "meadows," and a "table" in "the shade" (lines
                        2, 6, 10-11). The suggestion of a shady refuge is reinforced by the shadows
                        on the ground.</illusobjdesc>

                            are spread; his right leg is straight, his left is extended left, the
                            foot held with its toes pointed. His arms are bent and raised
                            vertically. In his right hand is a wine glass or cup, in his left a hat
                            with a plume. In the context of the poem his actions suggest that he may
                            be singing.</illusobjdesc>

                        plant with two major stems embraces the text of the poem above. The lesser
                        stem, which culminates in a closed blossom or unopened bud, grows in an
                        s-curve up the right margin. The greater stem curves left and then up the
                        left margin. It culminates in a large and lavish blossom whose flame-like
                        petals open into the space above the text. Within the blossom, in place of
                        stamens and pistils, are three figures. At left, a long-haired, gowned
                        female sits holding an infant. Facing right, she looks down at it as she
                        rests her right arm across it. To the right, facing them, stands a winged
                        and gowned female angel who looks down at the infant and holds her hands out
                        toward it. Each of her small wings is marked with a dot. The infant and
                        seated mother(?) may be identified with the two speakers of the poem; there,
                        the infant names itself "Joy" (line 6). A third stem of the plant, with no
                        blossom but with large leaves, grows across the bottom of the plate
                        alongside the major stem; in the center-left margin yet another stem sprouts
                        from the main one. The dots of ink surrounding the head of the woman holding
                        the infant are probably not representational.</illusobjdesc>

                            plant with two major stems embraces the text of the poem above. The
                            lesser stem, which culminates in a drooping closed blossom or unopened
                            bud, grows in an s-curve up the right margin. The greater stem curves
                            left and then up the left margin. It culminates in a large and lavish
                            blossom whose flame-like petals open into the space above the text.
                            Within the blossom, in place of stamens and pistils, are three figures.
                            A third stem of the plant, with no blossom but with large leaves, grows
                            across the bottom of the plate alongside the major stem; in the
                            middle-left margin yet another stem sprouts from the main
                            one.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>A slender tree with leafy branches grows up the right margin,
                        bends under and around the left end of the title—whose lettering harmonizes
                        with the surrounding foliage—and curves back over it. A second tree, much
                        smaller, is also rooted lower right; its branches cross the larger tree
                        above the angel opposite "nest" in line 18. A second branch of the larger
                        tree continues up the right side of the plate to complete the circle around
                        the title. Several leafy branches extend left into the spaces left by short
                        lines of the poem. The tree is loosely encircled by a leafy vine whose
                        termination, perhaps a little beyond the point where the tree bends left, is
                        unclear. Just left of the trees, lower right, a lion lies in a cave with
                        vegetation arching over it. There are winged angelic figures in the tree,
                        one standing with wings (or one wing and an arm) outspread at top right, a
                        second sitting with wings folded on a branch beneath the first, and a third
                        hovering just above the lion's den. Two birds perch on a branch right of
                        line 5. In the left margin are other figures and objects (bottom to top):
                        one gowned, standing on the shadowed ground and facing the third stanza;
                        just above that, a figure with one arm raised; another, arms raised
                        vertically, standing on a sphere (the sun or moon?); just above that
                        another, smaller, with wings and arms outspread. All the figures may be the
                        angels described in the text (Object 16, stanzas 2-3; Object 17, stanza 1).
                        Above the top figure on the left, left of line 5, is another sphere (the sun
                        or moon?); scattered across this same space in the left margin are nine or
                        ten dots, perhaps stars.</illusobjdesc>

                        and a long flag below, and the coil following the final "w," are the most
                        notable. The left margin is dominated by a lattice of branches from two thin
                        trees rooted at bottom left. Leafless below, the branches in the upper
                        reaches of the margin carry the suggestion of leaves, and there are very
                        loopy tendrils beside the first three stanzas that may be a separate vine or
                        part of the tree. A figure playing a pipe stands next to the right tree,
                        lower left. There is a second figure climbing in the branches above,
                        opposite stanza 7. There may also be a third figure with arms raised,
                        opposite stanzas 2 and 3, although the figure merges with the tendrils in
                        this copy. A fourth human form, left of stanza 1, stands facing right with
                        at least one arm raised.</illusobjdesc>

                            left, stands at the base of the tree on the left and plays a pipe. A
                            second figure climbs in the branches above, opposite stanza 7. A third,
                            opposite stanzas 2 and 3, raises his arms as if in supplication—although
                            in this copy the figure is hard to separate from the vines. The final
                            figure, clearly represented left of stanza 1, stands facing right with
                            at least one arm raised vertically.</illusobjdesc>

                            standing in the vines right of lines 10-11, legs spread and arms raised
                            to hold the vegetation above; a figure seated facing left on a vine

                            vine, the other arm extended with the hand on the knee; and a figure
                            walking right at the end of lines 16-17.</illusobjdesc>

                            tiny human figures surrounds the text, especially left, right, and top,
                            and fills spaces between all the stanzas. The dominant form is perhaps
                            the vegetation with flame-like leaves that swirls in the spaces of the
                            right margin (with a more conventional leaf or two at bottom right),
                            underneath the title, and down the left margin. Tendrils extending from
                            both margins help separate the stanzas from one another. The vine right
                            of the final stanza on the plate has several loops suggesting a spiral.
                            The vine full of leaves and flowers(?) that extends across the top of
                            the plate above the title and fills the top right corner and the space
                            right of the first stanza is distinct from the flame-like vegetation
                            that dominates the rest of the plate. Extensions of letters in the title
                            (line 1) contribute to both forms of vegetation: the initial "A" and "C"
                            to the vine above, the "S" to both. In the text of the poem, occasional
                            letters have modest decorative extensions, and there are a few bits of
                            stray decorative vegetation.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>A serpentine plant-like structure with flame-like leaves,
                        apparently rooted at right in the strip of grassy ground that runs across
                        the bottom of the plate, grows along the ground under the last stanza and
                        then up the left margin. Between stanzas three and four the plant forks. One
                        part continues up the left margin and ends under the title. Another part of
                        the plant curves between the third and fourth stanzas and crosses into the
                        right margin, curves back over the title and ends in an upward flourish at
                        top left. The large plant is encircled in its upper reaches by a leafy vine
                        that is rooted, like the plant itself, at the bottom right corner. From
                        there the vine climbs up the right margin right of the standing figure and
                        then, after arching over the figure's head, onto the flame-like plant, which
                        the vine continues to climb, finally terminating just left of the title. A
                        second vine, much shorter, appears in front of the plant at the bottom of
                        the plate, left of the reclining figure. There are several human figures on
                        and around the plants: (at top left) a gowned female with long hair walks
                        right; a second gowned female with long hair floats behind her, pointing
                        right; two figures kneel side by side, facing right, hands raised in prayer;
                        (at bottom right) a gowned figure stands, with an arm extended, perhaps
                        touching the left hand of a nude male figure to the left, who reclines with
                        his right arm braced for support, his left raised vertically; below and in
                        front of this pair, a third figure, perhaps a nude female, reclines,
                        supported on her left arm.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>A gowned, bearded old man stands, playing a large harp, before an
                        audience of perhaps two children—standing in the middle of the group—and six
                        older youths. He may be the bard of the title. To the left stand two young
                        females who embrace. To the right stand the two children and a group of
                        three gowned females who face the bard. At their feet, facing them, kneels
                        another female. All the figures appear to be gowned. The scene is set
                        outdoors on a strip of slightly inclined ground with a dark shadow lower
                        right. A palm-like frond arches over the head of the figure at far right and
                        the vine in the left margin of the text dangles down into this major design
                        above the heads of the embracing couple.</illusobjdesc>

                        "Dream" in the title—seems to be an arc of tasseled grass or grain that
                        curves back over the title. Beneath it—opposite stanzas 1 and 2—are three or
                        four clusters of flame-like leaves or tufts of grass. Below those are a bit
                        of leafy vine (after line 10) and a branch or root of some sort (after line
                        13). In the lower right margin—opposite stanzas 4 and 5—is an odd tree(?).
                        In front of the tree stands a figure, robed, apparently wearing a hat, and
                        holding a staff—probably the "watchman of the night" (line 17), the
                        glow-worm of the text in human form. He is one of four small human figures
                        on the plate. The other three are in the area of the title: lying,
                        presumably sleeping, on the left stroke of the initial "A"; sitting, perhaps
                        reading, in the "D" of "Dream"; and floating or flying, with arms raised
                        horizontally, between bits of vegetation beneath the "e" of "Dream." The
                        animal life of the poem appears in similarly tiny forms in the margins:
                        there could be an ant (the "Emmet" of line 4) beneath the "her" in line 9,
                        another ant or beetle to the right of line 4, and beetles(?) (lines 19-20)
                        flying right of lines 5 and 18. A bird, perhaps an eagle, unmentioned in the
                        text, spreads its wings above "dream" in line 2.</illusobjdesc>

                        one leaf visible, perhaps an anemone pulsatilla. To the left of the treetop
                        a bird—with a long forked tail and wings spread—ascends. (The prominent but

                            right as she points upward with her left arm and with her right arm
                            embraces a young, curly-haired male. He would appear to be nude but
                            might be wearing tights. Three fingers are clearly pictured on her
                            raised left hand. He looks directly at her and embraces her with at
                            least his left arm (note also slight evidence of his right arm just left
                            of the female's back). They may be kissing.</illusobjdesc>
