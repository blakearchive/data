            The William Blake Archive http://www.blakearchive.org is pleased to announce the publication of new electronic editions of <hi rend="i">The Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> Copies R and AA. Copy AA has been reproduced only once previously, as a microfilm many years ago; Copy R has never been reproduced before.<lb/><lb/><hi rend="i">Songs</hi> Copies R and AA are both in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, England. They join copies of <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> in the Archive from other printings: Copies C (1789/1794), F (1789/1794), L (1795), and Z (1826). Copies O and V, from 1795 and c. 1818 printings, are forthcoming.<lb/><lb/>
            The electronic editions have newly edited SGML-encoded texts and new images scanned and color-corrected from first-generation 4x5" transparencies; text and images are each fully searchable and supported by the Inote and ImageSizer applications described in our previous updates.<lb/><lb/>
            With the publication of these two titles, the Archive now contains 39 copies of 18 separate books, including at least one copy of every one of Blake's works in illuminated printing except the 100 plates of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> (forthcoming).<lb/><lb/>
            We are also pleased to announce that the Archive was recently named to the NEH's prestigious EDSITEment list of "Top Humanities Web Sites" http://edsitement.neh.gov/.<lb/><lb/>
            Copy R, printed and colored c. 1795, is of special interest because it was Blake's own copy and, with slight variations, provided the plate order for the last seven copies, printed between 1818 and 1827. This was the first time that Blake printed the <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> and <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> plates in the same session. All copies of <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> produced before Copy R—for example, Copies C and F in the Archive—were compiled from <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> impressions printed in 1789 (either from the raw sienna issue, as in Copy C, or green issue, as in Copy F) and <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> impressions printed in 1794 (either lightly color printed, as in Copy C, or heavily color printed while <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> was still in progress, as in Copy F). And Copy R marks the first time that Blake printed Plates 34-36 ("The Little Girl Lost" and "The Little Girl Found") as <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> plates; in the earlier copies of <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> he printed them as <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> poems and transferred them to <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> at the time of compilation.<lb/><lb/>
            Though Blake printed the <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> and <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> plates in the same session, he apparently meant for them to be separate works. He printed the plates in various shades of greenish and grayish black ink, but did not print the combined title plate, and stabbed and numbered the two parts as separate volumes. He produced Copy R, in other words, almost exactly as he advertised its two separate sections in his prospectus of October 1793, where <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> was not advertised as such, but rather as "Songs of Innocence" and "Songs of Experience," with each part listed as a separate work and described as "Octavo, with 25 designs, price 5s." Almost exactly, but not quite, because Copy R was printed on one side of folio-size leaves and its <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> had only twenty-four designs, since it did not include "To Tirzah," which had not yet been executed, or plate a, which had been used as a tailpiece in Copies B-D.<lb/><lb/><hi rend="i">Songs</hi> Copy R now has the combined title plate and "To Tirzah," but both were inserted late. "To Tirzah" may have been printed and inserted with the copy's impression of "The Tyger," which is watermarked "J Whatman / 1808" (the only impression so marked). Both plates were printed in a solid black ink, not the greenish and grayish black of the other plates, and are numbered sequentially as part of <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> (1-25) and thus must have been inserted before this numbering and the numbering, in the same style and medium, of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> (1-28). The combined title plate was also printed in this solid black ink, but it is unnumbered and may have been printed and/or added later, though almost certainly before Copy R was sold to Linnell in 1819, by which time the pages had been given four framelines, the <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> pages had been renumbered 29-53 to continue the sequence of numbers in <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi>, and many <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> impressions had been recolored.<lb/><lb/>
            Copy R was produced with <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> Copy A as part of a set of illuminated books printed on large paper, approximately 38 x 27 cm., the size of the "I Taylor" paper it shares with Copy A. It was trimmed to 30 x 22 cm. when bound to match Linnell's other illuminated books. Copy R joins other works from the large-paper set now in the Archive (<hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> Copy F, <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> Copy D, <hi rend="i">There is No Natural Religion</hi> Copy L, <hi rend="i">All Religions are One</hi> Copy A, <hi rend="i">America, a Prophecy</hi> Copy A, and <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> Copy G) and forthcoming (<hi rend="i">The First Book of Urizen</hi> Copy B and <hi rend="i">Europe, a Prophecy</hi> Copy H).<lb/><lb/><hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> and <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> were printed together as a single, combined work in 1826 to form <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> Copy Z, which is in the Archive, and Copy AA. Both copies sold for L5.5s., half what Blake listed <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> for in an 1827 letter. Both Copies Z and AA were printed in the same orange ink Blake used ca. 1818 and 1821-22 (works from these sessions include <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> Copy O, which is in the Archive, and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> Copy E, <hi rend="i">America, a Prophecy</hi> Copy O, <hi rend="i">Europe, a Prophecy</hi> Copy K, <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> Copy P, and <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> Copy G, each of which will enter the Archive within the next year). Like the books produced in these sessions, both copies were given single red framelines, though the pen and ink page numbers (1-54) were placed outside rather than inside the frameline.<lb/><lb/>
            In the future, with the release of our revised site interface, users will be able to instantly compare impressions from various copies of an illuminated book within the same browser window. At the moment, users need to open other browser windows to make such comparisons. Doing so with impressions from Copies AA and Z, however, is instructive and well worth the effort. Impressions from the same plate, though printed and colored in the same style, often appear quite different if the text was rewritten or an image was strengthened in pen and ink (either black or red). But this characteristically Blakean bounding line was usually necessitated by an otherwise illegible text or undifferentiated images. Overall, the impressions in Copy AA were better printed and required less pen and ink salvaging than those used to form Copy Z.

the poem, one boy, left, stretches on tiptoe to reach a cluster of grapes on
the left while a second boy, 
right, hands another cluster to a girl who reaches up from the grass
below.  Next to her, walking 
left, is a long-haired male in hat and tights; he holds a bunch of grapes in
his extended left hand.  Next in line, a woman looks down at the infant
in her arms.  A small child stands between her and the next adult to the
left.  In the center, the tallest figure in the group, perhaps "Old John with
white hair" (Object 6, line 13), points forward with his right hand.  A boy
to the left, who faces away from the viewer, holds a bat at his side with
his left hand.  At the front of the procession are a boy and girl, both
looking back toward the rest of the group.  Between them is a kite that
the girl may be holding.  The tinting of the ground below the playful
procession suggests grass, with a river just above the lower margin.  At

Dacre's dream of liberation for himself and his fellow sweeps by an
angel, who releases them from their "coffins of black" to 
run "naked" down a "green plain" and "wash in a river" (lines 14-18). 
Against a leafy background of plants or perhaps trees are twelve(?) small
figures.  At bottom right a gowned and haloed adult bends forward,
reaching toward a nude figure emerging from the earth or one of the
coffins of the text.  Across the 
rest of the bottom of the plate are nude figures standing or running with
their arms raised in various positions.  Two pairs are embracing.  Behind
the gowned adult a tree grows up the right margin and becomes visually
linked to the interlinear decorations.  The tinting of the text area suggests
a sunrise or sunset.  A body of water, probably the "river" of line 18,
appears lower left.</illusobjdesc><component type="object" location="E"><characteristic>sky</characteristic><characteristic>sunrise</characteristic><characteristic>sunset</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The tinting of the text area suggests a sunrise or

The three figures on the near side face away from the viewer toward the

The dominant form is perhaps the vegetation with flame-like leaves that
swirls in the spaces of the 
right margin (with a more conventional leaf or two at bottom right),
underneath the title, and
down the left margin.  Tendrils extending from both margins help
separate the stanzas from one
another.  The vine right of the final stanza on the plate has several loops
suggesting a spiral.  The vine full of leaves and flowers(?) that extends
across the top of the plate above the title and  fills the top right corner
and the space right of the first stanza is distinct from the flame-like 
vegetation that dominates the rest of the plate.  Extensions of letters in
the title contribute to both 
forms of vegetation: the initial "A" and "C" to the vine above, the "S" to
both.  In the text of the 
poem, occasional letters have modest decorative extensions, and there
are a few bits of stray 
decorative vegetation.</illusobjdesc></component></illustration></illusdesc><phystext><texthead justify="left"><l n="songsie.aa.illbk.16.01" justify="left" indent="40"><physnumber type="pen-and-ink">16</physnumber></l></texthead><vspace extent="2"/><texthead justify="left"><l n="songsie.aa.illbk.16.02" justify="left" indent="5">A CRADLE SONG</l></texthead><vspace extent="1"/><lg type="verse" justify="left"><l n="songsie.aa.illbk.16.03" justify="left">Sweet dreams form a shade.</l><l n="songsie.aa.illbk.16.04" justify="left">O'er my lovely infants head,</l><l n="songsie.aa.illbk.16.05" justify="left">Sweet dreams of pleasant streams,</l><l n="songsie.aa.illbk.16.06" justify="left">By happy silent moony beams</l></lg><vspace extent="1"/><lg type="verse" justify="left"><l n="songsie.aa.illbk.16.07" justify="left">Sweet sleep with soft down.</l><l n="songsie.aa.illbk.16.08" justify="left">Weave thy brows an infant crown.</l><l n="songsie.aa.illbk.16.09" justify="left">Sweet sleep Angel mild,</l><l n="songsie.aa.illbk.16.10" justify="left">Hover o'er my happy child.</l></lg><vspace extent="1"/><lg type="verse" justify="left"><l n="songsie.aa.illbk.16.11" justify="left">Sweet smiles in the night,</l><l n="songsie.aa.illbk.16.12" justify="left">Hover over my delight</l><l n="songsie.aa.illbk.16.13" justify="left">Sweet smiles mothers smiles</l><l n="songsie.aa.illbk.16.14" justify="left">All the livelong night beguiles.</l></lg><vspace extent="1"/><lg type="verse" justify="left"><l n="songsie.aa.illbk.16.15" justify="left">Sweet moans. dovelike sighs</l><l n="songsie.aa.illbk.16.16" justify="left">Chase not slumber from thy eyes.</l><l n="songsie.aa.illbk.16.17" justify="left">Sweet moans. sweeter smiles.</l><l n="songsie.aa.illbk.16.18" justify="left">All the dovelike moans beguiles.</l></lg><vspace extent="1"/><lg type="verse" justify="left"><l n="songsie.aa.illbk.16.19" justify="left">Sleep sleep happy child,</l><l n="songsie.aa.illbk.16.20" justify="left">All creation slept and smiles</l><l n="songsie.aa.illbk.16.21" justify="left">Sleep sleep, happy sleep.</l><l n="songsie.aa.illbk.16.22" justify="left">While o'er thee thy mother weep</l></lg><vspace extent="1"/><lg type="verse" justify="left"><l n="songsie.aa.illbk.16.23" justify="left">Sweet babe in thy face.</l><l n="songsie.aa.illbk.16.24" justify="left">Holy image I can trace.</l><l n="songsie.aa.illbk.16.25" justify="left">Sweet babe once like thee.</l><l n="songsie.aa.illbk.16.26" justify="left">Thy maker lay and wept for me</l></lg><vspace extent="1"/><textfoot justify="left"><l n="songsie.aa.illbk.16.27" justify="left" indent="35"><catchword>Wept</catchword></l></textfoot></phystext></desc><desc id="songsie.aa.illbk.17" dbi="songsie.AA.P17"><objtitle>,

flame-like leaves, apparently rooted at right in the strip of grassy ground
that runs across the bottom of 
the plate, grows along the ground under the last stanza and then up the
left margin.  Between 
stanzas three and four the plant forks.  One part continues up the left
margin and ends under the 
title.  Another part of the plant curves between the third and fourth
stanzas and crosses into the 
right margin, curves back over the title and ends in an upward flourish at
top left.  The large plant 
is encircled in its upper reaches by a leafy vine that is rooted, like the
plant itself, at the bottom 
right corner.  From there the vine climbs up the right margin behind the
standing figure and then, 
after arching over the figure's head, onto the flame-like plant, which the
vine continues to climb 
until it terminates just left of the title.  A second vine, much shorter,
appears in front of the plant at the bottom of the plate, left of the
reclining figure.  There are several human 
figures on and around the plants: (at top left) a gowned female with long
hair walks right; a second gowned female, probably with long hair,
floats behind her, pointing right; two figures kneel side by side, facing
right, hands raised in prayer; (at bottom right) a gowned figure stands,
with an arm extended, perhaps touching the left hand of a nude male
figure to the left, who reclines 
with his right arm braced for support, his left raised vertically; below and
in front of this pair, a 
third figure, perhaps a gowned female, reclines, supported on her left
arm.  The green coloring of the ground suggests grass; blue tinting in

the "m" of "Dream" in the title—seems to be an arc of tasseled 
grass or grain that curves back over the title.  Beneath it—opposite
stanzas 1 and 2—are three or four clusters of flame-like leaves or tufts of
grass.  Below those are a bit of leafy vine (after line 11) and a branch or
root of some sort (after line 14).  In the lower right margin—opposite
stanzas 4

the "watchman of the night" (line 18), the glow-worm of the
text in human form.  He is one of four small human figures on the plate. 
The other three are in the area of the title: lying, presumably 
sleeping, on the left stroke of the initial "A"; sitting, perhaps reading, in
the "D" of "Dream"; and floating or flying, with arms raised
horizontally, between bits of vegetation beneath the "e" of "Dream." 

The animal life of the poem appears in similarly tiny forms in the
margins: there could be an ant (the "Emmet" of line 5) to the right of line
5, and perhaps another crawling beneath the "her" in line 10; 
a worm or caterpillar nestled in the lower right sprigs of the vegetation
right of line 7; and a winged beetle(?) (lines 20-21) flying right of line 19 and perhaps another
right of line 6 (partly obscured in this copy).  

A bird, perhaps an
eagle, unmentioned in the text, spreads its wings above "dream" in line

gowned female with long hair reclines, her head apparently supported by
her bent left arm.  She may be the pretty rose tree of the poem.  At her
feet, facing right and to the right of a plant or tuft of grass, is a second
figure, wearing tights and sitting (or perhaps kneeling) hunched over in a
contracted position.  This may be the male speaker of the poem who
"tend[s]" the rose-tree "by day and by night" (line 8).  He holds his
visible hand around his head or on his right shoulder.  In the sky
between the two figures are one large and nine small flying birds.  A
