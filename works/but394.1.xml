Job appears to be telling his story to his three daughters—an event of Blake's own invention. Job̵an aged, bearded, and long-haired patriarch— sits with three daughters (two at his side, one kneeling before him). Job and the daughters left and right sit on a couch with elegantly curved arms.  His arms are raised slightly above the horizontal to point out the pictures on the room's walls.  A rectangular wall picture appears above Job's head, with circular pictures behind his hands right and left.  All three would appear to represent scenes in Job's own life. Job is telling his story visually.  The upper group of pictures shows, from left to right, a group of figures with poles or spears and perhaps other figures huddled below them; God appearing to Job, his wife and friends; and a figure in the sky possibly raining lightning and flames on a plowman who bends sharply backward. Geometrical shapes decorate the floor of the room in which job and his daughters are pictured.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>family</characteristic><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>old</characteristic><characteristic>sitting</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>Job</characteristic><characteristic>father</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>legs spread</characteristic><characteristic>right foot</characteristic><characteristic>hem</characteristic><characteristic>knees</characteristic><characteristic>arms raised horizontally</characteristic><characteristic>arms raised at 135 degrees</characteristic><characteristic>pointing</characteristic><characteristic>hands raised, palms down</characteristic><characteristic>palms down</characteristic><characteristic>fingers</characteristic><characteristic>fingers spread</characteristic><characteristic>mouth open</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Job𓴼aged, bearded, gowned, and with long hair—sits in the center of the design.  His three daughters sit or kneel around him.  He faces forward with his arms raised slightly above the horizontal. His extended hands, fingers slightly spread, point to the paintings on the walls.  The palms of his raised hands face down.  His legs are spread apart, with his bare right foot partly exposed beneath the flowing hem of his garment.  His mouth may be slightly open, as he tells his story, and his knees are prominent.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="object" location="CD"><characteristic>couch</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Job and his daughters to the right and left sit on a couch with elegantly curved arms.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="AC"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>young</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>sitting</characteristic><characteristic>hem</characteristic><characteristic>knees</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>arms bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>hands on breasts</characteristic><characteristic>hands together</characteristic><illusobjdesc>One of Job's daughters sits just to the left of her father.

sharply at the elbow.  A building, possibly a house or barn with a prominent roof, stands far left.
