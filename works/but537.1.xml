                  leg, and right arm.  Satan and the serpent (or his own serpent-self) look at each other, much as Adam and Eve gaze at each other below.  On the right of the design, the sun is visible on the horizon above the sea, suggesting sunrise or sunset.  Beams of light emanate from the sun.  The moon appears near the left border of the

                        lines indicating folds in a cloth or other drapery are visible on his chest.  Death is bearded and wears a pointed, spiky crown.  His right leg is bent and drawn up.  His arms rest on the ground in a position horizontal to his body.  This posture suggests an upside-down crucifixion.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="D"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>Sin</characteristic><characteristic>lying</characteristic><characteristic>supine</characteristic><characteristic>dead</characteristic><characteristic>upside down</characteristic><characteristic>upper body</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>breasts</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>eyes closed</characteristic><characteristic>head toward viewer</characteristic><characteristic>facing up</characteristic><characteristic>arms resting</characteristic><characteristic>arms raised horizontally</characteristic><characteristic>crucified</characteristic><characteristic>palm down</characteristic><characteristic>hand on ground</characteristic><characteristic>heads, multiple</characteristic><characteristic>dog</characteristic><characteristic>snake</characteristic><characteristic>serpent</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Sin lies supine and dead (that is, vanquished) below and to the right of the cross.

                        The heads of three hounds also rest on Sin's torso with their eyes closed.  They are apparently also dead.  A striated, curved shape appears above Sin's torso; this may represent her lower body in serpent form.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="AC"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>angel</characteristic><characteristic>Michael</characteristic><characteristic>partly nude</characteristic><characteristic>drapery</characteristic><characteristic>transparent</characteristic><characteristic>helmet</characteristic><characteristic>crest</characteristic><characteristic>feather</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>eyes raised</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>wing</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>pointing</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised at 135 degrees</characteristic><characteristic>hand raised, palm out</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>arm at side</characteristic><characteristic>arm down</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>spear</characteristic><characteristic>shadow</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The winged angel Michael stands to the left of the cross.
