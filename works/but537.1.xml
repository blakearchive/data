          <illusobjdesc>Adam and Eve kiss while embracing in Eden.  Both figures are nude, and Adam wears a crown or wreath of flowers on his head.  The couple sits on a mound or bed of flowers and leaves; Eve rests on a particularly large leaf.  
                  Large plants bearing leaves (laurel, according to Milton's poem) and slender branches bearing twenty rose blossoms rise left and right of the couple and arch over them.  Other plants cover the ground below the 
                  couple, including several lily-like flowers.  Satan flies or hovers on wings above Adam and Eve with his body horizontal.  A serpent covered in scales encircles Satan's hips, left 
                  leg, and right arm.  Satan and the serpent (or his own serpent-self) look at each other, much as Adam and Eve gaze at each other below.  On the right of the design, the sun is visible on the horizon above the sea, suggesting sunrise or sunset.  Beams of light emanate from the sun.  The moon appears near the left border of the 
                  design and eight stars appear in the sky and on (or in front of or seen through) Satan's body and wings.</illusobjdesc>

                     With his right arm, Adam holds or embraces Eve.  His right hand holds the back of Eve's head with his fingers slightly spread in her hair.  Adam's hair is curly.</illusobjdesc>

            <illusobjdesc>Adam stands below and to the right of the cross.  He is nude with curly hair and is seen from behind.  His left leg is bent back with the left foot on tiptoe.  Adam's left arm is bent upward; his right arm is 
                        not visible, but his hands are held together before his chest in prayer.  Adam's head is turned up in left profile with his eyes raised as he looks toward Christ.  Adam's mouth is open, perhaps in awe.</illusobjdesc>

            <illusobjdesc>Eve lies in a small depression in the earth below the cross.  She is nude and her long, curly hair spreads out on the ground below her.  Eve lies partly on her side; her body is horizontal with her 
                        legs extended together to the right.  Her torso is twisted upward and rests in a supine position.  Her arms are at her sides; her right hand rests on the ground with the palm up while her left palm is down.  
                        Her head is tilted up, but her eyes are closed and she is probably sleeping or in a trance.</illusobjdesc>
