                    <illusobjdesc>The Body of King Edward I lying in his coffin is shown in two views.  Shadows (or perhaps fabric lining the coffin?) darken the area around the figures' head and shoulders.  The figure wears a crown and holds a scepter in his left hand in both views.  The figure at left is more heavily draped with a shroud that covers his face.  The features and accoutrements of the figure at right are visible in greater, though still indistinct, detail.  These include closed eyes, a nose, mouth, and short hair.  Both hands hold scepters in the right view, the left topped with an indistinguishable form and the right in the shape of a cross.  Both feet are visible. The inscriptions above the views identify both bodies as Edward I, the left as he "appeard on first opening the Coffin" and the right "when some of the vestmen/ were remov'd-" (see the Textual Transcription, lines 2, 5-6).</illusobjdesc>
