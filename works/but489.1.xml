    The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of thirty-three of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible.  All take their subjects from the New Testament and have been added to the twenty Old Testament subjects published in March 2010 as “Illustrations to the Bible, c. 1780-1824,” under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.  This new group is presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).
                <lb/><lb/>
                   Blake executed most of these New Testament water colors c. 1800-05 for his patron Thomas Butts.  The exceptions are <hi rend="i">The Whore of Babylon</hi> of 1809 and <hi rend="i">The Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins</hi> in the Yale Center for British Art, datable to c. 1825. The subjects range from the childhood of Jesus to his ascension, the later history of his parents and one of his major followers, St. Paul, and a group of eight designs based on the Book of Revelation.  While the illustrations of the life of Christ are fairly conventional in their subjects, in part because of the long tradition of picturing almost every event in the Gospels, individual motifs recall designs in Blake’s illuminated books and thus offer a window on Blake’s visual interpretation of the Bible. The illustrations of Revelation complement Blake’s intense engagement with apocalyptic events and images in his own poetry.
                    <lb/><lb/>
                        The selection of fifty-three biblical water colors now available in the Archive will be supplemented in the future with early works, such as <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>, datable to c. 1780, and will continue through Blake’s final biblical water colors, such as <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi>. 
                    <lb/><lb/>

In the left foreground sits Jesus, looking right in profile with his body twisted to face away slightly. He reclines with his bent left arm on a pillow, raising his right arm at 45 degrees to gesture to the figure to the right. Jesus's right knee is bent. He wears a gown and has a halo-like aura around his head. He has long, curly hair and a beard. His mouth is slightly open. He may be speaking. His right foot is visible beneath the hem of his gown. The figure second from the left in the foreground is a kneeling or crouching female. She has long, curly hair and wears a gown. She faces left and slightly forward, looking down. Her legs are bent underneath her and her left arm is bent and rests on a cushion or pillow. Her right arm is bent upward and her right hand rests on her head. She may represent Mary (see Luke 10:39). The figure on the far right in the foreground is female, facing left and looking down. She may represent Martha (see Luke 10:40). She wears a gown and has long hair pulled up in a bun. Her left arm is at her side and in her left hand she holds a plate. Her right arm is bent, with the palm out. Her mouth is slightly open. She may be talking. Jesus and Mary in the foreground sit on a cushioned bench or seats, covered in cloth. They each rest on a pillow. 
 In the midground is a table, laid with a tablecloth. On the table are two empty plates or platters, a goblet possibly filled to the brim with wine, and two plates or platters with fruit (including grapes with leaves on them). In the background, in the top corners of the design, hang curtains or draperies. Alternatively, the scene may take place in a tent. At the top center of the design is a menorah with seven leafy branches and lit candles. In the background of the design sit three figures. The leftmost figure is of indeterminable gender, wears a gown and may have curly hair. He or she faces forward and slightly right and has his or her mouth open. He or she may be speaking and also may be looking at Jesus. The middle figure of this group is a gowned old man with long hair and a long beard. He faces forward and looks to the left at Jesus. The rightmost figure is a young man with short, curly hair. He wears a gown and faces right, looking left at Jesus.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="AC"><characteristic>Christ</characteristic><characteristic>sitting</characteristic><characteristic>reclining</characteristic><characteristic>leaning</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>halo</characteristic><characteristic>aura</characteristic><characteristic>radiance</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent at knee</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised at 45 degrees</characteristic><characteristic>pointing</characteristic><characteristic>mouth open</characteristic><characteristic>speaking</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>facing away</characteristic><characteristic>seen from behind</characteristic><characteristic>twisted</characteristic><characteristic>feet</characteristic><illusobjdesc>In the left foreground sits Jesus, looking right and with his body twisted to face away slightly.
