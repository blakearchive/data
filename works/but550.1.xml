              The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the republication of electronic editions of the Thomas Butts and John Linnell series of Blake’s water color illustrations of the <hi rend="i">Book of Job</hi> and the sketchbook of preliminary pencil drawings for his <hi rend="i">Job</hi> engravings.  These three series were previously published in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).  With this republication, those functions now become available, along with our new Related Works feature giving access to related materials through active links on the work index pages and the Show Me menu on the object view pages.  Blake’s <hi rend="i">Job</hi> engravings have been previously published with Image Search and Inote capabilities.  
            <lb/><lb/>
            With this republication, the Archive now includes fully searchable reproductions of all four series of <hi rend="i">Job</hi> designs, among Blake’s greatest achievements as a visual artist.  Thus, characters pictured in the designs, such as Bildad, Eliphaz, and of course Job’s wife, can be searched and located in all four series.  The Archive’s Image Search menu also includes a great many lesser motifs, figure types, postures and gestures.  In coming months, we will publish similarly updated versions of other works presently in Preview mode, including Blake’s nine series of water colors illustrating the poetry of John Milton.
            <lb/><lb/>
            The Archive recently added a new set of scholarly tools that should prove particularly useful when studying Blake’s <hi rend="i">Job</hi> designs.  These tools, known collectively as our Related Works system, are designed to show relationships among works and individual objects in the Archive. They function at two levels.  First, work index pages now include active links to related materials in the Archive.  Thus, researchers can move easily from any given <hi rend="i">Job</hi> series to any other series.  Second, the Show Me menu on object view pages now includes Related Works in the Archive.  Like the work-level menu, this list includes active links to related designs and is meant to allow study of the related materials side by side.  For example, researchers can move quickly from Blake’s engraving of Behemoth and Leviathan to its drawing in the sketchbook and study how Blake developed his design from preliminary sketch to finished engraving.
            <lb/><lb/>
            As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.

            February 2002:
            <lb/><lb/>
            The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of Blake's first group of twenty-one water colors illustrating the Book of Job. These were created on commission for Blake's major patron, Thomas Butts, as a series of nineteen water colors c. 1805-06; two further designs were added to the group at a later date, probably c. 1821-27. While Blake had drawn and engraved some important designs based on Job in earlier years, the Butts set of water colors is his first attempt to create a pictorial narrative of the whole story, from what Blake believed to be Job's misapprehensions about God, through Job's torments at the hands of Satan, to the restoration of Job's physical and spiritual wellbeing. The later set of Job water colors that Blake executed for John Linnell and the famous engraved series were both based on this earlier, Butts group.<lb/><lb/>
            The release of Blake's Job water colors is particularly significant because it marks our first publication of Blake's "Non-Illuminated Works." This new "wing" of the Archive will gradually be populated with Blake engravings, paintings, drawings, manuscripts, and typographic editions. In the near future, we will add such important works as the Job engravings and water color illustrations to the poetry of John Milton, Thomas Gray, and Edward Young.<lb/><lb/>
            In the interest of publishing the greatest number of high-quality images in the shortest span of time, we are introducing to the Archive a new "Preview mode." Like the current presentation of Blake's illuminated books in the Archive, works in Preview will be in full and accurate color, with enlargements, and with searchable transcriptions of any texts, including even the briefest of inscriptions. The only functions that will not be available in Preview are image search and Inote. Thus, works in Preview will not offer descriptions of visual motifs, nor will those visual motifs be searchable. The advantage of this slightly reduced mode of display is that we will be able to add works to the Archive more expeditiously. All works in Preview will bear a clear indication that they are indeed in "Preview," both in all relevant tables of contents and on the basic Object View page. As we add many works in Preview, we will gradually shift them toward fully functional displays that will make image search and Inote available. The Job water colors announced here are currently available in Preview mode.<lb/><lb/>
            At present the Archive contains, in addition to the Job water colors in Preview, 41 copies of 18 of Blake's 19 illuminated books, plus a fully SGML-encoded electronic edition of David V. Erdman's <hi rend="i">Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</hi>. In the near future we expect to release more drawings and prints in Preview; a much-anticipated electronic edition of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> Copy E, fully encoded for image search and Inote; and a collection of handlists for each of the Archive's contributing institutions as well as improved, searchable versions of our bibliographies. Future supplementary materials include a biography and glossary.<lb/><lb/>
            As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible through the continuing support of the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia, by a major grant from the Preservation and Access Division of the National Endowment for the Humanities, by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and by the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to represent works from their collections in the Archive.

Job raises his hands as if in prayer; his wife lifts her hands,

lower portion.  Her right hand is on her breast as 
she leans toward her husband.  Her left hand holds his right upper arm.  
Job holds a rectangular object, probably half a loaf of bread, in his 
right hand.  With his left hand he gives a similar half-loaf to an old 
man with a crutch and a dog on a leash.  Behind the recipient of Job's 
charity is a winged angel.  Another winged angel hovers on the left.  The near foreground features what may be a mound of earth, or, perhaps, a dirt road.  
The middle distance contains grassy hills and the outlines of what are probably bushes or trees.  
On the left is a structure suggestive of a Druid trilithon, except that it has three rather 
than two columns. Beside this structure are what appear to be fragments of other pillars, 
indicative of ruins. The horizon is defined by distant mountains with clouds above.  The upper portion portrays several dramatic figures, particularly 
Satan.  
He is nude, though his genital region is obscured, perhaps by scales.  Flames ascend to the right 
from behind Satan's extended legs and right hand. The flames below his left arm and hand point downward.  He holds a vial in his right hand from which a liquid(?), perhaps 
indicative of pestilence, descends on Job.  On the left, eight(?) figures hover among flames, probably angels 
although without wings.  On the right are nine(?) more angels similarly arranged in the ascending flames.  
Smoke, or perhaps clouds, encircle Satan and these angelic figures.  In the center of this oval composition, God sits on a 
stone throne, raised on a plinth.  He faces forward, with his head turned to the right and slightly down, holding a book 
in his right hand and a scroll in his left.  Radiance and beams of light surround his head and upper body.  </illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="CD"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>gowned</characteristic><characteristic>Job</characteristic><characteristic>old</characteristic><characteristic>sitting</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>legs crossed</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>lap</characteristic><characteristic>fingers</characteristic><characteristic>right foot</characteristic><characteristic>hem</characteristic><characteristic>arm on lap</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised horizontally</characteristic><characteristic>arms bent</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>giving</characteristic><illusobjdesc id="d0e4638">Job sits at the center in the lower half of the

                  slightly open and tears running down his cheeks and long beard.  He is 
                  nude above the waist; a piece of rough (burlap?) cloth covers his loins 
                  and legs.  His hands are down by his thighs, palms out.  The mottled textures 
                  on his upper body, lower arms, and palms indicate 
                  the boils that plague him.  His eyes are turned  
                  upward, as though he is beseeching his God.  His posture, visage, and 
                  gestures suggest pain and despair.  Job's wife sits far left, her head 
                  twisted toward her husband.  Her hair is long; her face now looks a good 
                  deal older than in earlier scenes.   Both feet extend from under the hem of her gown.  Her knees are drawn up 
                  sharply toward her chest, with both arms wrapped around them.  Her hands 
                  are open, fingers spread, in a gesture that suggests she is questioning 
                  Job and his fate.  Job's three friends (probably Eliphaz, Bildad, and 
                  Zophar, front to back) sit, squat, or stand on the right.  They are 
                  gowned and point accusatory arms, hands, and fingers at Job.  The middle 
                  distance is filled with a low hill, perhaps covered with vegetation.  A bit of vegetation, 
                  probably grass, adorns the foreground.   A large pillar, or section of a wall, anchors the left 
                  margin. The horizon is defined by dark mountains; above, the sky is stormy, with dark clouds. </illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>old</characteristic><characteristic>Job</characteristic><characteristic>partly nude</characteristic><characteristic>drapery</characteristic><characteristic>cloth</characteristic><characteristic>loincloth</characteristic><characteristic>kneeling</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>flesh</characteristic><characteristic>disease</characteristic><characteristic>plague</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>tears</characteristic><characteristic>crying</characteristic><characteristic>mouth open</characteristic><characteristic>eyes raised</characteristic><characteristic>despair</characteristic><characteristic>pain</characteristic><characteristic>arms at side</characteristic><characteristic>arms down</characteristic><characteristic>palms facing viewer</characteristic><characteristic>fingers</characteristic><characteristic>fingers spread</characteristic><illusobjdesc id="d0e7595">Job kneels, facing forward, on his bed of straw, center

All are winged and partly nude, with indications of knee-length gowns or drapery; their arms overlap 
at 135 degree angles.  Inscriptions in the engraved version of this design indicate that these figures are probably personifications of stars.   
The middle section is anchored by the ancient figure of God kneeling in 
the center of the design.  His arms are outstretched horizontally.  
Beneath God's right arm is a youthful male riding (or possibly hovering above) one or more of the four horses beneath him.  
The halo or sun disc and the surrounding radiance suggest that he is a sun god, perhaps Apollo.  Beneath God's left arm is a winged female 
holding the reins of two serpents.  The crescent moon above her head 
identifies her as a moon goddess, probably Diana or Hecate.  Job and his 
wife sit or kneel in the lowest section of the design.  On the right are 
Job's three friends.  Given our identifications of the friends in Object 7, these are, from right to left, Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar.

Two large angels hover nearby, right and left.  Tongues of flame

To the right of Job's wife is a hill, or perhaps, a stone.  They are on the edge of a cliff that drops off sharply 
to the right of the figures, and from which issues the fires of hell.  Job's three friends

right they are a youthful male playing double pipes; two of his brothers 
playing horns; another young son playing a curled horn; a youthful 
daughter holding a scroll and possibly singing; Job's wife, playing a mandolin; a young daughter holding a 
scroll (possibly another musical score) and perhaps singing; Job, 
playing a large triangular harp; a young female playing a lyre; a son 
playing a curled horn and another playing a large harp; and a final 
youthful male holding a pipe, his mouth open perhaps in song.  The 
instruments hung in the tree in the first scene of the drama are now 
used to praise God.  The great (oak?) tree from the opening scene again 
anchors the middle of the design; a sun appears over a distant mountain 
range on the right, and a crescent moon and one star (or planet) appear in 
the sky on the left.  Seven sheep, including one ram, and a dog lie on 
grass in the foreground.  A flock of sheep appear behind the legs of the
