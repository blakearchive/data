This is the only extant impression from this printing session.  Butlin 304 suggests that there may have been another impression shown to John Ruskin c. 1843 and later owned by Arthur Burgess, who died in 1887.  If such an impression did exist, it was very probably printed in 1795.

A "voice from heaven" tells the Babylonian monarch that he will "be with the beasts of the field."  The prophecy is fulfilled immediately, and Nebuchadnezzar grows "hairs ... like eagles' feathers" and "nails like birds' claws."  For Blake, this image probably represented the descent of a mighty ruler, and perhaps all of humanity, into a state of fallen nature.</p></objnote><objsize>42.1 x 60.6 cm.</objsize><windowsize width="600" height="550"/></physdesc><illusdesc><illustration type="plate" location="E"><illusobjdesc>Nebuchadnezzar, transformed into a nude, beast-like figure with claw-like nails and long, shaggy hair and beard, crawls towards the right but turns his head to face the viewer.

His right foot has its toes spread on tiptoe, perhaps digging into the ground.  His facial expression is a mixture of despair and sorrow; his eyes look blankly toward the viewer.
