    The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of thirty-three of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible.  All take their subjects from the New Testament and have been added to the twenty Old Testament subjects published in March 2010 as “Illustrations to the Bible, c. 1780-1824,” under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.  This new group is presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).
                <lb/><lb/>
                   Blake executed most of these New Testament water colors c. 1800-05 for his patron Thomas Butts.  The exceptions are <hi rend="i">The Whore of Babylon</hi> of 1809 and <hi rend="i">The Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins</hi> in the Yale Center for British Art, datable to c. 1825. The subjects range from the childhood of Jesus to his ascension, the later history of his parents and one of his major followers, St. Paul, and a group of eight designs based on the Book of Revelation.  While the illustrations of the life of Christ are fairly conventional in their subjects, in part because of the long tradition of picturing almost every event in the Gospels, individual motifs recall designs in Blake’s illuminated books and thus offer a window on Blake’s visual interpretation of the Bible. The illustrations of Revelation complement Blake’s intense engagement with apocalyptic events and images in his own poetry.
                    <lb/><lb/>
                        The selection of fifty-three biblical water colors now available in the Archive will be supplemented in the future with early works, such as <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>, datable to c. 1780, and will continue through Blake’s final biblical water colors, such as <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi>. 
                    <lb/><lb/>

To the left of the design stand the five wise virgins, each one wearing a gown with a head veil over her long hair and holding a lit oil lamp hanging on chains. The leftmost figure faces left. She appears to have curly hair and holds her lamp in her left hand, with her left arm at her side. The second-to-left figure stands, facing forward and perhaps looking to her right. She holds her lamp in her left hand, and her right arm is at her side. The middle figure faces forward but turns her head to face left. She appears to have curly hair. She bends her right arm across her torso. Her left arm is at her side, though slightly bent, and she holds her lamp in her left hand. The second-to-right figure has her body twisted so that the lower half faces left while the upper half faces forward. She looks up and to the right and has her mouth open. She may also have curly hair. Her left arm is bent upward, with the fingers spread. Her right arm is at her side and she holds her lamp in that hand. The rightmost figure stands in contrapposto so that her body faces forward and the lower half faces slightly left. She looks to the right and holds her left arm horizontally, pointing with her left hand. Her right arm is at her side and she holds her lamp in her right hand. Her mouth may be slightly open; she may be speaking. On the right side of the design are the five foolish virgins, each wearing a gown as well as a head veil over her long hair. The leftmost figure kneels with her left leg extended backward. She faces forward and to the left, looking up at the rightmost wise virgin. Her right arm is raised at 135 degrees, reaching for the figure to her left, while her left arm is raised at 45 degrees. In her left hand she holds an unlit oil lamp on a chain. Her mouth is open; she may be speaking. The second-to-left figure of this group faces away, but looks up and to the left. She may be walking or standing. Her left leg is extended backward and her left foot is on tiptoe. Her left arm, though bent, is raised horizontally. Her right arm, though bent, is raised vertically and in her right hand she holds her veil. Her mouth may be open. The middle figure of this group faces right and down and may be standing or walking. She bends forward and bends her arms upward to hold her hands to her face. In her left hand she holds the chain to her extinguished lamp. The second-to-right figure kneels, facing forward and slightly right, though looking up and to the left. Her arms are bent with her hands to the sides of her face, perhaps in fists or perhaps clutching her head veil. Her mouth may be partly open. The rightmost figure kneels, or may be in the process of standing up, facing forward and slightly right, though looking up and to the left. Her right knee is bent and her arms are raised at 135 degrees and bent upward. Her right hand holds her veil and her left hand holds the chain of her extinguished lamp. Her mouth is partly open. The scene takes place at night and thus is dark. The virgins stand on a patch of bare earth. In the left background are hills or mountains and in the right background a city with at least six buildings, including three spires, a dome, and possibly a tower, is visible. On the right side of the design is a house or hut with a roof and open doorway. The night sky appears to be cloudy. Along the top of the design flies or hovers a spectral figure, possibly an angel, of indeterminable gender. Its body is horizontal and it wears a gown and appears to have long, slightly curly hair. Its left arm is extended horizontally and in its left hand it holds a horn or trumpet to its lips, which it presumably blows.
