                        dimensions (height x width) are given according to the vertical orientation
                        of the body of Blake's letter; see the note on Number of Leaves, below.
                        Object 1 has been reoriented vertically in the Object View Page, as would be
                        customary when reading the address.</note></objsize>
                <numberleaves>2<note>The full sheet was folded to form two leaves. The letter
                        appears on the first recto (object 2), first verso (object 3), and second
                        recto (object 4) of the folded sheet. This folded sheet was folded further
                        to form a sealed packet for posting. The address appears on the second verso
                        (object 1), which would have been the exterior of the folded packet. The
                        letter appears to have been repaired along the corner of the leaf containing
                        objects 1 and 4, probably where a wafer seal was torn open. Traces of what
                        appear to be a wafer seal, no longer present, are visible along the edges of
                        the folded letter.</note>
