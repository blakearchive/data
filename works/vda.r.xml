                        <updatestmt>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the
                                publications of a digital edition of <hi rend="i">Visions of the
                                        Daughters of Albion</hi> copy R from the Bayerische
                                Staatsbibliothek, Munich; colored impressions of <hi rend="i"
                                        >Visions</hi> plates 1, 2, and 3 from the Morgan Library and
                                Museum; a proof of <hi rend="i">Visions</hi> plate 6 from the
                                Fitzwilliam Museum that belongs to our previously published copy a;
                                and five monochrome wash drawings for the wood engravings in
                                Thornton’s Virgil added to the seven previously published designs.<lb/>
                                <lb/><hi rend="i">Visions</hi>, extant in eighteen complete copies,
                                consists of eleven relief-etched plates executed and first printed
                                in 1793. Blake initially printed <hi rend="i">Visions</hi> on both
                                sides of six quarto-size leaves in a print run of eleven copies, in
                                yellow ochre (as in copy A), raw sienna (copies B, C, and E), and
                                green (copies H, I, and J), and he finished the impressions in light
                                watercolor washes. Copy R represents a complete departure from this
                                early mode of producing illuminated books. It was printed in 1794
                                with copy F in thick colors from the shallows and surfaces of the
                                plates on large sheets of folio size paper to produce impressions
                                resembling oil sketches or paintings rather than watercolor
                                drawings. Examples of the full leaf can be seen in "Supplemental
                                Views" in the navigation bar below the images of Objects 1 and 10. <lb/>
                                <lb/>With this publication the Archive is introducing a new category
                                of graphic works, referred to in the index of copies of a work as
                                Miscellaneous Plates and Impressions, which allows us to group
                                together a work’s proofs, impressions in different states,
                                posthumous impressions, and lifetime impressions not used or
                                extracted from copies. The three loose impressions of plates from
                                        <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> at the
                                Morgan Library and Museum were printed in the green of copies H, I,
                                and J and finished in watercolors in Blake's early style, but they
                                appear not to have belonged to a copy. These three plates from <hi
                                        rend="i">Visions</hi> can be accessed like plates in other
                                copies of a work and compared with other impressions from the same
                                matrix using the "Objects from the Same Matrix" feature in the
                                second navigation bar below the image. The Archive will gradually
                                publish groups of miscellaneous prints and proofs for each
                                illuminated book (some groups consisting of upward of fifty
                                impressions), which will enable users to trace the evolution of
                                Blake's printed designs.<lb/>
                                <lb/><hi rend="i">Visions</hi> copy a consists of uncolored
                                impressions of six plates printed in black ink; plates 1 and 2 are
                                of the full plate, but plates 3, 7, 9, and 10 were cut from their
                                leaves and show just the vignettes. The loose impression in the
                                Fitzwilliam Museum is similarly cut from plate 6 and appears
                                certainly to have once belonged to the set of proofs making up copy a.<lb/>
                                <lb/>The Archive is also pleased to announce the addition of five of
                                Blake's monochrome wash drawings for "The Pastorals of Virgil" to
                                the seven drawings that had previously been available. The drawings
                                can be examined in comparison with their finished wood engravings by
                                using the "Objects from the Same Production Sequence" feature in the
                                second navigation bar below the image. The addition of the new
                                drawings marks the first time that the Archive has published a work
                                from the Beinecke Library. Accordingly, we are also publishing the
                                Beinecke's Blake collection list, which includes all of its original
                                works by Blake, not just those published in the Archive. We have
                                also recently published the collection lists for the Brooklyn
                                Museum, Cleveland Museum of Art, Houghton Library, Mead Art Museum,
                                Minneapolis Institute of Art, National Gallery of Scotland, and
                                Rhode Island School of Design. Under "Resources for Further
                                Research," the Archive now offers thirty-eight collection lists of
                                contributing institutions.<lb/>
                                <lb>All works in the Archive are accessible via the Table of
                                        Contents, which is accessible via the "sandwich" button at
                                        the right end of the banner. This drops down a second banner
                                        that identifies the categories of works in the Archive:
                                        Illuminated books, Commercial Book Illustrations, Separate
                                        Prints and Prints in Series, Drawings and Paintings,
                                        Manuscripts and Typographic Works. To further improve
                                        accessibility to the works, we've added a Table of Contents
                                        item, "All Works," which twice lists all of the works in the
                                        Archive without categorizing them according to medium. One
                                        list puts the works in alphabetical order and the other in
                                        order of composition date. The latter list would of course
                                        be of interest to any Blake scholars mindful of the
                                        historical progression of Blake's works.</lb>
                                <lb/>With the publication of <hi rend="i">Visions</hi> copy R, the
                                Archive now contains fully searchable and scalable digital editions
                                of 106 copies of Blake's nineteen illuminated books—including twelve
                                other copies of <hi rend="i">Visions</hi>. Users may view
                                color-corrected digital images of Blake's works at their true size,
                                and enlarge and rotate these images to examine the text and
                                illustrations in detail. The images are accompanied by diplomatic
                                transcriptions and editors' notes, as well as illustration
                                descriptions that make it possible to search Blake's works for
                                visual motifs. The Archive also provides full bibliographic and
                                provenance information for each digital edition it publishes. Though
                                the Archive retains its focus on the material conditions of Blake's
                                art, presenting images in the context of works and copies, the newly
                                designed site contextualizes each work, copy, and object in a
                                network of relations. Users of the site can view each Blakean object
                                alongside objects in the same copy, objects printed from the same
                                matrix, objects from the same production sequence, and objects with
                                similar designs. This contextualization, which draws on the
                                expertise of the Archive's editors, enables comparisons across time,
                                medium, and genre, and foregrounds the immense variety and the
                                recurring themes of Blake's art.<lb/>
                                <lb/>As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing
                                no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site
                                is made possible by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
                                with the University of Rochester, the continuing support of the
                                Library of Congress, and the cooperation of the international array
                                of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to
                                reproduce works from their collections in the Archive. </updatestmt>

                                        <illusobjdesc>Three nude figures are seen within the mouth
                                                of a cave that opens onto the sea. Heavy clouds fill
                                                the sky, but fail to cover the disc of the sun. The
                                                open area where the sun appears suggests an eye
                                                socket, perhaps in a skull outlined by the cave and
                                                seen in left profile. Indeterminate vegetation
                                                dangles from the roof of the cave. The figures sit
                                                or kneel on large stones, or possibly sand below the
                                                central female. On the left is a heavily-muscled and
                                                bearded male seen in left profile. He sits or squats
                                                at the cave's mouth. He looks to the left with
                                                wide-open eyes; his face is deeply marked by fear or
                                                worse; his hair stands on end. His mouth is open and
                                                he may be howling. His knees are drawn up in a
                                                contracted position; his left arm is drawn backwards
                                                as though bound behind him. Large shackles are
                                                attached to both his ankles. Two, possibly three,
                                                links of a massive chain descend from his ankle
                                                shackles, and he may be bound back to back with the
                                                female directly to the right. This pair is probably
                                                Oothoon, the central female figure in the poem, and
                                                her tormentor Bromion. She kneels, with her body
                                                bent down and to the right. Her long hair cascades
                                                over her neck and down behind her head. Her eyes may
                                                be closed, or at least sharply downcast. Above her
                                                and to the right, an extremely contracted figure
                                                sits among rocks. This is probably Theotormon,
                                                Oothoon's ineffectual lover. His legs appear to be
                                                crossed, with the left foot prominently poised below
                                                his heavy knees. The red coloring of the rock
                                                beneath his foot may indicate blood. He faces down
                                                so that we see only the top of his head, covered
                                                with curly hair. His arms are wrapped around his
                                                head, with the left arm bent at the elbow and his
                                                left hand, perhaps clutching his curly hair. His
                                                right arm descends along the right side of his
                                                hidden face and disappears beneath his left elbow.
                                                The design may illustrate the following lines on
                                                plate 5: "Bound back to back in Bromions caves
                                                terror &amp; meekness dwell / At entrance Theotormon
                                                sits wearing the threshold hard" (lines 7-8). Given
                                                this textual parallel, the two figures on the left
                                                may be personifications of terror (note the
                                                expression on Bromion's face) and
                                                meekness.</illusobjdesc>

                                                  wide-open eyes; his face is deeply marked by fear
                                                  or worse; his flame-like hair stands on end. His
                                                  mouth is open and he may be howling. His knees are
                                                  drawn up in a contracted position; his left arm is
                                                  drawn backwards as though bound behind him. Large
                                                  shackles are affixed to his ankles. Two, possibly
                                                  three, links of a massive chain descend from his
                                                  ankle shackles. This is probably Bromion, the
                                                  tormentor of the central female figure in the
                                                  text, Oothoon. He may also be a personification of
                                                  terror—see the following lines on plate 5: "Bound
                                                  back to back in Bromions caves terror &amp;

                                                  wearing the threshold hard" (lines 7-8).

                                                  figure in the poem, and her tormentor Bromion. Her

                                                  Theotormon, Oothoon's ineffectual lover. His legs

                                                  prominently poised below his heavy knees. The red
                                                  coloring of the rock beneath his foot may indicate
                                                  blood. He faces forward and down so that we see

                                        <illusobjdesc>The title page is a seascape, with two
                                                storm-tossed waves in the lower margin, heavy
                                                clouds, slight indications of rain, and at least
                                                eleven human figures. The angle of the waves
                                                suggests a strong wind blowing from left to right. A
                                                nude female runs toward us with her right foot
                                                touching a trough between waves, lower center. She
                                                is probably the central female figure in the poem,
                                                Oothoon, who "over the waves ... went" (plate 4,
                                                line 16). Her left leg is extended behind her, her
                                                arms are raised at 135 degrees, and the fingers of
                                                both hands are separated and extended. She appears
                                                to look up and to the right; her long hair streams
                                                back and to the right as though blown by a wind. A
                                                blood-red cloud (of smoke?) fills the background
                                                behind her and appears to be billowing up from her
                                                right foot. She may be looking at the figure
                                                hovering in the air above her, a bearded male who
                                                directly faces the viewer and may be pursuing
                                                Oothoon. This threatening male may be Bromion,
                                                Oothoon's tormentor in the poem; or Urizen, the evil
                                                sky-god (among other attributes) also named in the
                                                text. We see only his head and face, shoulders, and
                                                arms and hands wrapped around his shoulders in a
                                                contracted posture. His large wings extend
                                                horizontally. His face is heavily lined,
                                                particularly the forehead, and his mouth is open.
                                                Flames spring from below his wings and rise above
                                                them. To the left is a ring of three female figures
                                                pictured as though nude but with the twisted,
                                                spiraling hems of gowns trailing behind them. They
                                                form a circle, as though participating in an
                                                ecstatic dance. The figure at the bottom of the
                                                circle holds hands with her two companions. Her arms
                                                are extended horizontally and her legs are spread
                                                apart as though she were striding energetically to
                                                the right. Her head probably faces away from the
                                                viewer and to the right. The dancer furthest to the
                                                left also has her arms extended horizontally
                                                (relative to her body); her head is tilted back as
                                                though she were looking up. Like her companion
                                                below, a strand of long hair extends from her head.
                                                The final dancer, top right in the circle, has her
                                                arms raised at 135 degrees and has her legs spread.
                                                Her back and neck are arched backwards. Above the
                                                ring of dancers, and just left of the first diagonal
                                                of the letter "A" of "Albion" in line 4, is a
                                                slender, nude figure seen from the side with at
                                                least one arm extended downward. She may be holding
                                                a small scepter in her extended hand. This figure,
                                                probably female, seems to be descending head-first.
                                                To the left of this figure, near the left margin of
                                                the plate, is a nude figure, probably female, seen
                                                from the side and sitting on a cloud. Her left leg,
                                                the only one visible, is drawn up towards her head,
                                                which is tilted down and to the left. Her left arm,
                                                which we see only from the shoulder to the elbow,
                                                extends behind her as though it is propping her up
                                                or possibly bound behind her. To the right of these
                                                two figures, and near the center of the plate, is a
                                                figure, probably female and gowned, sitting on a
                                                cloud just above the letters "b" and "i" of "Albion"
                                                in line 4. She faces to the left and we see only her
                                                left side. Her upper body and head are bent over at
                                                such a sharp angle that they touch her upper left
                                                leg. In this contracted posture, her long hair
                                                cascades over her left knee. Higher along the left
                                                margin of the design and left of the first "of" in
                                                the title inscription are two figures on a cloud.
                                                Both appear to be nude; at least the one on the left
                                                is probably female. We see this figure on the left
                                                from behind. Her upper body is bent over, with her
                                                left arm extending downwards (almost touching the
                                                head of the figure below) and her long hair
                                                cascading downwards. Her right arm is bent sharply
                                                at the elbow as though braced for support or
                                                balance. Her companion to the right lies on the
                                                cloud, with her or his prominent knees on the left
                                                in a twisted and contracted posture. We apparently
                                                see only the top of her or his head; the figure may
                                                be looking down. The left arm is bent at the elbow
                                                with the left hand beneath the head. To the right,
                                                and right of the word "of" in line 2, is a nude male
                                                with legs crossed. He sits on a cloud. His hair is
                                                long; he faces down and to the right. He leans to
                                                the right, with arms raised at 45 degrees (but
                                                horizontally relative to his body) and extended
                                                downward and to the right. The fingers of both hands
                                                are spread and extended as though he were casting
                                                down the slight indications of rain lower in the
                                                design. A rainbow arches dramatically from lower
                                                left, through the ring of dancers, and ends below
                                                the figure with crossed legs upper right. The words
                                                of the title are integrated into the design and seem
                                                to float on clouds. The motto and imprint appear to
                                                float on the sea below the two waves.</illusobjdesc>

                                        <illusobjdesc>A young nude woman kneels on the ground and
                                                leans to the right with her right arm bent forward
                                                and placed between her breasts. Her hair appears to
                                                be drawn back in a bun, yet a few strands of long
                                                hair curl down her back. She might be kissing a much
                                                smaller figure, probably also female, although this
                                                "kiss" is less clear than in some other copies. The
                                                second nude figure is seen from behind; her arms are
                                                extended horizontally. Her right foot is poised
                                                beside one of the two flowers, probably marigolds,
                                                growing on a plant lower right. Her left leg is bent
                                                at the knee in a dance-like posture. The kneeling
                                                figure is probably Oothoon, the smaller figure
                                                probably the "nymph" who personifies the marigold.
                                                As the text on plate 4 explains, "Oothoon wandered
                                                in woe, / Along the vales of Leutha seeking flowers
                                                to comfort her; / And thus she spoke to the bright
                                                Marygold of Leutha's vale / Art thou a flower! art
                                                thou a nymph! I see thee now a flower; / Now a
                                                nymph!" (lines 5-9). Given this textual point of
                                                contact, the landscape is Leutha's Vale, also named
                                                in the text on this plate. The hovering nymph may
                                                also be identified with Leutha (see "Leutha's
                                                flower," line 7). The earth on which the figure
                                                kneels is colored as though covered with grass.
                                                Bursts of radiance fill the sky; they would seem to
                                                emanate from a sun just below the horizon on the
                                                right. A beam of light may be emanating from the
                                                marigold furthest to the right.</illusobjdesc>

                                                  female, is seen from behind. Her right foot is
                                                  poised beside a flower from which she may be
                                                  rising. Her arms are extended horizontally and her
                                                  left knee bent forward. This dance-like posture
                                                  includes a gracefully twisted torso. She might be
                                                  kissing the much larger female on the left,
                                                  although this "kiss" is less clear than in some
                                                  other copies because the smaller figure's head
                                                  does not appear to be bent back. Given the textual
                                                  parallels for the design, this small figure is
                                                  probably the "nymph" who personifies the marigold
                                                  flower below her (plate 4, line 8). She may also
                                                  be identified with Leutha (see "Leutha's flower,"

                                                  appears lower right in the landscape. Two arching

                                        <illusobjdesc>Five figures sport in the sky surrounding the
                                                letters of the heading ("Visions," line 2). Top
                                                left, a nude figure, probably female, sits on top of
                                                the first diagonal of the letter "V." She faces
                                                left, with her left knee bent and her right leg
                                                extended below her. She holds in her left hand and
                                                to her mouth a curled horn; she is very probably
                                                playing this musical instrument. To the right, just
                                                above the first "i," is a billowing cloud with a
                                                long trailing edge. On it sits a figure who is
                                                probably female. She shows slight indications of a
                                                gown or drapery, but may be unclothed in this copy.
                                                She sits on the cloud sidesaddle, as though it were
                                                a horse. Her legs are crossed and her head rests on
                                                her left hand—a posture traditionally associated
                                                with melancholy. Further to the right are two
                                                energetic male nudes. Both hover in the air with
                                                their legs extended and their bodies twisted. The
                                                male above the letters "o" and "n" draws his bow,
                                                held in his right hand with the bowstring pulled
                                                back by his left hand. The arrow, pointed down and
                                                to the left, has not yet been released. His
                                                companion to the right holds his bow below him in
                                                his right hand. Neither a bowstring nor an arrow are
                                                pictured; perhaps he has just released the latter.
                                                His left arm is bent and appears to reach behind his
                                                head; perhaps he is reaching for another arrow (not
                                                pictured). Below the final letter of the heading is
                                                a hovering figure, very probably female. The long
                                                hem of her gown trails off to the top right in
                                                several snake-like curves. She faces to the left,
                                                with at least one arm extended horizontally. She may
                                                be holding something in her left hand; a few
                                                vertical lines indicate that some liquid is falling
                                                from her hand or what she holds.</illusobjdesc>

                                                On the right is a muscular male, also lying on his

                                                <illusobjdesc>A muscular nude male lies supine. His
                                                  right arm is extended horizontally and his
                                                  barely-visible head twisted backward. His legs are
                                                  bent at the knees; the left leg is lifted
                                                  vertically and his right leg turned down and to
                                                  the left. This posture suggests that the figure is
                                                  dead—or perhaps Bromion exhausted after he has

                                        <illusobjdesc>A nude female lies supine on a cloud. Her left
                                                arm is extended horizontally to the right (but
                                                raised vertically relative to her body). Her long
                                                hair can be seen above her left forearm. Her head is
                                                thrown back and her belly exposed. Her legs are
                                                spread apart and bent back sharply at the knees so
                                                we see only her upper legs. This posture suggests
                                                erotic (or at least highly emotional) abandon. Above
                                                her hovers a large bird, probably an eagle. The bird
                                                seems to descend upon the female, with its beak
                                                touching her torso between her stomach and breasts.
                                                Above the bird's wing on the right is another
                                                cloud—or an extension of the cloud on which the
                                                female lies. The female is probably Oothoon since,
                                                on plate 5, she is described as "calling" upon
                                                "Theotormons Eagles to prey upon her flesh" (line
                                                15). Background coloring suggests a sunrise or
                                                sunset.</illusobjdesc>

                                                giant wave, shaped like a tongue of flame. Within
                                                this wave is a nude female, shackled and chained on
                                                her left ankle. Her right leg is apparently extended
                                                behind her left. She arches to the right, with her
                                                arms bent at the elbows and her hands clasped
                                                together just below her neck in a gesture that
                                                suggests prayer or supplication. She faces down and
                                                apparently looks at the self-enclosed male below
                                                her. Her long hair drifts behind her neck and back.
                                                She is very probably Oothoon, pleading to her lover.
                                                Right and left of the wave in which she appears is a
                                                rocky cliff. Wavy lines along the lower margin of
                                                the design below both figures suggest small waves of
                                                the sea. Far right is the sea, showing a few
                                                indications of waves. Slightly less than half the
                                                sun can be seen rising-or more probably
                                                sinking-below the sea. The sky above is colored by
                                                its radiance.</illusobjdesc>

                                                three tails in his left hand. His left upper arm is
                                                raised vertically, with his forearm bent to the left
                                                over his head. His right arm is raised and arches
                                                over his head; he points to his forehead with his
                                                right hand. His left leg is extended, his right bent
                                                at the knee. His facial features suggest despair. To
                                                the right is a female nude. She strides, legs spread
                                                apart, forward and to the right. Her arms are bent,
                                                with her hands clutching her face and head. She is
                                                facing down and we see only the top of her head. Her
                                                long hair trails over her right shoulder. She too
                                                may be supported by the cloud or rocky(?) landscape
                                                on which the male sits, although perhaps we are
                                                meant to think of her as hovering in the air. The
                                                female is very probably Oothoon; the male may be
                                                Bromion, in his character as a slave owner, about to
                                                strike the woman. Alternatively, he may be
                                                Theotormon as a self-flagellant. No such scene is
                                                described in the text.</illusobjdesc>

                                        <illusobjdesc>Four (possibly five) gowned, female figures
                                                huddle together in contracted postures. The figure
                                                on the right squats with knees drawn up toward her
                                                chest; her head leans forward onto her knees and we
                                                see only the top of her head. Her hair may be curly.
                                                The figure in the center foreground faces to the
                                                right, with her knees drawn up and her upper body
                                                leaning forward. Her right knee and lower leg cover
                                                her face; we see only her head and long hair. Above
                                                this central figure and slightly behind are the
                                                shoulders and face of a woman with long hair (spread
                                                out on both sides of her head) and a desperate
                                                expression on her face. The left-most figure lies in
                                                a huddled and contracted posture and faces left. Her
                                                upper body is bent over her legs in a severely
                                                contracted posture. Her head is on the far right,
                                                bent low over her extended arm. Above this figure is
                                                an indeterminate cluster of wavy lines that may be
                                                the curly hair of a fifth female. These females are
                                                probably the Daughters of Albion. There is a hint of
                                                a sunrise or sunset in the sky at left and a
                                                particularly dark area of sky to the right of the

                                                back her [Oothoon's] sighs." Three gowned female
                                                figures—the Daughters of Albion—huddle together on
                                                the seashore, lower right. The right-most figure in
                                                the group has her legs drawn up in a sitting or
                                                squatting position similar to her companions. She
                                                looks up and to the left at the figure hovering
                                                above. Her companion to the left also looks up and
                                                to the left. Both legs are drawn up; her right arm
                                                is extended horizontally to the right, with her
                                                right hand resting on her companion's left shoulder.
                                                The left-most figure in the group has both legs
                                                drawn up and her head lowered; we see only the top
                                                of her head. All three females have long hair. Above
                                                the group and to the left is Oothoon, hovering in
                                                the air or on a cloud. We see only her unclothed
                                                chest, head facing forward, long hair streaming out
                                                on both sides of her head, and long arms extended
                                                horizontally. Her mouth is open and her hands seem
                                                to rest on or hold the cloud. Flames emanate from
                                                just below her chest and extend over both arms. The
                                                sea, lower left, includes some waves. A dark cloud,
                                                perhaps of smoke, ascends from a smokestack-like
                                                structure at left, which itself seems to rise from
                                                the sea. The rose coloring of the central cloud and
                                                the yellow of the background sky may indicate sunset
                                                or sunrise.</illusobjdesc>
