            <updatestmt>
                The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of seventeen pen and ink drawings by Blake. Ranging chronologically from his apprenticeship as an engraver to the final decade of his life, this group offers a comprehensive overview of his work in the medium. Most were created when Blake was learning his craft as an artist and reveal his exploration of various themes and genres. His apprentice drawings for James Basire (<hi rend="i">The Body of Edward I and Countess Aveline</hi>) show his early engagement with medieval art. Another group (two drawings titled <hi rend="i">Figures from a Greek Vase</hi> and <hi rend="i">Charon</hi>) is clearly based on classical art or mythology, responses to which were central to British art and design in the second half of the eighteenth century. The cluster of related sketches on two leaves, each titled <hi rend="i">Four Composition Sketches</hi>, is the earliest extant example of Blake’s attempt to construct a pictorial narrative through a series of images. In these, he began to develop his own version of the sublime, an aesthetic more fully represented by the texts and designs in the illuminated books of the 1790s. Several works from the 1780s show the influence of neoclassicism and take their subjects from two fields of lasting interest to Blake: British history (<hi rend="i">King Alfred</hi>, <hi rend="i">A Woman Enthroned</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Procession of Monks</hi>) and the Bible (<hi rend="i">Saul and David</hi>, <hi rend="i">Goliath Cursing David</hi>, and two versions of <hi rend="i">The Good Farmer</hi>). The three much later drawings are exceptions to Blake’s customary procedures and subjects: a landscape <hi rend="i">Garden Path</hi>, <hi rend="i">The Prophet Isaiah</hi> drawn on a woodblock for a wood engraving never executed, and <hi rend="i">Lady Torrens</hi>, a copy of a family portrait by his friend and patron John Linnell.<lb/>
                <lb/>
                Blake did not execute a large number of pen and ink drawings. This is a bit surprising, given the compatibility between the linearity of the medium and his insistence on “the distinct, sharp, and wirey ... bounding line” as the “great and golden rule of art” (Blake’s <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi>). He did, however, make extensive use of pen and ink work to outline forms in his water colors, color prints, and hand tinted relief etchings in the illuminated books. For preliminary sketching, Blake favored pencil over pen and ink, probably because of the lower cost of pencil and the ease of erasure and correction it offered. The Archive will publish his pencil sketches decade by decade, beginning with the earliest works, 1779 through 1790.<lb/>
                <lb/>
                This is the first time that works from the Society of Antiquaries, London have been represented in the Archive. Accordingly, we are also publishing the Society's Blake collection list, which includes all of its original works by Blake, not just those published in the Archive, and joins the Collection Lists of over thirty other contributing institutions.<lb/>
                <lb/>
                As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees.

                    <illusobjdesc>Six mythological figures, all identifiable by their appearance and attributes, stand or sit in this scene representing the Apotheosis of Bacchus.  The leftmost figure, a nude female, sits or reclines on a length of drapery and turns her head to look right.  The horn of abundance in her right hand and the thyrsus in her left mark her as Ariadne.  The second female figure from the left faces right and wears a gown covered with eyes, identifying her as Iris.  In her left hand she holds ambrosia, which she may offer to the central figure of Bacchus. Directly below Iris stands a male figure, nude other than a hat and bit of drapery over his left shoulder, who raises a vase of wine in his left hand and holds another object, perhaps a wineskin, in his right.  This figure may be a faun.  In the center of the composition facing right but looking left sits a nude male figure crowned with laurels and holding a laurel branch.  The laurels and the lyre on which he sits are both attributes of Bacchus Musagetes.  To the immediate right of Bacchus stands a left-facing female figure wearing a long gown.  With her left hand, she like Iris offers Bacchus ambrosia; this figure may be Hebe.  The rightmost figure in the scene is a nude, bearded male who faces right but looks left.  His tail and the lyre in his left hand identify him as Silenus.  This drawing is a copy of an engraving of a Greek vase painting in D'Hancarville (P. F. Hugues), <hi rend="i">Antiquités etrusques, grecques et romaines, tirées du cabinet de M. Hamilton</hi>, Naples 1766-67, volume 2, plate 68.</illusobjdesc>

The second female figure from the left, visible only from approximately the knees up, faces and leans right. Her curly hair is primarily covered by a hat topped with laurels, and she wears a gown covered with eyes, which identifies her as Iris.  The intricate belt of the gown recalls the swirling volutes of a classical capital.  Her right arm is bent with the hand resting on her hip; in her bent left arm she holds a long, somewhat angular object that may be an offering of ambrosia for the central figure of Bacchus.  Her left leg appears to be bent forward.</illusobjdesc>

Directly below Iris stands a male figure, who is nude with prominent genitals.  He wears a large, pointed hat over short, curly hair and a length of drapery covers his left shoulder. With a bent, raised left arm, he carries a jug (perhaps a krater?) in his left hand and holds another object, perhaps a wineskin, in his right.  His left leg is bent at the knee and his right is extended backwards, suggesting he may be walking to the right, although his head is turned sharply to the left.  This figure may be a faun offering wine to Bacchus.</illusobjdesc>

In the center of the composition, a nude male figure with long, curly hair wearing a crown of laurels sits atop a large lyre.  Facing right but with head turned to the left, he rests his right arm on the instrument (which he may play) and holds a bifurcated laurel branch in his left hand with arm bent upwards.  The laurels and the lyre on which he sits are both attributes of Bacchus Musagetes.  A length of drapery covers his left shoulder and falls below the lyre where the decorated fabric ends in a tassel.</illusobjdesc>

He has short, curly hair, a beard, and wears some sort of leafy crown.  His mouth may be slightly open.  The tail visible on his right side and the lyre that he holds (and may play) his left hand identify him as Silenus.  His body faces the right though he turns his head to the left.  His left arm is extended with palm facing down and nearly touches the head of the female figures below him.  His left arm is bent upwards, already him to finger the strings of the lyre.  Both legs are bent slightly at the knees.</illusobjdesc>
