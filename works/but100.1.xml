                    <illusobjdesc>Three pairs of figures, who appear to wear monastic robes with hoods and thus are likely monks, stand or walk to the left toward a group of three standing figures who face right.  The closer monk in the two rightmost pairs each holds a rectangular object, perhaps a book, by his left side.  The leftmost monk who leads the procession appears to extend a similar object toward the foregrounded figure at left, who extends an arm perhaps to receive it.  Like the monks, this figure may wear a gown, though not a hood, and long, perhaps curly, hair is visible, suggesting this figure is female.  This figure may hold something in her(?) right hand.  The second figure immediately behind and to the right of this figure also extends her(?) left arm.  The leftmost figure in the trio appears gowned; she(?) may already holds a similar rectangular object or book by her right side.</illusobjdesc>
