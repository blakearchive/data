    The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of thirty-three of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible.  All take their subjects from the New Testament and have been added to the twenty Old Testament subjects published in March 2010 as “Illustrations to the Bible, c. 1780-1824,” under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.  This new group is presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).
                <lb/><lb/>
                   Blake executed most of these New Testament water colors c. 1800-05 for his patron Thomas Butts.  The exceptions are <hi rend="i">The Whore of Babylon</hi> of 1809 and <hi rend="i">The Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins</hi> in the Yale Center for British Art, datable to c. 1825. The subjects range from the childhood of Jesus to his ascension, the later history of his parents and one of his major followers, St. Paul, and a group of eight designs based on the Book of Revelation.  While the illustrations of the life of Christ are fairly conventional in their subjects, in part because of the long tradition of picturing almost every event in the Gospels, individual motifs recall designs in Blake’s illuminated books and thus offer a window on Blake’s visual interpretation of the Bible. The illustrations of Revelation complement Blake’s intense engagement with apocalyptic events and images in his own poetry.
                    <lb/><lb/>
                        The selection of fifty-three biblical water colors now available in the Archive will be supplemented in the future with early works, such as <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>, datable to c. 1780, and will continue through Blake’s final biblical water colors, such as <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi>. 
                    <lb/><lb/>

In the center of the design, Jesus hovers in mid-air. He has long, curly hair and a beard and wears a gown. His arms are bent upward slightly, with his palms vertical and facing out toward the viewer. An aura or radiance emanates from him. He may be smiling slightly. The hem of his gown is elaborately spread. To the left of Jesus kneels a gowned old man with hair standing on end and a long beard. He is probably either Moses or Elias (see Luke 9:30). He faces right and looks up at Jesus. He bends forward slightly and bends his arms upward, palms together, as if in prayer or supplication. To the right of the leftmost kneeling figure may be a cloud. To the right of Jesus kneels a gowned male with hair on end and a long, curly beard. He is probably either Moses or Elias (see Luke 9:30). He faces left and looks up at Jesus. He bends forward and bends his arms upward, palms together, as if in prayer or supplication. To the left (and possibly to the right) of the rightmost kneeling figure may be flames. In the background to either side of Jesus stands or hovers the ghostly image of a gowned and winged male angel. The angel to the left of Jesus faces forward and appears to be old. He has long hair and a beard, and his hair is standing on end. His mouth is partly open. The angel to the right of Jesus appears to be old and has long hair, standing on end, and a beard. He faces forward and his mouth may be slightly open. In the foreground lie three male figures; these are probably the disciples Peter, John and James (see Luke 9:28). All three wear loose gowns or cloaks. The leftmost figure of this group appears to be an old male with long hair and a beard. He leans on his bent right arm and his body faces forward and down, but his head looks up and to the right, probably at Jesus. The middle figure of this group is prone, facing forward and down. He has short, curly hair and rests his head on his bent left arm, which is on the ground. He may be sleeping (see Luke 9:32). The rightmost figure of this group appears to be an old male with long hair and a beard. His body faces down and to the right, but he looks up and to the left, probably at Jesus. His mouth is open. He bends his right arm upward and his right hand clutches a piece of cloth, perhaps his own gown or cloak.
