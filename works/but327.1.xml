Christ stands at the center of the composition with his arms outstretched and palms out, exposing the stigmata in his hands.  He strides forward with his left foot.  His head is bent to the right with eyes turned downward.  Halo-like radiance surrounds his head and upper body.  Three figures bow to the right of Christ.  In the foreground, a gowned, bearded disciple prostrates himself with his face, lower left arm, and left palm pressed to the ground.  Behind the front-most figure kneels and bows a young disciple with short, curly hair, arm bent upward, and palms probably together as if in prayer.  The third figure from the front bends forward with his head down.  His hair may be curly.  Three figures kneel to the left of Christ.  The front-most figure, a partly nude male with short, curly hair, kneels and sits upright as he looks upward towards Christ.  His arms are bent upward, and his hands are together as if in prayer.  The next figure from the front bows deeply.  His right shoulder and right knee are visible below and to the right of the front-most figure's hands and right leg; his face is not visible but his bent arms and hands, together in prayer, are clearly represented.  Only the head and gowned back of the third figure from the front are pictured.  The background is not defined, but is dark, upper left and right.  The narrow strip of ground below the figures might contain low-growing vegetation.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>Christ</characteristic><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>partly nude</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>striding</characteristic><characteristic>left foot</characteristic><characteristic>palms out</characteristic><characteristic>fingers spread</characteristic><characteristic>arms raised at 45 degrees</characteristic><characteristic>eyes down</characteristic><characteristic>halo</characteristic><characteristic>stigmata</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>mouth open</characteristic><characteristic>speaking</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The risen Christ stands at the center of the composition surrounded by worshiping disciples.  He strides forward with his prominent left foot.  Christ's arms are extended outward from his sides at 45 degrees, with palms out and fingers spread, revealing the stigmata on his palms.  His gown is draped over his right shoulder, leaving the left side of his breast uncovered.  His head is bent to his left and his eyes are lowered, perhaps to look at his disciples.  His hair is long and he wears a short beard.  A halo-like radiant glow surrounds his head and upper body.  His mouth may be slightly open; he may be speaking.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="D"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>disciple</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>short hair</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>palm down</characteristic><characteristic>kneeling</characteristic><characteristic>bowing</characteristic><characteristic>praying</characteristic><characteristic>bending forward</characteristic><characteristic>hand on ground</characteristic><characteristic>facing down</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>prone</characteristic><characteristic>hunched over</characteristic><characteristic>head down</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Three disciples kneel to the right of Christ.

His face is pressed to the ground, as is his left palm; his left arm is bent upward at the elbow and rests on the ground.  His posture suggests prayer.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="D"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>young</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>disciple</characteristic><characteristic>short hair</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>hands together</characteristic><characteristic>bending forward</characteristic><characteristic>kneeling</characteristic><characteristic>bowing</characteristic><characteristic>praying</characteristic><characteristic>hunched over</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>facing down</characteristic><characteristic>looking down</characteristic><characteristic>hands on face</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Three disciples kneel to the right of Christ.

He is very probably bent over in a deep bow, head down, like several other disciples.  His arms are bent upward at the elbow and raised, apparently obscuring his face.  His hands, fingers slightly spread, are together in prayer.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="C"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>disciple</characteristic><characteristic>kneeling</characteristic><characteristic>head down</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>bending forward</characteristic><characteristic>bowing</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>hunched over</characteristic><characteristic>praying</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Three disciples kneel to the left of Christ.
