                <illustration location="E" type="plate">
                    <illusobjdesc>The design is based on Revelation 12:1-4. Dominating the design is the Great Red Dragon seen from behind, a lizard/human hybrid. It is clearly nude and muscular. It has large, outspread bat-like wings, a lizard-like tail with visible vertebrae at its base, and human-like legs; the left leg is on tiptoe and both knees are bent slightly. The tail curls around the legs of the woman at the bottom of the design, as though it is holding her. The angle of the wings suggest that its arms are raised at roughly 135 degrees. The dragon also has three heads. The leftmost head faces away, left, and down and has short, perhaps curly hair. The center head has two looping, bull-like horns and is otherwise bald; it faces away. The rightmost head faces away, right, and down and has short, perhaps slightly curly hair. Each head wears a spiky crown. Behind the heads of the Great Red Dragon is a burst of flames, perhaps suggesting that the dragon is breathing fire. The scene is otherwise set against a dark night sky. Eight six-pointed stars and a crescent moon are visible in the bottom half of the design, including one on the Dragon's tail and three in the woman's hair. Each of the Dragon's feet is placed in a star-like, dark blue shape that might represent water. The gray wash just above the lower margin of the design might represent either the earth or the ocean. At the bottom of the design floats or lies a gowned woman with long, curly, flame-like hair. Her body is twisted so that her bottom half faces forward and her top half faces up. Her legs are together and both feet are visible, beneath the hem of her gown, resting on the crescent moon. Her right leg is bent. She looks up with her mouth open in an expression of fear. Her arms are raised vertically with her arms bent so that her hands are held together, perhaps in a gesture of supplication. The three stars in her hair suggest a crown.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>Dominating the design is the Great Red Dragon seen from behind, a lizard/human hybrid. It is clearly nude and muscular. It has large, outspread bat-like wings, a lizard-like tail with visible vertebrae at its base, and human-like legs; the left leg is on tiptoe and both knees are bent slightly. The tail curls around the legs of the woman at the bottom of the design, as though it is holding her; there is a star on its tail as well. The angle of the wings suggest that its arms are raised at roughly 135 degrees. The dragon also has three heads. The leftmost head faces away, left, and down and has short, perhaps curly hair. The center head has two looping, bull-like horns and is otherwise bald; it faces away. The rightmost head faces away, right, and down and has short, perhaps slightly curly hair. Each head wears a spiky crown. </illusobjdesc>

Her right leg is bent. She looks up with her mouth open in an expression of fear. Her arms are raised vertically with her arms bent so that her hands are held together, perhaps in a gesture of supplication. The three stars in her hair suggest a crown.</illusobjdesc>
