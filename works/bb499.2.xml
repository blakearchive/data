                        commercial colorists, perhaps working as a team. The consistency in coloring
                        among copies indicates that the colorists were following a master copy as
                        their model.</role></origination>

                    <p>The only part of this engraved title page executed by Blake is the vignette
                        of sailing ships, its framing motifs, the inscription on the long, narrow
                        flag in the frame, and Blake's signature lower left just above the barrel of
                        the canon (see the Supplemental Views). All other lettering on this title
                        page was executed by an anonymous writing engraver. This impression is in
                        the second state; the second state of the vignette engraved by Blake also
                        appears on the title page in volume 2 of both the Essick and Huntington
                        copies. A proof of the engraved vignette signed by Blake, with the
                        inscription on the framing flag but before all other letters, is in the
                        collection of the E. J. Pratt Library, Victoria University, Toronto, call
                        no. Blake Suppl. no. 566. For full descriptions, see Robert N. Essick,

                        in Bentley because Blake's signature on the title page vignette was not
                        discovered until 2014.</p>

                        anchor pictured lower right, a long, narrow flag bearing the inscription
                        "cuncta mea mecum" ("my all is with me") attached to a flagpole on the
                        right, another flag attached to a flagpole, another part of the rope, and
                        the lower part of the anchor. The flags on the sterns of the ships and the
                        flags in the frame are colored according to the Dutch flag.</illusobjdesc>

                                    left, these are the barrel of a canon just below Blake's
                                    signature, a rope attached to a circular (iron?) ring, the upper
                                    (wooden?) arm of the anchor pictured lower right, a long, narrow
                                    flag bearing the inscription "cuncta mea mecum" ("my all is with
                                    me") attached to a flagpole on the right, another flag attached
                                    to a flagpole, another part of the rope, and the lower part of
                                    the anchor. The Latin inscription is the family motto of J. G.
                                    Stedman, the author of the book. Both flags are colored
                                    according to the Dutch flag.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>An male Negro ranger (as John Stedman names rebel slave soldiers)
                        stands in the foreground resting a rifle upon his left shoulder, while
                        smoking from a pipe he holds in his right hand. He wears military attire
                        that identifies him as a rebel slave. He wears breeches and a cap. A small
                        branch with leaves adorns the right side of the cap. Two bags (or a bag and
                        a gourd or bottle) are strapped across his bare chest and fall to the left.
                        A sheathed sword that is belted across his chest dangles to the right. Two
                        additional Rangers appear in the far right distance in similar military
                        fashion and also hold rifles. The foreground beneath the prominent figure's
                        bare feet indicates grass, perhaps a larger plant lower left, and a branch
                        with four leaves. A stand of leafy trees and two palm trees appear lower
                        left; two further trees, perhaps palms, grow on the horizon seen between the
                        foreground figure's legs.</illusobjdesc>

                            slave soldiers) stands in the foreground resting a rifle upon his left
                            shoulder. He smokes from a pipe he holds in his right hand. There is a
                            puff of tobacco smoke rising from the bowl of his pipe. Both arms are
                            bent upwards. He faces forward and towards the viewer. Both cheeks have
                            three parallel lines, which may be paint or scars. He wears military
                            attire that identifies him as a rebel slave. His cap has a small branch
                            with leaves tucked within its flap on the right. The cap is inscribed
                            with the number "300." Short curly hair protrudes from the sides of his
                            cap. He wears breeches, with tied bows at the knees. Two bags, or a bag
                            and a gourd or bottle, are strapped across his bare chest and rest on
                            his right hip. The straps or belts may be made of rope. A sheathed sword
                            is strapped across his bare chest and rests on his left hip. He stands
                            with his left leg slightly before his right leg. His feet are prominent.

                            eyes are raised. His right leg is extended behind his left leg.

                            Stedman distinguishes two species of monkeys by describing the Mecoo
                            monkey as having "a black head" and a "very long tail," whereas the
                            Kishee-Kishee monkey has a "milk white face with a black patch in the
                            middle" and a tail that is "black at the extremity." By using Stedman's
                            identifiers, it seems likely that the two monkeys occupying the top
                            section of the large tree are Mecoo monkeys and that the three monkeys
                            occupying the bottom section of the illustration are Kishee Kishee
                            monkeys. The uppermost Mecoo monkey sits slightly upright, although
                            hunched forward. It looks directly at the viewer. Its feet grip the
                            branch to support it as its tail wraps around a branch to anchor its
                            body. Its right paw rests upon its right knee, while its left paw is
                            near its face. The second Mecoo monkey is below and slightly to the
                            right of the sitting monkey in the treetop. The second monkey faces to
                            the left, while holding onto the branch with all of its paws. Both Mecoo
                            monkeys have furry bodies with long tails and appear to be looking
                            toward the viewer. Darker fur circumscribes their faces. In the middle
                            of the illustration, an adult Kishee Kishee monkey clings to a vine
                            dangling from the large tree. All four paws grip the vine as it faces to
                            the right. On the back of this Kishee Kishee monkey is a baby Kishee
                            monkey, which clings with its entire body and wraps its tail around the
                            adult monkey. The baby looks to the right, while slightly towards the
                            viewer. A third Kishee Kishee monkey leaps from the larger tree towards
                            the smaller tree. As it leaps the front paws are extended slightly
                            forward, while its back legs are fully extended back along with its
                            tail.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>John Stedman stands in the lower left corner with his back turned
                        towards the viewer as he points upward towards the Aboma snake. He holds his
                        sheathed(?) sword with his lowered left hand. His gun with bayonet leans
                        against the central, leafy tree. The Aboma snake hangs from a branch in the
                        tree through a noose, while two naked male slaves pull on the rope on the
                        ground (middle distance). A third, naked male slave clings around the
                        snake's upper body as he cuts it with a knife. The foreground appears to be
                        covered in grass. A barren branch rests upon the ground (lower left corner).
                        In the middle distance, there is a thicket, possibly including trees, along
                        the edge of the river. Two pine(?) trees appear above the thicket in the far
                        distance (left margin). A boat floats nearby in the river. The boat includes
                        a rower, a single oar, and a tent-like structure.</illusobjdesc>

                            wearing a wide-brimmed hat, shirt, and pants. There is a diagonal strap
                            (belt?) across his chest from which the sword (possibly sheathed) at his
                            left side may be hanging. He holds the sword or its sheath with his left
                            hand. His legs are slightly spread apart. His left arm is at his side
                            and grips a sheathed sword. His feet are bare. </illusobjdesc>

                            his chest. He has curly hair and has his mouth open, as though speaking
                            to his fellow Marines. A look of concern is on his face. His right arm
                            is raised at 135 degrees and he points up and to the left. His left arm
                            is bent and held at his side; in his left hand and over his left

                            eighteen years of age, covered in her own blood from being whipped with
                            200 lashes. The woman hangs from a tree branch by her wrists, which are
                            tied together. A few strips of torn cloth cover her genitals, but she is
                            otherwise nude. Her head is hung backward with her mouth open and her
                            eyes looking upward. Her left leg is bent and her right leg is on
                            tiptoe, trying to reach the ground. Above her right knee hang strips,
                            perhaps of her own flesh, or dripping blood. There are a number of
                            horizontal bloody wounds visible on her skin and there are patches of
                            blood on the strip of cloth. </illusobjdesc>

                            plate. The leftmost monkey hangs upside down by its tail from a branch.
                            Its legs are all bent and it holds a stick in its front right paw. Its
                            head faces the viewer. The rightmost monkey of this pair hangs from both
                            its left arm and leg, as well as its looped tail, from branches of the
                            tree. Its left arm and leg are both bent. It faces up and looks forward
                            toward the viewer. Stedman describes the Quato monkey as very large,
                            having a long tail and thin arms and legs, and covered with black hair,
                            despite its red face.</illusobjdesc>

                            looks forward toward the viewer. Both have bent legs and arms and raise
                            their tails. Stedman describes the Saccawinkee monkey as the smallest
                            monkey in Guiana, with long hair, a white face, long whiskers, and a

                            suggesting that she is walking. What is visible of her hair appears to
                            be short and curly. Her left arm is raised at 45 degrees, and in her
                            left hand she holds a tray with a half-full glass on it. Her right arm
                            is raised almost horizontally, and in her right hand she holds a
                            decanter. She casts a shadow on the ground to the right.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Stedman describes this family of slaves as "in that State of
                        Tranquil Happiness to Which they are all entitled When they are Well treated
                        by their Owners." The largest figure on the plate is that of a nearly nude
                        male, clothed only by a small loincloth, and identified by Stedman as of the
                        Loango nation by the marks on his body. The man carries a large fish on a
                        string in his right hand. His left arm balances a basket of smaller fish and
                        eels on his head. A female slave clothed in a skirt walks to the right of
                        him. She carries an infant in a sling on her back and a large basket of
                        fruit on her head. She smokes a pipe and is spinning cotton thread with her
                        hands. A nude male child clings to her skirts. In the left background, two
                        small figures are pictured near the shore of a lake or river. A hill rises
                        on the right. </illusobjdesc>

                            wearing just a small loincloth secured by a string around his waist. He
                            has eight groupings of five dots, which Stedman tells us marks him as of
                            the Loango nation. He is also branded or scarred by the letters J.G.S.
                            (Stedman's initials) on his upper right chest. His left leg is extended
                            back and on tiptoe, suggesting that he may be walking. He faces forward
                            and to the right. His right arm is at his side and he carries a large
                            fish on a string in his right hand. His left arm is raised nearly
                            vertically and balances a straw basket of fish (including eels) on his
                            head, set atop a fishnet. He has short, curly hair and casts a shadow to
                            the right on the ground.</illusobjdesc>

                            Both figures appear to have short hair.</illusobjdesc>
