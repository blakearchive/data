                <compdate value="1791.A">1791<note>Willey Reveley's letter to Blake is dated "Oct
                        18" in Reveley's hand, but the partial postmark stamp, "C OCT / 7", suggests
                        it may have actually been posted by [1]7 October 1791. Bentley (<hi rend="i"
                            >Writings</hi> volume 2, page 1521) notes "The date of the letter is in
                        some doubt [...] for though Reveley clearly dated the letter 'Oct 18', the
                        numeral in the postmark is equally clearly a '7'. I cannot reconcile these
                        facts." Blake's undated reply to Reveley was written on the back of the
                        letter he received by post from Reveley. According to Essick (<hi rend="i"
                            >Huntington</hi>, page 185), "Blake refers to his willingness to engrave
                        for Reveley 'by the end of January' some illustrations for James Stuart and
                        Nicholas Revett, <hi rend="i">The Antiquities of Athens</hi>. Volume 3
                        (1794) of that work (see Part III, section B, No. 48) includes 4 plates by
                        Blake dated 3 April 1792 in the imprints. Thus, Blake must have written his
                        note, a direct reply to Reveley's letter, shortly after 18 October 1791."

                        missing. Blake's undated reply to Reveley, probably a draft, is written on

                        Reveley; see note on Composition Date, above. Reveley's letter to Blake and
