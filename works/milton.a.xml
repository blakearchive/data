   The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of the electronic edition of <hi rend="i">Milton a Poem</hi> Copy A. There are only four copies of <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>, Blake's most personal epic. Copy A, from the British Museum, joins Copy C, from the New York Public Library, previously published in the Archive and now republished with corrected transcriptions.<lb/><lb/>
   Blake etched forty-five plates for <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> in relief, with some full-page designs in white-line etching, between c. 1804 (the date on the title page) and c. 1811. Six additional plates (a-f) were probably etched in subsequent years up to 1818. No copy contains all fifty-one plates. The prose "Preface" (Plate 2) appears only in Copies A and B. Plates a-e appear only in Copies C and D, plate f only in Copy D. The first printing, late in 1810 or early in 1811, produced Copies A-C, printed in black ink and finished in water colors. Blake retained Copy C and added new plates and rearranged others at least twice; Copy C was not finished until c. 1821. Copy D was printed in 1818 in orange ink and elaborately colored. The Archive will publish electronic editions of Copies B and D in the near future.<lb/><lb/>
   Like all the illuminated books in the Archive, the text and images of <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> Copy A are fully searchable and are supported by our Inote and ImageSizer applications. With the Archive's Compare feature, users can easily juxtapose multiple impressions of any plate across the different copies of this or any of the other illuminated books. New protocols for transcription, which produce improved accuracy and fuller documentation in editors' notes, have been applied to all copies of <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> in the Archive.<lb/><lb/>
   With the publication of <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> Copy A, the Archive now contains fully searchable and scalable electronic editions of sixty-two copies of Blake's nineteen illuminated books in the context of full bibliographic information about each work, careful diplomatic transcriptions of all texts, detailed descriptions of all images, and extensive bibliographies. In addition to illuminated books, the Archive contains many important manuscripts and series of engravings, sketches, and water color drawings, including Blake's illustrations to Thomas Gray's <hi rend="i">Poems</hi>, water color and engraved illustrations to Dante's <hi rend="i">Divine Comedy</hi>, the large color printed drawings of 1795 and c. 1805, the Linnell and Butts sets of the Book of Job water colors and the sketchbook containing drawings for the engraved illustrations to the <hi rend="i">Book of Job</hi>, the water color illustrations to Robert Blair's <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, and the water color illustrations to John Milton's <hi rend="i">Paradise Regained</hi>, <hi rend="i">L'Allegro</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Il Penseroso</hi>, as well as the Butts and Thomas sets of illustrations to Milton's <hi rend="i">Comus</hi>, <hi rend="i">Nativity</hi> ode, and <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi>.<lb/><lb/>
   As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the continuing support of the Library of Congress, and the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.

at least nine human figures.  The two largest hover in the lower
right and left sections of the image.  Both are nude; the figure on
the left is probably male.  We see him from behind, but his face appears to be turned to the left.  His arms are raised vertically and his right
leg is extended to the right, nearly touching the
right foot of his companion (probably female).  His left leg is
drawn up toward his torso.  Vague indications of vegetative forms
appear—or perhaps even grow from—his head.  The grain tassels
below him suggest that he is a personification of grain.  His
female companion on the right has her right leg extended (only a
sliver of her left leg is pictured) so that her right foot nearly touches
the male's right foot.  Her body is twisted and bent sharply at the
waist; she faces to the left.  Her arms are raised over her head;
between them are some confused forms that may be a bunch of grapes. 
Thus, while her male companion may personify grain, she may
personify grapes or wine.  Other vegetative forms appear below her. 
A plant grows from the point, lower center, between the feet of these two major figures.  The top right corner of the composition
is dominated by a large star or comet; its lines of radiance or
beams of light extend all the way to the left margin.  Seven small
figures decorate the letters of the heading.  A figure—difficult to make out in this copy—rests, at a
45 degree angle, against the first vertical of "M"; another figure,
perhaps gowned, sits in a contracted posture against the final
vertical of the letter.  He or she faces to the right.  A figure
stands rigidly, facing forward, on the lower loop of "L" in
"MILTON."  The top horizontal of the "T" bears a seated and probably
gowned figure, facing to the right and with legs bent but extended
in the same direction.  In the "O" of "MILTON," a small figure,
perhaps a child, strides to the right with arms raised vertically. 
This figure holds a string in his or her left hand, attached at its
upper end to a bird in flight.  A larger figure, probably an adult,
leans against the right side of the "O" and looks to the left,
toward the child.  A very small figure, probably facing
left, leans against the vertical of the "F" in the word "First."  Two birds fly on
extended wings above the "B" of "Book"; a large bird flies to the
left just below the final letter of "MILTON" (to the left of the
face of the large nude female).  Blue, yellow, and rose coloring in the background of the design may represent the sky at sunrise or sunset.  The dark coloring
at the top and along the right margin suggests that the scene
unfolds in a cave or among the trunks of large trees (the vertical

On
the right is a figure standing on a (stone?) plinth.  His legs are
spread apart and both arms raised at approximately 45 degrees. 
Both hands are clenched into fists.  His muscular body is twisted,
with his head bent sharply to the left.  His mouth is open slightly
and his face expresses anger, perhaps mixed with fear.  He faces
forward, but his head is bent to the left and his eyes seem to be
turned up and to the left.  He is surrounded by flames, the shape
of which is imitated by his hair.  On the left, the front-most
figure, seen from behind, is standing with legs together.  His face
is seen in profile turned to the right; he appears to be looking at
the man in flames.  His hair is curly.  His one visible arm (the
right) is bent at the elbow and he holds his hands together,
perhaps in prayer.  His face suggests a combination of meekness, pity, and surprise.  His
body is very muscular.  Behind this figure we see the head, legs,
and upper right body of another standing nude male, facing forward. 
He has long hair, with his head twisted to the right (he is
probably looking at the man in flames).  His face also suggests
surprise or pity.  His legs are spread apart.  His left foot is
raised on to the plinth and touches the right foot of the man in
flames.  His left arm is bent before his body, with the fingers of
that hand spread apart (his right hand is not clearly pictured).  These three figures have been variously
identified; our best guess is that Rintrah (a representative of
wrath) is the figure on the plinth, Satan stands in the left
foreground (associated with false pity and with Blake's patron,
William Hayley, in the poem's autobiographical allegory), and
Palamabron (a milder counterpart of Rintrah) stands in the left

the portrayal of the Cain and Abel story on Plate 12.  The
characters and thematic implications, however, are very different. 
On the left, a nude male arches or falls backward with his head
bent back and his arms extended horizontally.  His legs are spread
apart, with the right leg bent at the knee.  His hands are raised
horizontally, palms up.  This posture suggests crucifixion or a
moment of ecstasy, religious and/or erotic.  A comet or falling
star trailing lines of radiance descends into the man's left foot. 
The very close similarities between this figure and the man on
Plate 29 indicate that this too is William Blake with Milton (the
comet) descending into his tarsus (see the text on this plate,
lines 48-51).  The gowned female standing on the right may be Blake's
wife, Catherine, turning away from the dramatic events on the left
(which she may mistake for death rather than revelation).  Her
lower body apparently faces forward, but her upper body and head
are twisted to the right.  Her head is bent down into her hands. 
Her arms are bent at the elbows.  Between the two figures is an
altar of stones with vines or roots growing over it, much like the
altar on Plate 12.

youthful and muscular nude male, seen from behind.  He has short
hair and is striding away from us, bent left leg forward and right
leg extended behind.  His right foot and its tarsus are prominent
as it breaks the word "Self- -hood" in the brief text below.  His
arms are raised vertically and reach forward (in
relation to his body) to grasp the head of an old, gowned figure
behind him and facing us.  The young man is Milton in the act of
both wrestling with and sculpting the ancient form of Urizen, as
described on Plate 17 in this copy.  Urizen's face,
twisted to the right, expresses grief; his eyes may be looking
upward.  He has a long beard and long hair.  His legs are spread
apart, with the right leg plunged into the River Arnon that runs
horizontally between the two figures.  His left leg is bent at the
knee, with the lower leg extended to the right.  Urizen's arms are
raised horizontally, with each hand, palms down, resting on the top
of a rectangular stone pillar.  These may be tombstones or the
tablets of the decalogue; each bears Hebrew letters on its forward
side.  They are tilted, as though about to fall to each side. 
Behind Urizen is a hill on which a group of five figures stands. 
All play musical instruments: from left to right, a horn or
trumpet, a tambourine, a harp, a horn with one loop in it, and
another tambourine.  The two gowned females on the left in this
group may be walking to the left.  Both have their arms raised. 
The woman nearest the left margin has her head back with her horn
to her mouth; the next woman to the right has long hair; her head
is twisted so that she faces forward.  The central figure is a
curly-haired male, facing forward in a contrapposto stance.  He is
probably wearing tights.  The next figure to the right is another
gowned female, perhaps walking to the left.  To her right and
slightly behind her is yet another gowned woman with her arms and
tambourine raised above her head.  These figures have been
interpreted as personifications of the liberated senses, but they
might be the "sons &amp; daughters" of Rahab and Tirzah who "In all
their beauty...entice Milton across the river" (Plate 17, lines 31-32).  Beams of
radiant light (a sunrise or sunset?) emanate from behind the dark

described on Plate 20 of the text.  William Blake, a
muscular nude, kneels on his left leg, with the right leg bent sharply
at the knee.  (In other copies, both Blake and Los also have the outlines of 
loincloths or very short breeches on their bodies.)  The outlines of a sandal appear beneath his right
foot; its straps appear on his upper foot and ankle.  His hair is
slightly curly.  His left arm is at his side, extending to his left
thigh; his right arm is bent upward.  We see the back of his right
hand, fingers spread.  His body faces forward, but his head is
twisted violently up and to the right.  He appears to be looking up
at the standing figure behind him.  This is Los, also a muscular
nude.  He faces forward
with legs spread, striding toward us with his right foot within the
disc of the sun behind him and his left foot on the grass-covered
hill or mound on which Blake kneels.  However, if the perspective
is cosmic, this "hill" is the circumference of the earth.  The
passage illustrated makes it clear that the setting is the Vale of
Lambeth.  Los's hair is curly and his arms are bent upward, with
his right hand raised, palm out, and the fingers spread.  The
fingers of his raised left hand are behind his head,
twisted down and to the right.  He is probably looking down toward
Blake.  The relative positions of the two figures have suggested
oral-genital contact to some interpreters.  Flames appear within
the disc of the sun on both sides of Los; flames emanate from the sun's circumference.  The blue wash around the sun may indicate sky in the far background.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="CD"><characteristic>Blake, William</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>muscular</characteristic><characteristic>kneeling</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent at knee</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised</characteristic><characteristic>arm at side</characteristic><characteristic>arm resting</characteristic><characteristic>fingers spread</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing up</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>sandal</characteristic><characteristic>twisted</characteristic><characteristic>erotic</characteristic><illusobjdesc>William Blake, a muscular nude, kneels on his left leg, with

The star or comet trails radiant beams of light behind it.  Blake's body is bent backward dramatically, with his head bent back
farther, as though in ecstasy.  His left leg is bent sharply at the
knee with the right leg forward.  Thus, his legs are spread apart,
perhaps because he is striding to the left (the direction in which
his body faces).  His arms are raised horizontally, with hands
raised, palms out.  This posture suggests crucifixion.  The fingers of both hands are spread apart slightly.  He is nude in this copy, while in others he wears
short tights.  Three (stone?) steps are pictured lower right.  The
dark background suggests that this may be a night scene.  Blake
would appear to be standing on a small strip of grass-covered ground.

shows a door, several windows, two chimneys, and a thatched roof. 
A flock of birds flies above the cottage.  A few vines or plants grow
at the base of the facade of the cottage right of the door.  The
garden in the foreground is mostly grass with paths running through
it.  Trees stand on the right; there may be another tree in the left margin.  The gray area on the bottom on the right may be the sea.  The two figures represent an event
described in line 11 on this plate.  Near the bottom margin
of the plate, William Blake walks to the right.  He apparently
wears tights and may be looking up
at the female figure hovering above and to the right.  This is
Ololon, Milton's emanation.  She is descending into Blake's garden,
arms raised horizontally.  Her gown—or perhaps a separate cloak—

below the brief text is very probably Ololon.  Her legs are together
and her arms raised at 135 degrees.  She holds in her raised hands,
palms up, a cloak or veil.  This gesture suggests that she is
disrobing to reveal her body, which faces forward.  Her hair is
long and flame-like.  Her head is raised slightly and her eyes
appear to be turned upward.  Her posture hints at a crucifixion;
the outline of her form, including the veil, suggests the shape of
a chalice.  On each side of this central female are grain stems
and/or tassels given human (male) forms.  These two have their legs
together and look toward Ololon.  Both have curly hair.  The
individual ears of grain form cloaks around these two figures. 
Spiky lines between the anthropomorphic grain and Ololon suggest

below the brief text is very probably Ololon.  Her legs are together
and her arms raised at 135 degrees.  She holds in her raised hands,
palms up, a cloak or veil.  This gesture suggests that she is
disrobing to reveal her body, which faces forward.  Her hair is
long and flame-like.  Her head is raised slightly and her eyes
appear to be turned upward.  Her posture hints at a crucifixion;
the outline of her form, including the veil, suggests the shape of
a chalice.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="AC"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>young</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>legs together</characteristic><characteristic>grain stem</characteristic><characteristic>grain tassel</characteristic><characteristic>seen from behind</characteristic><characteristic>facing away</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>cloak</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The anthropomorphic form of a grain stem and/or tassel
