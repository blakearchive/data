      <seriesstmt>The William Blake Archive</seriesstmt>
      <updatestmt>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of thirty-three of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible.  All take their subjects from the New Testament and have been added to the twenty Old Testament subjects published in March 2010 as “Illustrations to the Bible, c. 1780-1824,” under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.  This new group is presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).
                
        <lb/>
        <lb/>
        Blake executed most of these New Testament water colors c. 1800-05 for his patron Thomas Butts.  The exceptions are 
        <hi rend="i">The Whore of Babylon</hi>
        of 1809 and 
        <hi rend="i">The Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins</hi>
        in the Yale Center for British Art, datable to c. 1825. The subjects range from the childhood of Jesus to his ascension, the later history of his parents and one of his major followers, St. Paul, and a group of eight designs based on the Book of Revelation.  While the illustrations of the life of Christ are fairly conventional in their subjects, in part because of the long tradition of picturing almost every event in the Gospels, individual motifs recall designs in Blake’s illuminated books and thus offer a window on Blake’s visual interpretation of the Bible. The illustrations of Revelation complement Blake’s intense engagement with apocalyptic events and images in his own poetry.
                    
        <lb/>
        <lb/>
        The selection of fifty-three biblical water colors now available in the Archive will be supplemented in the future with early works, such as 
        <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>
        , datable to c. 1780, and will continue through Blake’s final biblical water colors, such as 
        <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi>
        .

          <illusobjdesc>The design is based in part on 1 Corinthians 15:4, as the inscription on the mount indicates, but some motifs are based on the description of Christ's resurrection in Matthew 28 and 1 Corinthians 15:44. Dominating the center of the design is the hovering figure of Jesus, nude except for a cloth wrapped around his waist and genitals. This is the &quot;spiritual body&quot; of Christ (1 Corinthians 15:44). He has long, curly hair and a beard. His hair is flame-like and stands on end. Jesus emanates an aura or halo with beams of light. His right leg is bent slightly and his arms are raised horizontally, palms vertical and his fingers pointing upward. He faces forward but looks slightly left. To the left of Jesus in the lower foreground are three figures, probably male. These are the guards at Christ's tomb. The leftmost figure faces forward and up to the right. He may have long hair and have his eyes closed. He may wear a gown and be crouching, with his body facing left. The middle figure faces up, with his body facing forward and to the right. He may have long hair and his mouth may be slightly open. His eyes are closed and he may be fainting. He leans on his bent right arm. The rightmost figure is visible only has a head with its mouth open. He faces right, up, and forward, and may have long hair. In the center of the foreground is a male figure with short, curly hair. This is the &quot;natural body&quot; of Christ (1 Corinthians 15:44) he leaves behind at the resurrection. He may be nude, or partly clothed with a cloth (perhaps Christ's shroud) draped over his back. He faces down, prone, with his arms raised horizontally. To the right of Jesus are three more guards at Christ's tomb. The leftmost is male with short, curly hair. His mouth is open and he looks up to the left, while his body faces down and right. His arm is raised horizontally and he holds what may be a shield or a stone tablet with writing (perhaps suggesting Hebrew letters) on it. If the latter, this may be a tablet of the Ten Commandments, the old law that Christ's dispensation replaces. He may be lying on the ground. The middle figure is that of an old man with long hair and a beard. He wears a gown and faces down, right, and forward. His mouth is open. He may be kneeling or falling forward. Only the gowned shoulders and neck of the rightmost figure, facing right and down, are visible, above and slightly to the right of the bearded old man. The scene is dark and appears to appears to take place at night. A stone wall of Christ's tomb with an open arched doorway is visible in the background.
