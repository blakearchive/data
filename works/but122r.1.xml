                <objnote><p>Blake developed this subject and basic composition through a series of seven or eight further drawings, including Butlin 120 recto, 120A recto and verso, 121, 122 verso, 123 recto, 124, and possibly untraced 125, *Christ as the Good Shepherd*.  The pen and ink drawing on the verso of this wash drawing is one of these versions of the same subject and basic design.</p></objnote>

                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>The general theme and subject of this composition were probably influenced by several biblical passages, including Ruth 2:1-17, I Samuel 12:16-19, and Matthew 9:38.  This design depicts a field of grain and, near it, a Christ-like figure surrounded by other figures who seek his aid. This particular drawing differs from others in the set by omitting the buildings found in the left distance (which appear in all other versions), by showing traces of an erased figure at left of the Christ figure, and by replacing the gleaning woman (who appears in the lower righthand corner of some versions) with a small girl. This girl faces left, and she crouches low and strides forward with her right leg, on which a sheaf of grain appears to rest. Alternatively, she may kneel on the ground. Her left leg bends and extends backward; her left arm is raised horizontally, extending forward to grasp another piece of grain. Her right arm may join it. The girl leans forward as she gleans, and her head tilts downward slightly as her eyes close in a solemn or even despairing expression. She has long, curly hair and wears a long-sleeved gown that extends to her ankles. In front of the girl, at the left edge of the grain field, stands the "good farmer," who has been identified with Christ. The farmer has long hair and a beard; he wears a long-sleeved gown that reaches his ankles. The farmer's body faces forward and to the right; his right leg extends forward as if stepping toward the viewer. He extends both arms toward the young girl at right, his palms facing away from him and slightly upward. His mouth may be open. The farmer turns his head to the left and, though his eyes appear to be closed, could be looking back at the group of figures who kneel behind him. Three of these figures face rightward, and one faces away and to the left. They are, from left to right: a man with short, curly hair who is mostly hidden by the other figures, and who looks upward toward the farmer; a long-haired woman who faces right, leans forward, and reaches out with both arms toward the farmer as she gazes up toward him; a small male(?) child who kneels, facing left, and hides his face in the woman's skirt; and a bearded man who kneels, facing right, and lowers his left arm as he gazes upward toward the farmer. Above these figures is the shadow of another, apparently erased, who faces right and reaches toward the farmer's shoulder. Another shadowy figure who may be female appears over the field of grain, just above the gleaning girl. This figure may also have been erased. The figure faces left and bends over, extending both arms downward toward the same sheaf of grain that the young girl grasps. The woman appears to have long hair, and there is slight indication of eyes, a nose, and a mouth. To the right of the farmer, behind the edge of the grain field, stands another male figure who faces right and extends his bent arms across the top of the grain field. His palms face one another, hovering over the grain. He has long hair and a long beard, and his eyes are raised toward the sky. In the upper righthand corner, another field of grain appears in the distance. Curved lines above the field suggest smoke, indicating that the field may be on fire. To the right of the field stand five(?) figures. The two figures at left stand, facing left toward the field, and raising their arms above their heads. The three figures at right may also face the field, or they may turn away from it, facing the design's right border. Two prominent shadows appear in the design, in addition to the faded figures surrounding the main field of grain. One of these appears on the ground at left of the standing Christ figure, behind the young boy. The other appears behind the small girl who gleans in the lower righthand quadrant.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>A small girl stands before a large area of waist-high grain (perhaps wheat or corn). She may be gathering the grain. This girl faces left, and she crouches low and strides forward with her right leg, on which a sheaf of grain appears to rest. Alternatively, she may kneel on the ground. Her left leg bends and extends backward; her left arm is raised horizontally, extending forward to grasp another piece of grain. Her right arm may join it. The girl leans forward as she gleans, and her head tilts downward slightly as her eyes close in a solemn or even despairing expression. She has long, curly hair and wears a long-sleeved gown that extends to her ankles.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>At left of the "good farmer," four figures kneel and appear to be asking for aid. Second from left--and the most prominent figure of the group--is a woman who reaches out with both arms toward the farmer. The woman has long, curly hair, and she wears a short-sleeved gown that gathers in folds around her ankles as she kneels on the ground, facing right. She bends forward at the waist, leaning toward the farmer as she gazes up toward him. Her arms extend outward and upward; her pams face one another, and her fingers are spread. The woman's mouth opens, suggesting an expression of despair, or perhaps that she speaks to the farmer. She may be the mother of the child who hides his face in her skirt.</illusobjdesc>

A small male(?) child kneels, facing left, and hides his face in the woman's skirt. The back of his head is covered with short, dark hair. He is nude from the waist up, and is covered by a skirt or other garment from the waist down. His visible left foot is flexed, and he may sit on his heels. His left arm bends sharply upward, and his fingers are spread. He may clutch the garment of the woman in front of him, perhaps his mother.</illusobjdesc>
