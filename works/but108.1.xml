                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>The design features two male figures, Abraham and Isaac, who kneel facing one another next to an altar. At left, Abraham is an old man with long hair and a long beard. A robe or other garment covers most of his body, except for his bare right shoulder and right arm. The garment extends from Abraham's left arm around his back and drapes over his right leg. Behind Abraham, the drapery appears to float away from his back. Abraham kneels, facing right, with his shoulders hunched forward. His right arm extends downward and slightly to the right, and he points at the ground with his index finger. His left arm wraps around the body of his son Isaac, embracing him in a protective gesture. Abraham's left hand dangles, his index finger pointing toward the ground. Abraham's mouth appears to be open slightly, and he looks straight ahead (toward the right edge of the design) with an expression of grief or despair. The much smaller Isaac figure at right has long hair and appears to wear a robe, gown, or other garment. He faces left toward his father and kneels with legs together and feet flexed. He hunches forward and holds his forearms horizontally, crossing them in front of his body. Isaac's head is down, and he appears to hide in his father's embrace. Isaac's face shows an expression of fear or despair. To the right of Abraham and Isaac, an altar appears, perhaps with wood stacked on top. The shape of the flames and smoke above the altar suggests a human-like figure, perhaps an angel. This figure's head and right arm (and perhaps left arm) are faintly visible. The right arm extends to the left, toward Abraham and Isaac, with fingers spread and the palm facing the viewer, as if reaching toward the pair. In the lower right corner, at the base of the altar, sits a small lamp, perhaps with a flame extending upward from its top. The lower portion of the altar, including the area with the lamp, is shaded. Other significant shadows appear at upper right, over the angel figure; behind Abraham's back and legs; below Isaac's knees; and over Isaac's chest and genitals.</illusobjdesc>
