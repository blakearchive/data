            The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of Blake's illustrations to John Milton's <hi rend="i">Comus</hi>. This group of eight water colors was acquired, and probably commissioned, by Thomas Butts in about 1815. These designs, now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, are presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (our image annotation program).<lb/><lb/>
            Blake had produced a suite of <hi rend="i">Comus</hi> water colors for the Rev. Joseph Thomas in 1801. This earlier group, previously published in the Archive, pictures the same eight subjects as the set presented here. There are, however, many differences between the two suites in motifs and in the portrayals of characters from the poem. The Thomas designs show strong outlines and relatively subdued colors; in contrast, the Butts designs include more interior modeling and an emphasis on complex surfaces created with small brush strokes.<lb/><lb/>
            In his <hi rend="i">Comus</hi> designs, as is usual in his work as an illustrator of other poets' writings, Blake paid close attention to the text, but this disciplined approach did not preclude his own interpretations. For example, Milton ends his masque with joyous dance and song, but Blake ends his illustrations on a more serious note, as indicated by the facial expressions of all six figures. His selection of poetic passages to illustrate reveals, in itself, Blake's emphasis on unusual states of consciousness, including trances and visions.<lb/><lb/>
            With this publication, the Archive contains five of Blake's nine series of water colors illustrating Milton's poetry: both sets of <hi rend="i">Comus</hi> designs, the Thomas set of illustrations to "On the Morning of Christ's Nativity," the illustrations to "L'Allegro" and "Il Penseroso," and the <hi rend="i">Paradise Regained</hi> designs. It is our intention to publish in the near future the remaining four series: three sets illustrating <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi> and the Butts set of designs for "On the Morning of Christ's Nativity."<lb/><lb/>
            As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the continuing support of the Library of Congress, and the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.

                  gambol across the design from mid-upper right to lower left, in a woodland setting.
                  Comus, the male in human form at the right, prances forward with right leg
                  extended, carrying a magician's wand or staff in one of his upraised hands and a
                  cup or goblet in his other hand.  
                  Three of his followers are depicted at full-length, with the head and part of the upper body
                  of a fourth pictured just to the left of the tree trunk on the right.
                  The four followers have each been turned into brutes and have animal heads atop
                  (mostly) human bodies (from left to right, a hog, a dog, an ox or cow, and a bird).  
                  They each bear a torch or large candle.
                  A young woman sits on a rock or bank at the bottom right corner;
                  she turns right and holds her arms bent upward from the elbows, palms out. With her head
                  up and back, she looks up and to the right.
                  She is Milton's "Lady," threatened by Comus.  
                  A tree with prominent roots grows above and to the right of the Lady and leans
                  rightward out of the design, while other trees fill in the background to the left and right
                  of the human-beasts.  The dark sky with stars indicates
                  that this is a night scene.

                     the left but turns his head to look right.  He holds both arms upward, bent
                     at the elbows, and carries a magician's wand or staff in his upraised right
                     hand and a goblet or cup in his left.  He is wearing semi-transparent tights
                     and has shoes or slippers on both feet.  His hair is curly and he appears to
                     be smiling slightly, eyes raised.

                     Three of his followers are depicted at full-length, while the head and upper body
                     of a fourth extends just to the left of the tree trunk on the right.  The followers
                     have each been turned into brutes and have animal heads atop (mostly) human bodies 
                     (from left to right, a hog, a dog, an ox or cow, and a bird).  The leftmost figure, a woman
                     wearing a transparent gown, has the head of a hog.  This figure strides forward or 
                     stands on her left foot, right foot extended extended behind her on tiptoe, and twists
                     her upper body rightward, lifting both arms over her head.  She carries a candle in 
                     her right hand.  Two tusks are visible in her mouth.  The dog-man to the right of her
                     lunges left, with right leg bent forward and bent left leg extended behind him.  He
                     twists away and to the right, as if to look behind him, and lifts both arms vertically;
                     his right palm is held vertically, and his left hand holds a candle.  He is wearing a
                     collar around his neck, and ribbons or bands of cloth attached to the loop on the collar
                     (depicted above his right shoulder) wind around his body, which is otherwise nude.  His
                     open mouth shows at least one sharp tooth.  The third fully-pictured follower is just
                     to the left of Comus.  With upper body facing the viewer, this sexually-ambiguous figure
                     holds both arms bent upward; the right hand holds a candle, and the left is held with
                     palm horizontal above his or her head.  His or her ox's (or cow's) head, complete with horns, is
                     bent slightly to the right.  Bands of fur or cloth extend from the figure's neck in
                     waving folds, covering the torso and hips.  He or she strides leftward with the left
                     leg, right leg extended backward on tiptoe.  The head and part of the upper body of
                     the fourth follower appears to the right of Comus.  This figure appears to lean leftward
                     into the design.  His or her vertically raised right arm holds a candle overhead.
                     The figure's bird head looks left.  Feathers form a spiky crest near the crown of the bird's 
                     head.  The left arm and lower body are not pictured.

                     right.  Her arms are bent at the elbows, and her palms are held vertically, facing right.
                     She wears a long, high-waisted gown and has long curly hair.  Her feet, visible beneath 
                     the hem of her gown, are clad in shoes or slippers.  She is Milton's "Lady," threatened

The four figures seated
                  behind the table, away from the viewer, are some of Comus' enchanted followers; they have
                  the heads of animals (from left to right, an elephant, a lion, a hog just visible to the
                  right of Comus' cloak, and a bird).  Two other followers stand slightly behind them and to 
                  the left, each bearing a pitcher or jar.  The one on the right is a cat.  The
                  one on the left is a wrinkled, bald old man.  The Lady sits before the table at the left 
                  side of the design, in a sturdy chair decorated with the images of grain shafts.  She sits
                  rigidly with her arms resting on her bent legs, palms facing down.  Comus, now shown in
                  his own physically-imposing form, towers above the Lady from his position standing before
                  the table at the right of the design.  With body facing the viewer, Comus holds a goblet
                  in his left hand and extends his right towards the Lady to hold his magiciam's wand or
                  staff over her head.  His position suggests that he is conjuring up the semitransparent snake 
                  rising out of the jar
                  held by the wrinkled old man standing behild the Lady.  The table is set with at least
                  a platter and a large cup or vase.  Overhead hang three large lamps.  A series of arches
                  and columns in the background suggest the classical grandeur of the palace.  The outline
                  of a cloud appears above the heads of the followers on the left.

                     to the left to look toward the Lady.  He wears a long blue cloak or cape and rose-purple
                     semi-transparent tights; his short, curly hair is reddish.

All
                     have the heads, and most have the upper bodies, of animals.  The figure farthest right has a bird's
                     head with a long, pointed beak extending downward from its face and a crest on the top
                     of its head.  Its round eyes stare forward.  This figure has the most human-like hands, with 
                     fingers that grasp either side of a cup or vase on the table in front of it.  Though the figure's elbows
                     and arms seem to be resting on the table, it is difficult to tell how or in what they are clothed.  To
                     the left of this bird-figure, just visible to the right of Comus' cloak, is the snout, eye, and perhaps
                     the left shoulder of a hog-figure.  Facing right, the hog's snout is open, revealing an extended tongue
                     and perhaps a tusk.  Just to the left of Comus sits a lion-figure, facing forward and resting at least 
                     one paw on the table.  This figure has a long curly mane extending downward to cover its chest.  Its
                     mouth is open, showing two canine teeth, and its eyes are round and staring.  To the left of this 
                     lion-figure is an elephant-figure, who is the leftmost of the followers seated at the table.  The
                     elephant looks rightward from its position at the far left corner of the table.  Its trunk extends
                     downward over the table and its mouth is open beneath two curling tusks.  Its right arm is resting
                     on the table, with forearm and hand or paw lying on a platter that sits on the table.

                     and round, staring eyes that are rather like the lion's and the bird's.  This cat-figure is dressed in
                     a long gown or robe, which has embroidery or similar decoration along the collar area and down the front.  The decoration may be grain stems, like those on the Lady's chair.
                     With visible right arm bent and held at its side, it holds a pitcher or jar resting on a platter in front of its
                     chest; the left hand may be visible beneath the right.  It looks rightward and forward towards Comus and the Lady.
                     Behind and to the left of the Lady's chair stands an old man, who also carries a jar or vase held with
                     both hands before him, his visible wrist positioned to suggest that his arm is bent and held at his side.
                     The old man is bald and his face, neck, and right hand are wrinkled.  His bare feet are visible beneath

                  having been replaced by a forest scene with trees, grass, and sky.  Even the Lady's
                  chair where she is still stiffly seated seems different, now missing a back and any visible
                  coherent design.  Clouds of gray smoke nearly fill the left side of the design, billowing
                  from behind the Lady's chair and from flames
                  rising along the ground near Comus' feet; more flames appear between the
                  brothers' striding legs.  Comus' undulating blue cloak seems to merge with the billows of smoke,
                  which nearly surround him.  Four heads that may belong to Comus' followers seem to float in the smoke
                  clouds above the fleeing Comus.  Comus, both arms raised, is still carrying his staff or rod
                  in his right hand, but one of the brothers has seized the goblet and bears it aloft.  Both brothers
                  hold their swords high in nearly-parallel positions and stride to the left with mirror-image
                  strides.  The Lady, still seated in the chair, remains facing rightward with her arms resting along

                     Comus is shown fleeing leftward away from the pursuing brothers.  He still carries
                     his rod in his right hand, with both arms raised above his head, but one of the 
                     brothers has seized the goblet.  Comus' raised left hand is open, palm facing down
                     and to the right, and fingers spread towards the brothers.  He strides leftward with
                     bent right leg, left leg extended to the right and left foot on tiptoe.  His body
                     faces forward and his head is bent to the right; his mouth may be slightly open.  He may be looking at the brothers.
                     Comus is clothed in transparent tights that end at his wrists and just below his
                     knees, and his blue cloak billows behind him, merging with the clouds of smoke.  He
                     wears slipper-like shoes.

                     Comus is still carrying his rod, but one of the brothers—the one closest
                     to the viewer—has seized the goblet and bears it aloft in his left hand.  
                     He looks left toward Comus.  The brother furthest from
                     the viewer holds his left arm raised at 135 degrees, his palm vertical and facing
                     out from his body.  This brother turns his head to look forward, his mouth open.
                     Both brothers hold their swords in their right hands, with right arms behind them
                     and raised high in nearly-parallel positions.  They step to the left with mirror-image
                     strides, each with a leg extended behind, trailing foot on tiptoe.  Both wear semi-transparent tights that
                     end at their wrist and ankles.  The nearest brother is wearing slipper-like shoes
                     and a belt (or his tights cinch at the waist); the other may be wearing similar shoes,
                     but they are harder to distinguish.  Both brothers have curly (and fairly short?) hair.

                     that covers much of her hair.  She looks downward, facing to the left.  A few strands of hair
                     escape from her scarf at her left temple, and additional strands, or folds of her scarf, cascade
                     over her shoulder and hang below her face.  A smaller, bald head rests on her shoulder, enveloped
                     in her hair or folds of cloth, as if it belongs to a baby that the woman is holding.  But the features
                     and expression on the face of this head, which looks outward, suggest those of a disgruntled old man.
                     Below the woman hovers another smaller head, also facing forward and to the right.  Its mouth appears to be open.  A 
                     pair of bat-like wings stretch leftward from this head.  To the left of the wings, and somewhat between
                     them, is the head of what appears to be a bald old man, perhaps with a mustache and possibly a beard.
                     This head looks upward and to the right, and is roughly the same size as the second two heads.  Another
                     bat-wing structure appears to the right of the woman's shoulder.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="CD"><characteristic>Lady</characteristic><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>young</characteristic><characteristic>virgin</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>arms at side</characteristic><characteristic>arms bent</characteristic><characteristic>arms on lap</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>hands on knees</characteristic><characteristic>palms down</characteristic><characteristic>legs bent</characteristic><characteristic>right foot</characteristic><characteristic>sitting</characteristic><characteristic>rigid</characteristic><characteristic>shoes</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The Lady is seated stiffly just to the right of Comus, facing right.

                  enchantment.  Sabrina hovers, partly kneeling, to the right of the Lady and extends her open right hand
                  towards the Lady at shoulder-height.  In her left hand the river goddess holds a large scallop shell
                  at waist level.  The brothers stand next to each other on the other side of the Lady and bend 
                  over her.  The brother farthest from the viewer clasps his hands under his chin, while the closer
                  brother's visible right arm is at his side.  At the center of attention in this scene sits the Lady,
                  now much less rigidly than in previous designs.  Though her legs lie facing right, she turns her 
                  upper body to face forward and holds her raised hands out from her body with the palms up.  Her head
                  up, she looks slightly leftward toward her brothers.  The attendant Spirit stands in his shepherd's guise at the far left
                  of the design, gesturing upward with his right hand and looking rightward towards the Lady.  Two of
                  Sabrina's nymphs kneel or hover near her at the right side of the design.  A pool or stream of water, 
                  which perhaps represents the Severn, extends from their gowns to the bottom of the design on the right.
                  A rainbow arches from the right side of the design over Sabrina's head, to fade just right of the Lady's head.
                  The Lady herself is seated on what appears to be a rock or large stone.  Vegetation in the background fills in 
                  the spaces around the figures.  At least two large hills or mountains appear above the trees.  Rays
                  of light shoot over the horizon above the valley between the mountains, further lighting a blue sky.

                     the water behind or below her.

                     At the center of attention in this scene is the Lady, now much less rigid than in previous
                     designs.  Though her legs lie facing right, she turns her upper body to face forward and holds
                     her raised hands out from her body with the palms facing up and out and the fingers of her left hand slightly spread.  Her arms are at her side,
                     but bent upward at the elbows. Her head up, she looks slightly leftward toward her brothers.  Her right foot, perhaps
                     wearing a slipper or shoe of some sort, is visible below the hem of her gown.  Just above the right foot may be he upper part of the left foot.  Her hair is long
                     and curly; her mouth is slightly open, as though she is speaking.

                     elbows, his hands held together under his chin as if in prayer.  With the front-most brother's bent head faces directly
                     towards the Lady, the rear brother looks slightly forward and down toward the Lady.  They are both wearing shoes

                     her left arm is visible, at her side and bent at the elbow; she appears to be holding a shell (perhaps a
                     conch or whelk) in front of her chest.  Her long hair may be braided or adorned with pearls or beads across the
                     crown of her head.  She seems to be looking at Sabrina or the Lady.  The nymph to the left of Sabrina's is
                     seen partly from behind, but since her head looks towards the Lady, the viewer can see a partial left
                     profile of her face.  Her left arm is visible at her side, bent upward at the elbow.  With her left
                     hand, she holds a large whelk shell in front of her chest.  Braids or jewels decorate her hair across
                     the top of her head, and her long hair appears to be gathered at the nape of her neck.  Her legs extend
                     behind her and her left foot is visible below or through her semi-transparent gown.  Both nymphs wear

                     tights have a wide v-shaped neckline.  The brother on the left, who is standing slightly in front of the other, is
                     seen from behind.  He is standing with his weight on his right foot, left leg bent, and craning his neck backward

                     as his brother's.  Both brothers' tights have belts, or more likely, well-defined waistbands.  The left brother's left foot, and the righ brother's right foot, are on tiptoe.
