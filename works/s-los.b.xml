            The editors of the William Blake Archive are pleased to announce the publication of seven new electronic editions of Blake's illuminated books. They are: <hi rend="i">The [First] Book of Urizen</hi> Copy G, <hi rend="i">The Book of Los</hi> Copy A, <hi rend="i">The Book of Ahania</hi> Copy A, <hi rend="i">The Song of Los</hi> Copy B, <hi rend="i">America, a Prophecy</hi> Copy A, <hi rend="i">Europe, a Prophecy</hi> Copy E, and <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> Copy F.<lb/><lb/>
            We had announced <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> Copy G as forthcoming two months ago, but formatting the double-columned text diplomatically in SGML for both Netscape and Internet Explorer proved more taxing and time consuming than anticipated. Such are the joys and tribulations of electronic publishing. Solving the problems there, though, ensured diplomatic transcriptions for Blake's other books with double-columned texts, <hi rend="i">The Book of Ahania</hi> and <hi rend="i">The Book of Los</hi>. Together, these three works are often referred to as Blake's Bible of Hell or, simply, the Urizen books. <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi>, of which there are only seven extant copies, was first produced in 1794, color printed to form Copies A, C, D, E (untraced), F, and J. It was printed again in 1795 to form Copy B, which was produced as part of a set of illuminated books printed on large paper, and then one last time in c. 1818 to form Copy G, which was produced in Blake's late printing and coloring style. The editors are currently working on Copies A, B, C, and F and expect to have them in the Archive by the end of the year. <hi rend="i">The Book of Ahania</hi> and <hi rend="i">The Book of Los</hi> exist in unique copies, with only a few proof impressions extant. They were printed in 1795 and executed in intaglio instead of in relief etching, the technique Blake normally used for his illuminated books. Although their texts are printed in intaglio, their frontispieces are beautifully color printed from the surface of the plates.<lb/><lb/>
            With <hi rend="i">The Song of Los</hi>, which consists of two parts entitled "Africa" and "Asia," we complete Blake's other series of illuminated books, sometimes known as the Continental Prophecies, begun in 1793 with <hi rend="i">America</hi> and continued in 1794 with <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>. The copy of <hi rend="i">The Song of Los</hi> included here is one of six extant; all were color printed in the same printing session in 1795.<lb/><lb/>
            With fourteen complete copies extant, <hi rend="i">America</hi> is not as rare as these other illuminated books, but Copy A, which was printed and colored in 1795 as part of Blake's large-paper set of books, is, along with Copies K, O, and M, one of only four colored copies—and it was the model for Copy K. Moreover, only it and Copy O have the last four lines on Plate 4, which was masked in the printing of the other copies. The Archive will include Copies M and O (c. 1807 and 1818) later this year.<lb/><lb/>
            Only nine copies of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> are extant, and only two of those, Copies H and O (1795 and 1818), have Plate 3, the Preludium. The Archive will include both of these Copies by the end of the year. Copy E, included here, was lightly color printed on both sides of the paper in 1794 and joins Copy B, color printed more heavily on one side of the paper the same year.<lb/><lb/><hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> Copy F is an exquisitely beautiful copy, heavily color printed (especially its frontispiece) in c. 1794, and never before reproduced. It joins Copies C and J (both 1793), and will be joined later this year by Copies G and P (1795 and 1818).<lb/><lb/>
            All of these editions have newly edited texts; all images in the editions were scanned from either 4x5 or 8x10 transparencies, nearly all of which were made specifically for the Archive. Like our other editions, these are all SGML-encoded, fully searchable for both text and images and supported by the unique Inote and ImageSizer applications described in our previous updates.<lb/><lb/>
            The Archive now contains sixteen copies of ten illuminated books. In the coming months, we will be adding copies of <hi rend="i">All Religions are One</hi>, <hi rend="i">There is No Natural Religion</hi>, <hi rend="i">For the Sexes</hi>, <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, along with copies of books already in the Archive but from different printings. Our goal is to have the entire illuminated canon online this year. In addition, work continues on the SGML edition of David V. Erdman's <hi rend="i">Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</hi>, which we anticipate releasing sometime this spring.

is open; its forked tongue hangs down.  The reptilian theme is 
continued by a small lizard, apparently climbing the first 
diagonal of the first "A" in the heading.  Many vines, some with 
loops and spirals (far left), and a few leaves also play about 
and are intertwined with the heading.  Several flying insects, 
perhaps moths or butterflies, are also pictured, particularly 
below the first "A" and the "F" of the heading and just below and left of 
the final "A."  A bird with extended wings flies below the 
snake's tail where it twists below the final "A" of the heading.  
Below, with five lines of text intervening, is the lower half of 
what is probably a unified composition, particularly given the 
marginal vegetation linking them.  On the left is a nude young 
male, probably a shepherd boy, lying on the ground in a 
contracted posture and probably sleeping.  The downward-directed 
mouth of the serpent above may be threatening him.  The male's 
legs are drawn up and his head, with curly hair, rests face down 
on his left arm.  To the right is at least one sheep, also lying 
on the ground with its face on the left.  Further to the right 
may be more sheep plus some vegetation.  Above this area, and

the text, an embracing couple runs to the right.  These are 
probably Har and Heva, who "fled" from the "War &amp; Lust" of "their 
brethren" (lines 6-7).  They face forward, but may be looking back to 
the left.  Both faces express fear or horror.  The male is nude 
and has his mouth slightly open, as though speaking or uttering a 
cry.  The female wears a skirt but would appear to be undraped 
above the waist.  The female's hair is long, the man's curly.  
They appear to be fleeing from some unrepresented presence on the 
left.  The man's left arm holds the woman's waist; his right arm 
is not visible.  The woman's left arm is wrapped around the 
man's head.  Her right arm is extended at 135 degrees, with the 
palm facing to the left as though fending off a pursuer.  The 
ground on which they run may be covered with low vegetation.  A 
hill rises on the right; left of the figures is a dark sky 
streaked with red, perhaps indicating a sunrise or sunset.  A mountain, perhaps partly covered with snow, rises in the right background.  Just 
above, in the cloud or text panel into which the woman's right 
arm extends, are two birds with wings extended.  The entire scene 
is apocalyptic.  Above, on the upper cloud or text panel, is a

The ground from 
which the lily plant grows is not clearly represented, but there 
may be a river behind its stems.  If we assume that this is a 
plant of normal size, then the human figures are diminutive, 
perhaps fairies.  The female, wearing a gown that seemingly does 
not cover her left shoulder, lies on one blossom with eyes 
closed; she may be asleep.  Her head rests on her right arm and 
hand.  Her hair is long.  The male wears a long gown and a 
separate cloak.  He is crowned, and thus probably a king; by 
association, the woman may be a queen.  His eyes are open and he 
faces forward.  He has long hair and a beard.  He is more seated than lying on his blossom, with 
his upper body propped up with his right arm.  He holds a scepter 
in his left hand.  The night sky in the distance contains a few 
indications of stars.  The design is based loosely on a 
monochrome wash drawing, now usually attributed to Blake's 
brother Robert, in Blake's Notebook, page 5.  There is also a 
separate water color of the design by William Blake (private 
collection).  The two figures have traditionally been identified 
as Oberon and Titania, although the relevance of Shakespeare's <hi rend="i">A 
Midsummer Night's Dream</hi> to *The Song of Los* is not immediately 
apparent.  Other critics have identified the figures as Har and 
Heva, as on Plate 4.  Perhaps, given the cosmic scale of Plate 8, this plate represents the microscopic world of the Blakean 
imagination.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="B"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>cloak</characteristic><characteristic>reclining</characteristic><characteristic>sitting</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>leg dangling</characteristic><characteristic>leg drawn up</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>arm braced</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>scepter</characteristic><characteristic>crown</characteristic><characteristic>arm at side</characteristic><characteristic>fairy</characteristic><characteristic>king</characteristic><characteristic>Har</characteristic><characteristic>Oberon</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A male figure, wearing a gown and a separate cloak,

would seem to be treated as a single, interrelated pictorial 
image.  Several figures, not very clearly defined, disport among 
the letters of the heading ("ASIA," line 2).  A seated figure, with knees 
drawn up, appears just left of the first letter.  This figure, of 
uncertain gender, has her or his head lowered.  Within the upper 
loop of the second letter, a figure clutches his head and falls 
head first.  Two embracing figures, poorly defined but probably a 
male and female, stride to the left just left of the lower part 
of the letter "I."  An ill-defined cluster of lines may be a 
seated figure at the lower parts of the final "A."  The sky 
behind the heading contains clouds and is streaked with red, 
perhaps representing a sunrise or sunset.  Below, we see a great 
tree arching over from left to right.  In a cave-like niche below 
the tree are two figures, a nude male holding a gowned woman.  He 
squats or sits on the ground, apparently with his head lowered 
since we see only the curly hair on the top of his head.  The 
female's head and left arm fall downward; she may be dead.
The dark green coloring to the left of the man and woman may be vegetation.
Undifferentiated vegetation continues down both margins of the 
text; some vine-like shapes intrude between lines of text and 
fill areas on the right of the text.  A nude figure, probably male, sits or kneels in an extremely 
contracted posture in the lower right corner of the plate.  His 
left leg is drawn up to his left shoulder.  His head is turned to 
the left (his face is not pictured); he clutches his lowered head
