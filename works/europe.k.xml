                                                  looks down or has his eyes closed; his left arm is
                                                  extended down. He holds a pair of dividers or
                                                  compasses in his left hand, with his forefinger
                                                  spread away from his other fingers. Slight
                                                  indications of a robe or some sort of drapery
                                                  appear just right of the figure's left foot. Beams
                                                  of light emanate from the circle, surrounded by
                                                  clouds except where the man's arm extends
                                                  downward. The upper third of the disc is also
                                                  partly covered with thin clouds in this copy. The
                                                  figure is very probably Urizen in the act of
                                                  creating and/or circumscribing the material

                                                  above the text. A nude male sits crouching in a
                                                  contracted posture within a cave surrounded at its
                                                  mouth with large stones. His legs are drawn up and
                                                  crossed at the ankles. He faces to the
                                                  left, toward the other figure. His left arm is
                                                  bent at the elbow, with his forearm and index
                                                  finger on his left hand point up. He grasps a
                                                  knife or dagger in his right hand. He may be an
                                                  assassin, contemplating the murder of the figure
                                                  to the left. This figure on the left is a youthful
                                                  male wearing tights, a hat, a bundle or backpack
                                                  on his back, and belts over his chest. He strides
                                                  forward and to the left. He faces left and holds a
                                                  walking-stick in his right hand. His left arm is
                                                  bent at the elbow, with his left forearm and hand
                                                  behind his back. He is probably one of Blake's
                                                  representations of a traveler. Below his feet is a
                                                  path or road. Right and left of this walking
                                                  figure, and above the cave with the assassin, are
                                                  the leaves of plants or trees. There are also the
                                                  leaves of plants below the traveler. A rosy tint

                                                  surrounded tightly by the figure's right arm and
                                                  snake-like drapery. The ends of this drapery curve
                                                  over the head and to the left, where it forms two
                                                  loops. The figure seems to be flying on its large,
                                                  bat-like wings. Ten birds fly near the figure,
                                                  above him and below and to the right of his left
                                                  wing. Further to the right, a nude (and bald) male
                                                  falls head-first. His legs are bent at the knees,
                                                  with the left leg drawn up near his chest. His
                                                  arms are raised over his head and bent at the
                                                  elbows with his hands behind his head. A large
                                                  weight is attached to his hands or arms,
                                                  apparently with a single link of a chain that
                                                  disappears behind his head (because attached to
                                                  his hands?) This weight apparently pulls him
                                                  downwards. The spiky forms along the lower margin
                                                  of the plate suggest vegetation.</illusobjdesc>

                                                  <illusobjdesc>There is a good deal of interlinear
                                                  decoration, particularly in the margins of the
                                                  text. Most consists of vines and leaves, but there
                                                  are also a few animals. The first letter of the
                                                  first word, line 3, twists into a spiral vine on
                                                  the left; it descends with one further loop in the
                                                  left margin to line 11. A long, wavy vine extends
                                                  between lines 5 and 6. On it is a long-legged
                                                  spider, just above "other sons" in line 6. To the
                                                  right of the spider is what may be a very faint
                                                  suggestion of a caterpillar. Further to the left,
                                                  under the first word of line 5, is a small form
                                                  that may be a fly, moth, or butterfly. A vine
                                                  trails downward from this same first word ("And")
                                                  in line 5. Just left of the beginning of line 14
                                                  is a flying creature, perhaps an insect of some
                                                  sort. In the bottom left corner of the plate, a
                                                  vine descends from the first letter of the first
                                                  word in the last line of text (line 17). In the
                                                  right margin, another branch of the vine extending
                                                  between lines 5 and 6 descends from the design
                                                  above the text all the way to the lower margin. It
                                                  bears loops, at least two types of leaves, and
                                                  perhaps some fruit or flowers. A butterfly sits on
                                                  the upper reaches of this vine (opposite line 5);
                                                  a worm or caterpillar inches its way across the
                                                  upper reaches of a large, slender leaf opposite
                                                  the space between lines 9 and 10. Other branches
                                                  of this vine extend above the falling figure and
                                                  intertwine with the large leaf to the right of
                                                  this same figure. To the right are the ghostly
                                                  image of two flying birds (more clearly printed in
                                                  other copies). A separate vine with spiky leaves
                                                  twists right of lines 6 and 7, growing from the
                                                  "d" in "thunder." Below one of its tendrils, and
                                                  just to the right of line 9, is a flying insect,
                                                  perhaps a beetle or fly. A somewhat jagged vine
                                                  extends horizontally following line 8; to the

                                                  text, the plate is treated as a full-page design
                                                  showing four nude males hovering in the sky or on
                                                  clouds. The two text panels are shaped like
                                                  clouds; their rosy hue suggests a sunrise or
                                                  sunset. Upper right, we see a figure from behind
                                                  with his left leg bent and his left foot poised on
                                                  a cloud extending down and to the left. His right
                                                  leg is extended; he may be rising. We do not see
                                                  his arms, but his hands clutch his head. This
                                                  gesture suggests despair. His hair is very curly.
                                                  Below is a group of three wrestling figures, all
                                                  nude and bald. The central figure has his legs
                                                  spread, with his left leg extended and his right
                                                  bent at the knee with his right foot below his
                                                  genitals. He looks down and to the right. With his
                                                  right arm he grasps another bald nude around the
                                                  neck, apparently in an attempt to strangle him.
                                                  This central figure's left arm is bent at the
                                                  elbow and he grasps the neck of another bald nude
                                                  with his left hand. The figure on the left has his
                                                  legs spread and bent at the knees. He looks up and
                                                  to the right and tries, with both hands, to
                                                  release the central male's arm from around his
                                                  neck. The wrestler on the right has his legs
                                                  spread, with his left leg extended vertically and
                                                  his right leg bent at the knee. His arms are bent
                                                  back over his shoulders and grasp the left leg of
                                                  the central male. His blue coloring in this copy
                                                  suggests he may be suffocating. All three figures
                                                  have caricature-like facial expressions suggesting
                                                  fear and pain (figures right and left) or
                                                  desperation and cruelty (central figure). The
                                                  background darkness suggests a night
                                                  scene.</illusobjdesc>

                                                  arm is at his side and he holds a large bell in
                                                  his left hand. This bellman, as well as the
                                                  inscription on the door (typical of quarantined
                                                  houses) can be associated with the theme of plague
                                                  dominating the design. Since his mouth is slightly
                                                  open, he may be calling out, "Bring out your
                                                  dead!" Below the bellman on the left are a man and
                                                  woman. The man, wearing a gown or at least a
                                                  shirt, appears against the left margin of the
                                                  plate in profile, facing right and down, and
                                                  perhaps holds the woman with his right arm. His
                                                  face suggests pain or despair; his hair is curly.
                                                  The gowned woman sits on the ground, with her
                                                  upper body propped up by the man. Her hair is long
                                                  and her right arm is at her side. Her face, with
                                                  mouth open like her companion’s, expresses despair
                                                  and perhaps pain, and the limp posture of her body
                                                  indicates that she may be weak with plague. They
                                                  may be suffering from the plague. To the right, a
                                                  gowned woman with long hair seems to be falling on
                                                  her knees. Her arms are raised vertically as if in
                                                  supplication, with the fingers of both hands
                                                  spread apart. She faces up, with her head bent
                                                  back; like her companions, her posture expresses
                                                  the pain and despair indicative of the plague.

                                                  <illusobjdesc>The setting is an enclosed interior
                                                  space with a floor and a stone back wall. A
                                                  fireplace with a grate and an arched top is at the
                                                  center of the back wall and of the composition. A
                                                  coal fire burns on the grate. Above is a large
                                                  cooking pot with a handle suspended from the top
                                                  of the fireplace by a rod with a hook at its lower
                                                  end. Clouds of smoke or steam billow above the
                                                  pot. In the foreground are three figures. On the
                                                  left is a gowned woman, facing right and in an
                                                  extremely contracted posture. She sits or squats
                                                  on a small chair or stool (note the curved form
                                                  far left) with her legs drawn up to her chest and
                                                  her right arm wrapped around her right knee. Her
                                                  head is down between her knees; her right foot is
                                                  prominent. The gowned woman on the right sits in
                                                  an elegant, neoclassical chair. Her prominent
                                                  knees are drawn up toward her chest, with legs
                                                  crossed. Her arms are apparently also crossed,
                                                  with her left hand near her right breast and her
                                                  right hand near her left breast. She wears a
                                                  necklace of beads and faces up with a worried or
                                                  pained expression, perhaps looking at the pot.
                                                  Below the woman in the chair is a male child,
                                                  nude, rigid, and lying supine on a white cloth
                                                  spread on the floor. His eyes are closed and he is
                                                  probably dead. His hair is curly. Some
                                                  interpreters have described this design as a scene
                                                  of famine, including the contemplation of
                                                  cannibalism by the woman above the child's corpse.

                                                  design. The three text panels are shaped like, and
                                                  may represent, clouds floating in the sky. The
                                                  largest figure, hovering horizontally in the air
                                                  just below the heading, is a gowned female. The
                                                  hem of her garment forms a snake-like tail. Her
                                                  body is twisted, facing forward below the waist
                                                  and facing down above the waist. Her long, curled
                                                  hair cascades over (and hence obscures) her face.
                                                  Her arms are bent at the elbows and her hands are
                                                  clasped behind her head. She has large wings, and
                                                  thus may be an angel. More specifically, in the
                                                  context of this poem, she has been identified as
                                                  Enitharmon, a nature goddess of fallen time and
                                                  space, and as the "nameless shadowy female" (Plate
                                                  4, line 3) who wraps a "turban of thick clouds"
                                                  around her "lab'ring head" (Plate 4, line 14).
                                                  Below her cascading hair is a nude, youthful male

                                                  cheeks just below his eyes. He faces forward.
                                                  Flames surround him within the globe. This may be

                                                  to on the plate. The lower left corner of "A" (in
                                                  "A Prophecy" [lines 2-3]) grows into a long vine
                                                  with branches. Standing on this vine, near the
                                                  left foot of the letter, is a human figure facing
                                                  forward. His or her arms, raised vertically, grow
                                                  into limbs of a tree that bend downwards, as with
                                                  a willow. The motif suggests the classical myth of
                                                  Daphne and her vegetating metamorphosis. This
                                                  parallel suggests that the figure is female. On
                                                  the right foot of "A" is a tree, possibly a palm,

                                                  embracing a female. Both hover in the air, with
                                                  the male on the right and facing to the left. Both
                                                  have long hair and appear nude, although the woman
                                                  has a long, snake-like tail of drapery extending
                                                  from her right leg. The man's body is twisted into
                                                  a curve, seen from behind. His left arm is raised
                                                  horizontally and embraces the woman's waist. His
                                                  right leg is extended horizontally. We also see

                                                  a curve matching the man's. Both her arms are
                                                  raised horizontally, with her head facing down.
                                                  These gestures suggest that she is trying to
                                                  escape from the man. In contrast, the couple right
                                                  of the letter "A" is embracing mutually and appear
                                                  to be kissing. The winged male (an angel?) hovers
                                                  horizontally in the air, with his arms raised at
                                                  45 degrees to embrace the woman who hovers
                                                  vertically. She too is winged and may be an angel.
                                                  Her legs are bent back and her arms raised at 135
                                                  degrees to embrace her companion. He faces down
                                                  and to the left; she faces up and to the right.
                                                  Below the "A" is a hunched over, and apparently
                                                  gowned, figure facing to the left. This extremely
                                                  contracted figure, with his or her upper body and
                                                  head bent down to touch the upper legs, sits on a
                                                  cloud outline. Other cloud outlines extend to the
                                                  upper right and below "Prophecy" in the heading.
                                                  On the right, below a cloud outline and above the
                                                  last letter of "Prophecy," two nude figures seen
                                                  from behind soar in the sky, left arms raised
                                                  horizontally and right arms raised at 135 degrees.
                                                  The letters of "Prophecy" are well decorated with
                                                  human figures and vines. Proceeding from left to
                                                  right, these include a vine with leaves or
                                                  lily-like flowers intertwined with the first
                                                  letter and extending to the second. A figure grasps 
                                                  the vertical of the "P" with raised arms and his left 
                                                  leg. His right leg extends downward. Another figure
                                                  stands on the foot of the vertical of the "R" and
                                                  faces to the left with arms raised vertically.
                                                  Above this figure is a small form that may be a
                                                  descending child or infant, arms stretched
                                                  downward toward the adult. The right foot of the
                                                  "R" bears a very small seated figure, hunched over
                                                  and facing to the right. The letter "O" has two
                                                  vines with lily-like flowers. Standing within the
                                                  "O" is a figure facing forward and with left arm
                                                  raised horizontally to hold a shepherd's crook. To
                                                  the right of this shepherd is a small flock of
                                                  sheep. Three vines, or perhaps flames, spring from
                                                  the foot of the second "P." A vine, perhaps with a
                                                  few leaves, is intertwined with the next three
                                                  letters ("HEC"). The final vine in this group
                                                  springs from the foot of the final letter and
                                                  forms a spiral above and to the right of the
                                                  letter. This "Y" also bears three human figures.
                                                  One, seen from behind and with legs spread and
                                                  arms raised vertically, seems to be climbing, with
                                                  the right foot on the foot of the "Y" and the left
                                                  foot on the "C." Above, standing on the top left
                                                  end of the "Y," is a figure facing left who seems
                                                  to lean against a pole, with one or both arms
                                                  raised vertically, or possibly a somewhat larger
                                                  figure walking to the left. Finally, the first
                                                  bend in the vine growing from the right side of
                                                  the final letter bears a seated figure facing
                                                  right, with back slightly hunched over and right
                                                  arm extended to the right knee. This figure holds
                                                  a book or tablet and is probably reading. Two
                                                  flames, or perhaps a flame-like plant, spring from
                                                  the foot of the "Y" on its right
                                                  side.</illusobjdesc>

                                                  figure (probably male) lies supine on this vine.

                                                  grassy ground. He faces down, with his arms bent
                                                  and his head resting on them. Only part of his
                                                  left arm and right hand are visible. His hair is
                                                  curly and a halo of fire surrounds his head. This
                                                  is probably the youthful Orc. Above him, a nude
                                                  female with long, flame-like hair kneels on a
                                                  cloud and leans dramatically to the left. Her left
                                                  leg is extended and her right bent at the knee
                                                  under her torso. Her arms are extended
                                                  horizontally and she holds, and apparently lifts
                                                  with both hands, a cloak, blanket, or heavy
                                                  drapery to uncover the youth below, at whom she is
                                                  looking. She is probably Enitharmon. The five much
                                                  smaller figures above may be her sons and
                                                  daughters. In the left corner of the design, just
                                                  below the text, we see a nude figure lying supine
                                                  on a cloud with legs bent and spread, body twisted
                                                  to the left. The gender of this figure is
                                                  uncertain; his or her posture suggests erotic
                                                  exhaustion. Similar exhaustion is indicated by the
                                                  nude figure to the right. This figure is probably
                                                  female and also lies supine on a cloud. Her body
                                                  is bent back, with her head, right arm, and right
                                                  leg dangling downward. Above and to the right is
                                                  another nude female, lying supine on a cloud with
                                                  her upper body propped up with her bent right arm.
                                                  She faces right and has long hair. Her right leg
                                                  is extended to the right and her left leg bent at
                                                  the knee. Further to the right is an embracing
                                                  couple hovering in the air, with the woman on the
                                                  right. They may be kissing. The nude male, facing
                                                  right, has his legs spread and his right arm
                                                  raised horizontally. The female, facing left, is
                                                  gowned. Her legs are spread apart. Her long hair
                                                  may be gathered into a bun.</illusobjdesc>

                                                  <illusobjdesc>Above the text, a scaly male stands
                                                  between two female angels. He stands in a slightly
                                                  contrapposto posture, facing forward and with his
                                                  legs spread apart. He wears a spiky crown. His
                                                  right arm is slightly bent, with his right hand
                                                  behind his right thigh. He holds a large sword,
                                                  with its point behind his left leg, in his left
                                                  hand. The scales may represent armor, although
                                                  they extend over his face. This may be Rintrah, as
                                                  a personification of military wrath, referred to
                                                  in the text on this plate. Both angels have large
                                                  wings. The angel on the left has her arms folded
                                                  over her chest and looks to the right. The angel
                                                  on the right has her hands together, as if in
                                                  prayer or supplication, and looks to the left.
                                                  Both wear long gowns and have sun-like halos.
                                                  Beams of light, apparently emanating from the
                                                  halos, descend at a 45 degree angle right and left
                                                  of the figures. The vegetative motifs on which the
                                                  figures stand are described as interlinear

                                                  right of the text. In this copy, the etching

                                                  vegetative form, probably more grain stems. The

                                                  end near the right margin in grain tassels. Two
                                                  figures appear within this "C" curve. The nude
                                                  female, on the left, is seen from behind; her long
                                                  hair is formed into a loose bun. She hovers in the
                                                  air, with her right leg extended and her left bent
                                                  at the knee. Her body and head are twisted to the
                                                  right. She holds in her raised right hand, and no
                                                  doubt plays, a large, coiled horn or trumpet. The
                                                  black and orange spots of blight covering the
                                                  grain appear to emanate from the trumpet and the
                                                  one her male companion plays. He is also nude,
                                                  seen from behind, and has his body twisted
                                                  dramatically to the right. His left leg is
                                                  extended, his right bent at the knee as he hovers
                                                  in the air. He holds his coiled horn or trumpet
                                                  with his left hand. Both arms are raised
                                                  horizontally. His hair is curly. Blue tinting

                                                  <illusobjdesc>A gowned male sits on a throne-like
                                                  chair, the chair in turn resting on a cloud. He
                                                  faces forward and wears the triple-crown of a
                                                  Pope. His face, however, may be a caricature of
                                                  George III. He holds on his lap an open book.
                                                  Large, bat- like wings extend from behind his
                                                  arms. The back of his chair resembles the facade
                                                  of a gothic church, with arches and spires right
                                                  and left. In some copies, the figure appears to
                                                  have bat-like ears that merge with the pointed
                                                  arches on the throne behind him. The coloring in
                                                  Copy K suggests that the figure has human ears.
                                                  His gown between his legs seems to contain
                                                  embroidered pictures of perhaps four gowned and
                                                  standing figures. Below this Pope, and below the
                                                  cloud, are two female angels, right and left, with
                                                  large wings. Both have long hair, are gowned, bow
                                                  and look down, and have one arm extended at 45
                                                  degrees. Each has a halo around her head and holds
                                                  in her extended hand a scepter or staff with a
                                                  fleur-de-lis point at its lower termination.
                                                  Snake-like tails project from beneath the angels'
                                                  gowns. The angel on the right looks sharply down
                                                  or has her eyes closed.</illusobjdesc>

                                                  <illusobjdesc>The setting is a stone prison cell
                                                  with stone stairs rising on the right. A prisoner,
                                                  lower left, has shackles on both ankles; the
                                                  shackles are in turn attached to the stone floor
                                                  with two heavy chains. The prisoner is a nude male
                                                  with curly hair who sits on a stone ledge. His
                                                  prominent knees are drawn up to his chest and his
                                                  legs crossed at the ankles. His neck is twisted to
                                                  the right; his head is back and he seems to look
                                                  up at the figure on the right. His arms are bent
                                                  at the elbows with his hands raised, palms facing
                                                  the viewer and fingers spread apart. His gestures
                                                  and open eye indicate fear and perhaps pain. We
                                                  see the male figure on the right from behind as he
                                                  ascends the stairs (right leg extended backwards,
                                                  left leg bent forward). Except for what may be a
                                                  belt(?) around his waist and a cuff or bracelet at
                                                  his right wrist, he is nude. The mottled surface
                                                  of his skin suggests disease or perhaps scales.
                                                  His hair is curly. His right arm is at his side
                                                  and he holds two large keys on a ring in his right
                                                  hand. This last object identifies him as a
                                                  jailor.</illusobjdesc>

                                                  <illusobjdesc>This text plate contains many
                                                  interlinear vines, birds, insects, and three
                                                  snakes. Four or five butterflies appear right of
                                                  lines 2-5. A vine descends from the first letter
                                                  of the first word in line 7. Two vines grow from
                                                  the first letter of the first word in line 10.
                                                  Vines, two or three birds, a leaf, and flames
                                                  decorate the space between lines 6 and 7. A
                                                  butterfly and two other winged insects, two vines
                                                  (one may be a worm), and an odd shape that may be
                                                  two moths flying close together appear between
                                                  lines 9 and 10. A vine with multiple branches and
                                                  leaves wends its way through the margin right of
                                                  lines 9-20. At least one flower, shaped like a
                                                  Meadia, grows close to the right margin of the
                                                  plate, right of line 10. Another such flower
                                                  appears below and to the left of the first one,
                                                  right of line 13. On and around this large vine
                                                  are caterpillars (above and to the right of line
                                                  15 and right of lines 10-11 and 16-17), possibly
                                                  an inch worm below the last word in line 9, a
                                                  spider (right of line 15), and several flying
                                                  insects. Five flying insects (at least one a
                                                  butterfly) follow line 12. A vine descends left of
                                                  the first word in line 16. A large bird, possibly
                                                  an eagle, and three smaller birds or insects fly
                                                  near the right margin of the plate right of lines
                                                  19-21. The last letter of "thy" in line 21 grows
                                                  into a vine with two loops. A vine with many loops
                                                  fills the considerable space between lines 21 and
                                                  22 and descends in the right margin to line 27. On
                                                  this vine are at least two large and two small
                                                  caterpillars, an inch-worm, two snails, at least
                                                  three spiders, at least two insects with wings
                                                  folded, and a bird perched near the right margin
                                                  with its mouth open (because it is singing?), and
                                                  another singing bird, facing right, within the
                                                  vine's loops just left of the first bird. A large
                                                  moth or butterfly appears below "Antamon" in line
                                                  21. A flying insect is pictured far to the right
                                                  of line 24. Below and to the left is a large bird
                                                  (possibly an eagle) soaring upwards, with a flock
                                                  of six or seven birds to the left. The form right
                                                  of lines 27-31 probably represents clouds. A vine
                                                  descends from the second letter of "my" in line
                                                  26. A vine or small tree with leaves and several
                                                  branches grows from the bottom right corner of the
                                                  plate and extends right of lines 29-38.
                                                  Intertwined with this vegetation is a snake,
                                                  facing to the left with its mouth open and its
                                                  forked tongue clearly pictured. Two other snakes,
                                                  both facing left, appear in the bottom margin. The
                                                  right-most snake in the lower margin has a clearly
                                                  pictured tongue. The last letter of the last word
                                                  in line 35 grows into a vine. The background
                                                  coloring suggests sky, possibly with a sunrise or
                                                  sunset on the left. Green coloring just above the
                                                  bottom margin of the plate suggests
                                                  grass.</illusobjdesc>

                                                  <illusobjdesc>Below the text, a nude, muscular
                                                  male with curly hair stands with legs spread
                                                  apart, his genitals clearly visible. His left leg
                                                  is extended to the right, with his left foot on
                                                  the ground. His right leg is bent at the knee with
                                                  his foot on one of at least two stone steps. He
                                                  may be striding to the left. His body faces
                                                  forward, but his head is turned to the right. His
                                                  expression is fearful or pained, with mouth
                                                  slightly open. He may be looking at the flames
                                                  forming the background of the design or at the
                                                  child whose left arm he grasps with his lowered
                                                  left hand. Perhaps the man is the child's father,
                                                  attempting to rescue the child from the flames.
                                                  The child would seem to be a gowned female, with
                                                  long, curly hair. We see her from the side or
                                                  slightly behind, with her face turned up and to
                                                  the left; her right arm is drawn back and raised
                                                  at 135 degrees. Her left leg is extended backward;
                                                  she may be striding to the left. The nude male
                                                  carries, over his right shoulder, the limp body of
                                                  a woman—perhaps the child's mother. She may be
                                                  nude from the waist up. The man's right arm is
                                                  raised, bent at the elbow, and embraces the woman
                                                  around the waist. Her arms and long hair dangle
                                                  down toward the man's right knee. Her skirt or
                                                  gown, and one visible foot, dangle behind the
                                                  man's spread legs. She may be dead or dying. Lower
                                                  left, on top of the steps, is a fluted and broken

                                                  the left includes a loop and one ivy-like leaf.

                                                  has long, slender leaves. At least four insects,

                                                  and one butterfly (below "fury" in line 3 ) fly
                                                  above the vine. Below "of his" in line 3, a bird,

                                                  its wings as if about to fly into the air. An oak

                                                  9 and 10, divides into several branches in the
                                                  right margin, and has one branch arching back to
                                                  the left at line 7. A branch bearing five oak
                                                  leaves and one acorn extends into the right margin
                                                  following line 12. To the right of this branch, a
                                                  bird flies upward on extended wings. A vine with
                                                  two loops grows from the first letter of "FINIS"
