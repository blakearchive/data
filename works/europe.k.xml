            The William Blake Archive www.blakearchive.org is pleased to announce the publication of new electronic editions of <hi rend="i">America a Prophecy</hi> Copy O and <hi rend="i">Europe a Prophecy</hi> Copy K.<lb/><lb/><hi rend="i">America</hi> Copy O and <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> Copy K are both in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, England. They join copies of <hi rend="i">America</hi> and <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> in the Archive from other printings: <hi rend="i">America</hi> Copies E (1793) and A (1795), and <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> Copies B (1794) and E (1794). Copy M of <hi rend="i">America</hi>, from a c. 1807 printing, and Copy H of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> (a unique monochrome copy) from a 1795 printing, are forthcoming.<lb/><lb/>
            The electronic editions have newly edited SGML-encoded texts and new images scanned and color-corrected from first-generation 4x5" transparencies; text and images are each fully searchable and supported by the Inote and ImageSizer applications described in our previous updates.<lb/><lb/>
            With the publication of these two titles, the Archive now contains fully searchable and scalable electronic editions of 43 copies of 18 of Blake's 19 illuminated books in the context of full bibliographic information about each work, careful diplomatic transcriptions of all texts, detailed descriptions of all images, and extensive bibliographies. They also join our searchable SGML-encoded electronic edition of David V. Erdman's <hi rend="i">Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</hi>. With the forthcoming publication of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> Copy E, the Archive will contain at least one copy of each of Blake's works in illuminated printing and multiple copies of most.<lb/><lb/><hi rend="i">America</hi> Copy O is one of fourteen extant copies of <hi rend="i">America</hi> printed by Blake, one of four colored copies, one of two with the full text of Plate 4, one of four without plate e ["Preludium"], and the only copy printed after c. 1807. <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> Copy K is one of nine extant copies printed by Blake, one of only two copies with Plate 3 ["Five windows light the cavern'd Man"], and the only copy printed after 1795. They are extraordinarily beautiful copies, with each impression bordered by one thin line drawn in red ink a few centimeters outside the edge of the image, setting off each page like a miniature painting.<lb/><lb/>
            Produced together in 1821 for the painter John Linnell, Blake's young patron, they were printed in orangish-red ink on one side of J. Whatman paper dated 1818, 1819, and 1820, numbered 1-18, and finished in gold, watercolors, and pen and ink in the same style Blake used in c. 1818 and 1821-22, and 1825-27. Works from these sessions include <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> Copy O, <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> Copy G, <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> Copies Z and AA, and <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> Copy I, which are in the Archive, and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> Copy E, <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> Copy P, <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> Copy D, and <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> Copy G, each of which will soon enter the Archive.

particularly in the margins of the text.  Most consists of vines 
and leaves, but there are also a few animals.  The first letter 
of the first word, line 3, twists into a spiral vine on the left; it descends with one further loop in the left margin to line 11. 
A long, wavy vine extends between lines 5 and 6.  On it is a 
long-legged spider, just above "other sons" in line 6.  To the right of the spider is what may be a very faint suggestion of a caterpillar. 
Further to the left, under the first word of line 5, is a small 
form that may be a fly, moth, or butterfly.  A vine trails 
downward from this same first word ("And") in line 5.  Just left of the beginning of line 14 is a 
flying creature, perhaps an insect of some sort.  In the bottom 
left corner of the plate, a vine descends from the first letter 
of the first word in the last line of text (line 17).  In the right margin, 
another branch of the vine extending between lines 5 and 6 descends from the design above the text all the way to the lower 
margin.  It bears loops, at least two types of leaves, and perhaps some fruit or flowers.  A butterfly sits on the upper reaches of this vine (opposite line 5); a worm or caterpillar inches its way across the upper reaches of a large, slender leaf opposite the space between lines 9 and 10.  Other branches of this vine extend above the falling figure and intertwine with the large leaf to the right of this same figure.  To the right are the ghostly image of two flying birds (more clearly printed in other copies).  A separate vine with 
spiky leaves twists right of lines 
6 and 7, growing from the "d" in "thunder."  Below one of its tendrils, and just to the right of 
line 9, is a flying insect, perhaps a beetle or fly.  A somewhat 
jagged vine extends horizontally following line 8; to the right 
is another vine, growing from the top of the second letter of 
"of" in line 9.  The etching border right of the text has been developed into vaguely vegetative forms.  The etching border on the left vaguely resembles the side of a tree trunk or a cliff.</illusobjdesc><component type="animal" location="D"><characteristic>butterfly</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A butterfly sits on the upper reaches of the vine

treated as a full-page design showing four nude males hovering in 
the sky or on clouds.  The two text panels are shaped like 
clouds; their rosy hue suggests a sunrise or sunset.  Upper right, we see a figure from behind with his left 
leg bent and his left foot poised on a cloud extending 
down and to the left.  His right leg is extended; he may be 
rising.  We do not see his arms, but his hands clutch his head.  
This gesture suggests despair.  His hair is very curly.  Below is 
a group of three wrestling figures, all nude and bald.  The 
central figure has his legs spread, with his left leg extended 
and his right bent at the knee with his right foot below his genitals.  He looks 
down and to the right.  With his right arm he grasps another bald 
nude around the neck, apparently in an attempt to strangle him.  
This central figure's left arm is bent at the elbow and he grasps 
the neck of another bald nude with his left hand.  The figure on 
the left has his legs spread and bent at the knees.  He looks up 
and to the right and tries, with both hands, to release the 
central male's arm from around his neck.  The wrestler on the 
right has his legs spread, with his left leg extended vertically 
and his right leg bent at the knee.  His arms are bent back over 
his shoulders and grasp the left leg of the central male.  His blue coloring in this copy suggests he may be suffocating.  All

worried expression, and wears a large and dark bicorn hat.  His 
left arm is at his side and he holds a large bell in his left

a great deal of interlinear decoration, the major pictorial 
motifs—the sky and the two largest figures—constitute a full- 
plate design.  The three text panels are shaped like, and may 
represent, clouds floating in the sky.  The largest figure, 
hovering horizontally in the air just below the heading, is a 
gowned female.  The hem of her garment forms a snake-like tail.  Her body is twisted, facing forward below the waist and facing down above the waist.  Her long, curled hair cascades over (and 
hence obscures) her face.  Her arms are bent at the elbows and 
her hands are clasped behind her head.  She has large 
wings, and thus may be an angel.  More specifically, in the 
context of this poem, she has been identified as Enitharmon, a 
nature goddess of fallen time and space, and as the "nameless 
shadowy female" (Plate 4, line 3) who wraps a 
"turban of thick clouds" around her "lab'ring head" (Plate 4, line 14).  Below 
her cascading hair is a nude, youthful male in a contracted 
posture.  He seems confined by the circle in which he sits.  This 
circle may be meant to represent a globe; it has been described 
as a comet, although there is no tail.  It may be a planet.  His 
legs are bent at the knees and drawn up to his chest; his arms 
are bent at the elbows with his hands, formed into fists, against 
his cheeks just below his eyes.  He faces forward.  Flames surround him within the globe.  This may be Orc, the spirit of revolution here confined, 
the "secret child" (of Enitharmon?) mentioned on the plate (line 5), 
or one of Enitharmon's "vig'rous progeny of fires" (Plate 5, line 9).  The other motifs on this plate, including many human figures, will be treated as interlinear designs.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="AB"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>snake-like</characteristic><characteristic>tail</characteristic><characteristic>twisted</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing down</characteristic><characteristic>hovering</characteristic><characteristic>body horizontal</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>wing</characteristic><characteristic>angel</characteristic><characteristic>arms bent</characteristic><characteristic>arms wrapped around head</characteristic><characteristic>hands behind head</characteristic><characteristic>hands clutching head</characteristic><characteristic>Enitharmon</characteristic><characteristic>nameless shadowy female</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The largest figure on the plate, hovering

vegetative motifs.  The figures, particularly the larger ones, 
may be the "sons &amp; daughters" (line 8) of Enitharmon referred to on 
the plate.  The lower left corner of "A" (in "A Prophecy" [lines 2-3]) grows 
into a long vine with branches.  Standing on this vine, near the 
left foot of the letter, is a human figure facing forward.  His 
or her arms, raised vertically, grow into limbs of a tree that 
bend downwards, as with a willow.  The motif suggests the 
classical myth of Daphne and her vegetating metamorphosis.  This 
parallel suggests that the figure is female.  On the right foot 
of "A" is a tree, possibly a palm, with branches that bend 
downward.  This tree is also slightly anthropomorphic in this copy.  To the left of the "A" and slightly below it is a male 
embracing a female.  Both hover in the air, with the male on the 
right and facing to the left.  Both have long hair and appear 
nude, although the woman has a long, snake-like tail of drapery 
extending from her right leg.  The man's body is twisted into a 
curve, seen from behind.  His left arm is raised horizontally and 
embraces the woman's waist.  His right leg is extended 
horizontally.  We also see the woman from behind, with her body 
twisted into a curve matching the man's.  Both her arms are 
raised horizontally, with her head facing down.  These gestures 
suggest that she is trying to escape from the man.  In contrast, 
the couple right of the letter "A" is embracing mutually and 
appear to be kissing.  The winged male (an angel?) hovers 
horizontally in the air, with his arms raised at 45 degrees to 
embrace the woman who hovers vertically.  She too is winged and 
may be an angel.  Her legs are bent back and her arms raised at 
135 degrees to embrace her companion.  He faces down and to the 
left; she faces up and to the right.  Below the "A" is a hunched 
over, and apparently gowned, figure facing to the left.  This 
extremely contracted figure, with his or her upper body and head 
bent down to touch the upper legs, sits on a cloud outline.  
Other cloud outlines extend to the upper right and below 
"Prophecy" in the heading.  On the right, below a cloud outline 
and above the last letter of "Prophecy," two nude figures seen 
from behind soar in the sky, left arms raised horizontally and 
right arms raised at 135 degrees.  The letters of "Prophecy" are 
well decorated with human figures and vines.  Proceeding 
from left to right, these include a vine with leaves or lily-like 
flowers intertwined with the first letter and extending to the 
second.  A figure stands on the foot of the vertical of the 
"R" and faces to the left with arms raised vertically.  Above 
this figure is a small form that may be a descending child or 
infant, arms stretched downward toward the adult.  The right foot 
of the "R" bears a very small seated figure, hunched over and 
facing to the right.  The letter "O" has two vines with lily-like 
flowers.  Standing within the "O" is a figure facing forward and 
with left arm raised horizontally to hold a shepherd's crook.  To 
the right of this shepherd is a small flock of sheep.  Three 
vines, or perhaps flames, spring from the foot of the second "P." 
A vine, perhaps with a few leaves, is intertwined with the next 
three letters ("HEC").  The final vine in this group springs from 
the foot of the final letter and forms a spiral above and to the 
right of the letter.  This "Y" also bears three human figures.  
One, seen from behind and with legs spread and arms raised 
vertically, seems to be climbing, with the right foot on the foot 
of the "Y" and the left foot on the "C."  Above, standing on the 
top left end of the "Y," is a figure facing left who seems to 
lean against a pole, with one or both arms raised vertically, or possibly a somewhat larger figure walking to the left.  
Finally, the first bend in the vine 
growing from the right side of the final letter bears a seated 
figure facing right, with back slightly hunched over and right 
arm extended to the right knee.  This figure holds a book or 
tablet and is probably reading.  Two flames, or perhaps a
flame-like plant, spring from the foot of the "Y" on its right
side.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="AB"><characteristic>group of figures</characteristic><characteristic>Enitharmon's son</characteristic><characteristic>Enitharmon's daughter</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The human figures surrounding the heading,

His gown between his legs seems to contain embroidered pictures of perhaps four

Both have long hair, are gowned, bow and look down, and have one

curly hair who sits on a stone ledge.  His prominent knees are

birds, insects, and three snakes.  Four or five
butterflies appear right of lines 2-5.  A vine descends from the 
first letter of the first word in line 7.  Two vines grow from 
the first letter of the first word in line 10.  Vines, two or 
three birds, a leaf, and flames decorate the space 
between lines 6 and 7.  A butterfly and two other winged insects, 
two vines (one may be a worm), and an odd shape that may be two 
moths flying close together appear between lines 9 and 10.  A vine 
with multiple branches and leaves wends its way through the 
margin right of lines 9-20.  At least one flower, shaped like a 
Meadia, grows close to the right margin of the plate, right of 
line 10.  Another such flower appears below and to the left of the 
first one, right of line 13.  On and around this large vine are 
caterpillars (above and to the right of line 15 and right of 
lines 10-11 and 16-17), possibly an inch worm below the last word in line 9, a spider (right of line 15), and several flying 
insects.  Five flying insects (at least one a butterfly) follow 
line 12.  A vine descends left of the first word in line 16.  A large bird, possibly an eagle, and three 
smaller birds or insects fly near the right margin of the plate 
right of lines 19-21.  The last letter of "thy" in line 21 grows into a vine with two loops.  A vine with many loops fills the 
considerable space between lines 21 and 22 and descends in the 
right margin to line 27.  On this vine are at least two large and 
two small caterpillars, an inch-worm, two snails, at least three 
spiders, at least two insects with wings folded, and a bird perched near the right margin with its mouth 
open (because it is singing?), and another singing bird, facing right, within the vine's loops just left of the first bird.  A large moth or butterfly appears 
below "Antamon" in line 21.  A flying insect is pictured far to the right of 
line 24.  Below and to the left is a large bird (possibly an 
eagle) soaring upwards, with a flock of six or seven birds to the left.  
The form right of lines 27-31 probably represents clouds.  A 
vine descends from the second letter of "my" in line 26.  A vine 
or small tree with leaves and several branches grows from the bottom right corner of the plate and extends right of lines 29-38.  Intertwined with this vegetation is a snake, facing to the left with its mouth open and its forked tongue clearly pictured.  Two other snakes, both facing left, appear in 
the bottom margin.  The right-most snake in the lower margin has 
a clearly pictured tongue.  The last letter of the last word in 
line 35 grows into a vine.  The background coloring suggests sky, possibly with a sunrise or sunset on the left.  Green coloring just above the bottom margin of the plate suggests grass.</illusobjdesc><component type="object" location="E"><characteristic>sky</characteristic><characteristic>cloud</characteristic><characteristic>sunrise</characteristic><characteristic>sunset</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The background coloring suggests sky, possibly with a sunrise or sunset on the left.

motifs and animals.  Three vines extend horizontally between lines 3 and 
4.  The vine on the left includes a loop and one ivy-like leaf.  
The next vine to the right bears two oak or grape leaves.  The 
largest vine, furthest to the right, has long, slender leaves.  
At least four insects, most likely beetles and caterpillars, crawl on it.  Three winged insects (one little more than a dot) and one butterfly (below 
"fury" in line 3 ) fly above the vine.  Below "of his" in line 3, 
a bird, seen from behind, perches on the vine but spreads its 
wings as if about to fly into the air.  An oak or grape leaf 
descends from the first word in line 4 and into the far left 
margin.  A vine with ivy-like leaves extends horizontally between lines 9 and 10, divides into 
several branches in the right margin, and has one branch arching 
back to the left at line 7.  A branch bearing five oak leaves and 
one acorn extends into the right margin following line 12.  To the right of this branch, a bird flies upward on 
extended wings.  A vine with two loops grows from the first 
letter of "FINIS" (line 13) and extends horizontally above the 
word.
