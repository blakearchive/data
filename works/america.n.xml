<updatestmt> 
The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of digital editions of three posthumous copies of <hi rend="i">America a Prophecy</hi>. Copies N and Q were printed by Catherine Blake, c. 1829, and are in the Auckland Public Library and Princeton University Library respectively. Copy P, in the Fitzwilliam Museum, was printed c. 1832 by Frederick Tatham, one of a group of young artists who befriended Blake at the end of his life, calling him the “Interpreter” and themselves the “Ancients.” Tatham cared for Catherine Blake after Blake died in August 1827 and obtained all of Blake’s effects, including the copperplates of Blake's illuminated books, after Catherine died in October 1831. The posthumous copies join <hi rend="i">America</hi> Copies A, B, E, F, M, and O, already in the Archive, and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> Copy I, a posthumous copy printed by Tatham c. 1832.<lb/>
                <lb/>
Posthumous copies of illuminated books (of <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>, <hi rend="i">America</hi>, <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>) are part of Blake's reception history in the nineteenth century. They are also important bibliographically because they accurately reveal the copperplate designs and texts, usually more so than lifetime impressions, which were often printed without plate borders and finished in watercolors, with texts touched up and even altered in pen and ink.<lb/>
                <lb/>
<hi rend="i">America a Prophecy</hi>, dated 1793, was the first of Blake's "Continental Prophecies," followed by <hi rend="i">Europe a Prophecy</hi> in 1794, executed in the same style and size but usually colored, and, in 1795, "Africa" and "Asia," two sections making up <hi rend="i">The Song of Los</hi>. Fine and important examples of all three books are in the Archive.<lb/>
                <lb/>
Blake described <hi rend="i">America</hi> as folio in the 1793 Prospectus and, along with <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>, in his 1818 letter to Dawson Turner. All lifetime copies were folio in size—approximately 37 x 27 cm., which are quarters of Imperial sheets—except <hi rend="i">America</hi> Copy O and <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> Copy K, the last copies that Blake printed, in 1821 for John Linnell, which are quarto in size, at 30 x 24 cm. Catherine Blake appears to have used these late copies as her model, printing <hi rend="i">America</hi> Copy Q and <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> Copy L as matching quartos, at 29.5 x 22.1 cm., on Ruse and Turner laid paper dated 1812. She printed <hi rend="i">America</hi> Copy N and <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> Copy I as matching quartos, at 32.6 x 23.6 cm., on T. Stains wove paper dated 1813. Tatham also paired the two books, printing <hi rend="i">America</hi> Copy P with <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> Copy M as quartos, at 28 x 22.8 cm., on J. Whatman 1832 wove paper.<lb/>
                <lb/>
<hi rend="i">America</hi> comprises eighteen major text and design plates and a small plate (e) bearing the word "Preludium" and printed above the design on Plate 3. Ten of the fourteen lifetime extant copies of <hi rend="i">America</hi> were printed in 1793 on both sides of leaves in bluish and greenish black inks and left uncolored. The last five lines of Plate 4 were masked and did not print, and Plate 13 was printed in its first of two states. She and Tatham printed Plate 4 unmasked, Plates 11 and 13 in their second (final) states, and did not print Plate e. They both printed on one side of the leaf and left the impressions uncolored, but the similarities end there.<lb/>
                <lb/>
Catherine Blake’s impressions are closer in appearance and feel to Blake’s impressions than Tatham’s. She printed in black intaglio ink on dampened paper, resulting in reticulated surfaces and designs shrinking slightly smaller than the plates upon drying. Moreover, she touched up impressions in light washes and numbered them in the top right corner. These features are characteristic of Blake’s practice and differentiate her books from <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> Copies H, I, and J; <hi rend="i">America</hi> Copy P; <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> Copy M; <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> Copies a, b, c, d, e, g, h, i, j, and p, and loose impressions; and <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> Copy T—that is, from all the books printed on J. Whatman 1831 and 1832 papers by Tatham. He printed on dry paper in relief ink, usually sepia (a brownish red), a hue never used by Blake, and occasionally black, which transferred without reticulating. He did not touch up impressions or number them. Catherine Blake no doubt knew how Blake printed illuminated books from having assisted him in their production.<lb/>
                <lb/>
<hi rend="i">America</hi> Copy Q, though initially uncolored, is now colored because Walter T. Spencer, who acquired it and <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> Copy L between 1913 and 1918, had them colored before selling them as Blake’s printing and coloring. <hi rend="i">America</hi> Copy Q’s coloring was modeled on William Muir’s 1887 lithographic facsimile of <hi rend="i">America</hi> Copy A and went undetected as posthumous until it was exhibited in Philadelphia in 1939. The status of the coloring was confirmed by Geoffrey Keynes and Edwin Wolf in their 1953 <hi rend="i">Census</hi>. They also confirmed that <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> Copy L was posthumously colored, but they did not report posthumous printing for either book. That possibility was first suggested by G. E. Bentley, Jr., in his 1977 <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> and, for <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> Copy L, confirmed by Robert N. Essick in his 1985 catalogue of the Huntington collection. The identity of Catherine Blake as printer of <hi rend="i">America</hi> Copy Q as well as <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> Copy L is demonstrated in Joseph Viscomi’s “Posthumous Blake: The Roles of Catherine Blake, C. H. Tatham, and Frederick Tatham in Blake’s Afterlife” (<hi rend="i">Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly</hi>, vol. 53. no. 3, Fall 2019).<lb/>

                    <illusobjdesc>The design embodies the destructiveness of warfare.  In the middle distance is a
stone wall with, on the right, the
fragments of a top carved with classical motifs.  A great gap
appears to the left, and in this gap sits a giant winged figure. 
 He is nude and muscular, with prominent knees and feet and both
arms shackled and chained to the ground or to remnants of the wall on which he
squats or sits.  His legs are drawn up in an extremely contracted
posture, with his knees to his shoulders.  His head is lowered and
rests on his knees; his face is not pictured.  His hair is long and
curly.  The contracted posture and lowered head suggest despair. He may be Albion's Angel, the representative of the establishment forces, or Orc, the personification of revolution. To the right
is a family group, all nude.  A woman, very probably a mother,
sits on a fragment of the stone wall.  Her hair is long and her
face expresses a brooding fear, despair, or simply exhaustion. 
She holds in her lap a young child, probably male.  He
faces forward, and his
(right?) knee is prominent.  Another child, of uncertain gender,
leans against the woman's left thigh and hip and hides his or her
head below the woman's left arm.  This figure's legs are crossed
at the ankles.  We see this figure from behind.  On the ground
on the far left is a dismounted cannon.  The sky is dominated by dark
clouds, perhaps of smoke.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The design is framed by a dark, rippling border, perhaps suggesting cloud or water forms.  To the left of the imprint hovers a faint shadow. Above the imprint are male
corpses stacked like cord wood.  We see, on the first level of
the stack, the tops of the heads and horizontally-extended arms
of two rigid bodies lying prone.  The next layer is a single
rigid body, lying supine, with his legs extended to the right and
his arms at his side.  He faces up. His feet are bare.  Above him is a gowned woman
with long hair, lying on top of him with her left leg drawn up
and her right leg extended.  She embraces the man around his head
with her left arm.  Her face, seen in profile, touches the dead
or dying man's face below her; she may be kissing him, trying to
resuscitate him, or simply mourning over him.  Her mouth is partly open.  The dark sky above
these figures contains a few diagonal lines that may
indicate rain or sleet descending from the clouds above.  These
large clouds bear the title, as though inscribed upon them, and
six figures.  On the left, a gowned woman with long hair sits
with right leg extended before her and her left leg bent back
behind her.  She faces and hunches over to the left, apparently
holding a book or tablet before which stands a gowned
child, probably male, with curly hair.  His right arm is extended over the book or tablet, and he looks down at it.  Behind the woman is another
figure, perhaps nude and female, sitting with legs extended and
her back leaning against the back of the woman.  Although the
scale of the figures is uncertain, this may be a child or young
girl.  Another group of three figures is on the right.  An old,
bearded man with long hair sits facing to the right.  He wears a
heavy gown and hunches over a book or tablet on his lap, at which
he appears to be looking and perhaps reading.  His posture is
contracted, in contrast to the figure to the right—a nude female
hovering in the air.  We see her from behind; her posture is
gracefully twisted.  Her left arm is raised horizontally, her
right arm at 135 degrees.  The index finger on her right hand
points upward.  Her right leg is extended, her left drawn up.  Her hair is
in a bun.  Behind the old man is a nude male, youthful and facing
to the right although his body is turned to the left and leans
against the back of the old man.  His legs are crossed and he
points upward and to the left with his right arm, hand, and
extended index finger at an angle of 135 degrees.  His left arm
is at his side.  Although these
two nude figures are much smaller than the old man, they are
probably not children but energetic representations of spiritual
states unperceived, or ignored, by the old man.  The two large
figures with books or tablets have sometimes been identified as a
sibyl and a prophet.  Alternatively, the male may be a
priest.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Although the plate contains considerable text, it
appears as though the plate is treated as a single design
extending across the top one third, down the left margin, and
across the lower margin.  A large tree, perhaps an oak, with
arching branches dominates the top left of the design.  The
vegetation right and left of the large trunk may be separate
bushes.  Below and to the right of its trunk is an
earthen bank (possibly covered with grass or moss) to which is shackled a
nude, youthful male by both hands and feet.  His arms are spread
out horizontally on the rock, as if crucified; his legs are also
spread apart.  His torso and neck are twisted, perhaps in pain;
he faces up.  His mouth is open; he may be speaking or crying in
pain.  His hair is curly; he is probably Orc, the spirit of
revolution here restrained.  To the right are a nude male and
female, both standing.  The female, with legs spread apart,
grasps her head with both hands, as if in mourning or despair. 
We do not see her face, but her upper torso is twisted to the
left—toward the shackled youth.  She may be Enitharmon, Orc's
mother.  Further to the right, the male stands with legs spread
apart.  His body faces us, but he turns his head to the left and
may be looking at the shackled youth.  His arms, with elbows
bent, are raised over his head, with his hands raised, palms out,
and the fingers of both hands spread apart.  His hair is spiky or
flame-like.  His mouth may be slightly open; he may be speaking or crying out in
sorrow.  This may be Los, Orc's father.  Alternatively, the
couple has been identified as Adam and Eve, or as the "Dark
virgin" and Urthona (another name for Los) mentioned on this
plate (lines 12, 2).  The roots of the tree descend through the left
margin, perhaps taking on anthropomorphic shapes.  At the end of
the roots, in the far lower left corner of the plate, sits or
squats a nude, youthful male in a severely contracted posture. 
His legs are drawn up, with his head resting on his knees.  He
faces forward, with a grim expression, and holds his crossed
hands over his ankles.  His hair is curly or flame-like.  This
may be another representation of Orc, as the personification of
underground forces of revolution now enclosed but with the
potential to break out.  A reticulated worm, with six loops,
fills the lower margin.  The loops suggest (although they do not
quite form) a spiral.</illusobjdesc>

grasps her head with both hands, as if in mourning or despair. 
We do not see her face, but her upper torso is twisted to the

mother, but she has also been identified as Eve or as the "Dark virgin"
named on the plate (line 12).</illusobjdesc>

his arms, bent sharply at the elbows, seem to be pushing him
upward.  He looks up and to the right.  This is probably Orc.  To
the left are a good many roots, as though we could see below the
surface of the earth.  Above these roots is a large plant growing
up the left margin.  It bears two large leaves and a long branch
that terminates in a grain tassel.  To the left of the main trunk or stem is a vine-like branch that spirals upward with one loop around the main stem.  There are a few small
plants and tufts of grass right of the nude male and left and
right of the large plant.  A dark, uneven border surrounds the illustration and text.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The area above the text bearing the heading ("A /
PROPHECY," lines 2-3) apparently represents the sky with cloud outlines added in grey wash.  Six birds fly on
extended wings; three of these seem to be soaring upwards.  Upper
left, a nude, muscular male also seems to be ascending.  He has
apparently broken free of the chains that still dangle from his
wrists.  His right arm is at his side; his left arm is bent back
over his left shoulder.  His left leg is bent behind him; we see
only the left ankle and foot.  His hair may be curly.  He faces
forward, with head tilted up.  This may be another representation of Orc or,
more generally, humanity freed from its chains by revolution. 
The words of the heading are integrated into vegetative design
motifs, including several vines with leaves, spiraling vines
growing from the first and last letters of "PROPHECY" (line 3), and grain
stems and tassels growing from the first word of the heading
("A," line 2).</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Between lines 8 and 9 of the text, a hovering nude
male, perhaps an apocalyptic angel of the last trump, blows into a large trumpet he holds with at least his left hand.  We see him from
behind; his hair is long and streams to the left, as though blown
by a wind.  Issuing from the mouth of the trumpet is a great
blast of fire that turns upward in the left margin of the plate. 
Below, and evidently part of the same design, are further flames and smoke,
including a line of fire between lines 15 and 17 of the text.  In
the lower left corner of the plate is a nude family group fleeing
from the fires above and behind them.  The male (father?) is in
the middle; he holds the hand of a young boy on the left.  He strides forward with his left
leg and looks back at the flames.  His hair may be curly.  The
woman (mother?) strides forward with her right leg, also turns back to the
flames, and raises her left arm over her head.  The fingers of
her left hand are spread apart.  The boy on the left strides
forward with his left leg, also seems to be looking back, and
raises his right arm over his head.  All three figures stride
over a small mound of earth or hill.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Although the plate contains considerable text, it
would appear that the pictorial image is treated as a full-plate
design.  At top right, just below line 2, is a
winged dragon of a type traditionally called a wyvern.  The
creature is apparently flying through the air.  It faces to the
left, with a coiled or spiral tail with one loop on the right. 
Its skin looks scaly and its face is somewhat dog-like, with a
partly opened mouth and large teeth.  The top of its head bears a
crest.  Its front paws look almost like human hands.  Below and
to the left of its left paw is a jagged line, perhaps
representing a bolt of lightning.  Further to the left, and
descending into the left margin, is an old man.  His gown forms a
long, snake-like tail behind him, rather like the wyvern's tail. 
He has a long beard and long hair.  His right arm is at his side,
but we can see that, with his right hand, he grasps a large book
or tablet.  His left arm reaches downward and he holds in his
left hand a scepter or spear with a fleur-de-lis point.  This
figure may be Albion's Angel or Urizen (twice referred to in the
text) with his book of laws.  Below this descending figure is
another jagged line, perhaps representing lightning, and several
cloud outlines extending to the right margin above and below the last two lines of text.  Below these billowing clouds, in the plate's lower
margin, is a landscape that includes three figures, probably a
family group of father, mother, and child.  Lower left is the
trunk of a large tree, fallen on the ground to the left.  On the
right, behind the figure group, is another fallen tree with three limbs near the right margin.  The
male is the left-most figure in the group, lower right.  He is
nude and squats or kneels on the ground, with his upper body bent
forward.  Both arms are raised and bent at the elbows; he grasps
his head with both hands.  This gesture expresses despair or terror.  To the right is a crouching nude figure.  The heavy musculature suggests a male, but this may be a female.  Her left knee and foot are
prominent.  She turns her head to the right; we cannot see her
face because it is covered by the head of a child of uncertain
gender she embraces.  This child is standing and is gowned.  These two figures seem to be
seeking protection in each other's arms.</illusobjdesc>

His left arm reaches downward and he holds in his left hand a

Albion's Angel or Urizen (twice referred to in the text) with his

                    <illusobjdesc>Although containing considerable text, the plate is
treated as a full-plate design with six nude figures.  Top left is a man hovering horizontally in the air in
front of a cloud.  His left leg extends back and up behind him;
his left arm extends out to the right and he points in that
direction with his left index finger.  In his right hand he holds
large scales (or, more precisely, a pair of balances), perhaps to
be associated with the Day of Judgment.  This figure may be a
personification of Justice.  He has long hair and looks up and to
the right at the pair of figures to his right.  The lower man in
this pair seems to be standing, with one leg bent and one
extended, on the outline of the cloud.  He is bent over, with his
face hidden.  His hair is curly.  With both arms bent at the
elbows and extended over his head he carries on his back another
nude male.  This figure, in an extremely contracted posture, has
his arms tied with rope behind his back, both legs drawn up, and his
head and upper body bent over so that his head seems to touch his
groin or left thigh.  Perhaps we are to think that the man
holding this figure is about to cast him into the abyss.  Further
to the right, but still above the text area, is another nude
figure with long hair that forms loops, but also hair pulled back into a bun.  This coiffure suggests that, in spite of the heavy musculature, this figure may be female.  We see her from
behind, floating vertically in the air, with legs slightly
spread.  Her left arm is raised, her right is lowered, but she
grasps with both hands a giant sword with flames emanating from
its edge and trailing off to the right, as though blown by a
wind.  The arm position suggests that she may be sheathing the
sword, although no sheath is clearly pictured.  This figure,
perhaps another personification of Justice, looks to the right. 
Below the text are large tongues of flame, perhaps suggesting
hell.  Just above or within these fires are two more nude males.  The
figure on the left hovers horizontally in the air, although he
may be falling into the flames below.  His hair is curly.  His
knees are drawn up toward his torso and he grasps the back of his
head with both hands and faces down.  This gesture suggests
despair.  To the right is a male falling head-first.  His knees
are sharply bent and he too seems to grasp his head with both
hands.  Around him circles a giant snake, with open mouth and a
forked tongue.  Below the human figure, the snake's tail forms a
spiral into which the man may be falling.  The skin of the snake
is scaly.</illusobjdesc>

figure, with long hair that forms loops, but also hair pulled back into a bun.  This coiffure suggests that, in spite of the heavy musculature, this figure may be female.  We see her from
behind, hovering vertically in the air, with legs slightly
spread.  Her left arm is raised, her right is lowered, but she
grasps with both hands a giant sword with flames emanating from
its edge and trailing off to the right, as though blown by a
wind.  The arm position suggests that she may be sheathing the
sword, although no sheath is clearly pictured.  This figure,
perhaps another personification of Justice, looks to the
right.</illusobjdesc>

His legs are bent at the knees, with thighs spread apart (clearly
revealing his genitals) and his feet below the center of his
body.  His arms are behind him, apparently with hands resting on
the ground for support (we see only his right hand on the
ground).  His hair is curly.  His body is slightly twisted as he
faces up and to the right.  He may be in the act of rising from
the ground.  Behind are clouds.  The earth below may be a small
hill or mound covered with grass or moss.  Below his right foot and on the right are several
leaves, perhaps oak or grape leaves.  A vine-like plant with leaves and
perhaps flowers decorates the right side of the mound and
descends into the right margin of the text.  On the
left is a skull, facing skyward.  This motif suggests that the
male may be sitting on a grave—perhaps his own, from which he is
rising.  Far left are a few tufts of grass and another vine
dangling down the left margin of the text; it bears large leaves
(perhaps grape).</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Although the plate contains seven lines of text, the
pictorial image is treated as a full-plate design.  The landscape
below the text includes, on the left, a large tree, perhaps a
birch or willow, growing up the left margin.  Its long, slender
branches and leaves (or perhaps catkins) arch over the text.  Two birds with long, forked tails are perched on the
branches of the tree (the remnants of a third bird, etched on the plate, appear to the right of the lower perching bird).  Three birds fly in the sky, one upper left among the branches; two much smaller birds fly above "voice" and "Then" in the first line of text.  A winged insect, perhaps a moth or butterfly, flies left of the upper perching bird.  The landscape below includes
grass and two large leaves.  The leaf on the left, near the tree,
has a vine-like stem; this may be a grape vine.  The leaf in the
lower right corner might be either a grape or oak leaf.  Lying on
the grass is a ram, facing right, apparently asleep.  A young boy
or male child rests his arms and head on the ram's back; his feet
(or at least one foot) can be seen right of the ram's head.  This boy has curly hair and
is probably also sleeping.  Below the ram, another youth, but of
uncertain gender, is stretched on the grass, perhaps asleep.  We
see this nude figure from behind.  The figure's left leg is
extended, the right bent at the knee.  The figure's head lies on
his or her right arm; we see only the top of the figure's head
and long hair.  What may be beams of light extend upward to the branches above the text.  This gentle, pastoral scene
contrasts sharply
with the apocalyptic tone of the text on the plate.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Although the plate contains a good deal of text,
Blake treated the pictorial image as a full-plate design.  Above,
an old, bearded, and gowned man sits among clouds.  His long hair
cascades over his left shoulder.  He faces forward, but looks
slightly to the left.  His arms are raised horizontally; his
hands seem to be holding the clouds on which they rest, palms down.  His
right leg is drawn up toward his chest in a contracted posture;
the right knee and foot are prominent.  His left leg is not
pictured.  The lines below his right foot may be a fold of his garment, but possibly a sandal.  This figure is very probably Urizen.  At the bottom of
the plate is a dark and stormy sea with waves.  The text panel is
shaped in such a way as to suggest a cloud between the upper and
lower parts of the design, or possibly a break between clouds.  The design, particularly the figure,
offers a contrasting parallel to the design on plate

His long hair cascades over his left shoulder.  He faces forward,
but looks slightly to the left.  His arms are raised
horizontally; his hands seem to be holding the clouds on which
they rest, palms down.  The visible fingers on his hands are spread apart.  His right leg is drawn up toward his chest in a
contracted posture; the right knee and foot are prominent.  His
left leg is not pictured.  The lines below his right foot may be a fold of his garment, but possibly a sandal.  This is probably Urizen.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Although the plate contains considerable text, the
pictorial image is treated as a full page design.  Given the presence of
stars and a crescent moon, this is a night scene.  The sky is filled
with clouds and the text panel is also shaped like a cloud.  High in the
sky, but below the first three lines of text, a giant swan flies on
extended wings to the right.  A youthful nude male rides on his back.
The figure's legs are spread apart and dangle on each side of the swan's
back just in front of its wings.  The youth's hair is blown to the left by the onward flight of the bird.  The man
looks back to the left, away from the direction of flight, and braces
himself with his right arm.  His left arm is raised horizontally and he
holds in his left hand a rein attached to the swan's beak. This figure
has sometimes been identified as Boston's Angel, although the reason for
this may be nothing more than the fact that he is named in the text
immediately above the figure.  To the right of the swan are four much
smaller birds, all flying on extended wings.  The largest of these has a
forked tail.  Below, and to the left of the text panel, are eight(?) stars; 
the upper seven of these may be a constellation, the Pleiades.  
One more star appears in the sky below the text near the crescent moon. It might be the planet Venus.  
Also below the text, but still in the night sky, are two more flying birds.  The
earth appears only along the lower margin;  a small plant grows from the lower right corner.  Three nude children
ride on the back of a snake.  The front-most child, perhaps a girl with
long hair, holds a pair of reins in her left hand that extends to the
snake's open mouth.  Its forked tongue is prominent and at least one
horn extends back from its head.  The second child, further to the left,
appears to be a male with curly hair.  He braces himself with his left arm, perhaps
holding on to the snake with his left hand, and reaches back with his
right arm to hold hands with the very young child or infant nearest the
snake's tail.  This child reaches up, perhaps with both hands, but faces
to the right and may be looking down.  The right-most child has her legs
together; the others have their legs spread on each side of the snake
(although we see only their right legs).  The snake's body forms a loop
left of the children and terminates in two more loops and a single tail
(two were eliminated in this, the second state of the
plate).</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Although containing considerable text, the plate is
treated as a full-page design.  Lower left, an old man enters a
tomb.  The post and lintel doorway, very probably built of
stones, makes the tomb look like the entrance to a mine shaft.
The heavy wooden door is partly open, revealing within darkness.  The old, bearded man wears a heavy gown; his prominent
left foot can be seen under the hem.  He faces, and is probably
walking, to the left—into the tomb.  He is bent over and leans
on a crutch held in his left hand and propped beneath his left
armpit.  His hair appears to be blown by a wind from right to
left, and hence towards the tomb entrance.  To the right of the
tomb is the trunk of a massive tree with a root extending along
the ground to the right.  The tree apparently continues behind
the tomb and then grows above it, where we see more of the trunk and two or three branches with a few leaves.  Behind and to the right of the lower
trunk of the tree is a form that is probably another tree trunk.  Further to the right below the text
is a dark background with white lines suggesting clouds. In other copies, a landscape below the clouds shows hills or distant mountains, perhaps covered with trees.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Although the plate contains considerable text, the pictorial image is treated as a full-page design showing the surface and bottom of the sea.  Above the text, the limp body of a nude female lies supine on a stony shore, with her legs on the right extending into the waves of the sea.  Her head is bent back and her long hair descends below, as does her dangling right arm.  She is probably dead, perhaps from drowning.  Some spiky vegetation grows left of her head.  A large bird, very probably an eagle, is perched on her right upper leg.  The eagle's wings are extended and his curved beak hovers above the woman's abdomen.  The bird may be eating (or about to eat) the corpse.  The sky behind the bird is filled with clouds; both the sky and the sea on the right (perhaps the Atlantic, named several times in the text) are stormy.  Below the text we see the dark waters of the deep and the bottom of the sea.  Upon it lies supine a nude male, with his knees bent slightly and his left arm at his side.  His body is emaciated and rigid; he is no doubt dead, probably from drowning.  We can see his ribs; perhaps the sea creatures around him have been eating his flesh.  These include one large fish and two small ones, all with their mouths open.  A sea snake coils itself around the man's legs; another snake hovers above his chest.  Five much smaller fish appear immediately below the text and in the right margin following the final two lines of text.  Below the man, on the floor of the sea, are two further sea snakes or worms and, below his knees, a creature of some sort that is difficult to identify-perhaps a sea anemone or tube worm with tentacles extending to the left.  Near the lower right corner is a large, spiral shell, probably a whelk (common to the Atlantic).  There are two other, much smaller shells, one below the man's neck and one in the far lower right corner of the plate (clearer in other copies).  Vegetation rises in the left margin of the text almost touching the female figure on the rocky shore.  This vegetation may be seaweed.  The twisted, loopy lines include, left of lines 6-9 of the text, a snake with open mouth.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Most of the design appears between lines 10 and 11 of
the text, but the roots of the large tree descend to the lower
margin and its branches extend to the top.  Thus, one must view
the entire plate to see all elements of the design.  Under the
arching and leafless branches of this tree sits a figure,
probably female.  Immediately behind her may be the trunk of a
second large tree.  She is nude except for a long scarf she wears
over her head; it trails on the ground to the right.  Her legs
are spread apart and bent at the knees, with her lower legs and
feet drawn up near her thighs.  She looks to the left toward the
second figure in the design.  Her left arm is braced next to her
torso, with the left hand on the ground.  Her right arm is extended horizontally, 
with the palm of her right hand facing down and her fingers (except for her downward-pointing thumb) pointing towards the other figure.  She may be a
sibyl or priestess.  Between her legs is a coiled snake, with its
head also directed at the second figure.  The snake's mouth is
open and its forked tongue is prominent.  To the left is a young
male with curly hair.  He may wear a short gown or tights. 
He is seated on the ground, with his legs extended to the left
and his upper body raised and twisted so that he faces right and
looks toward the other figure.  His hands are together in an
attitude of prayer or supplication.  His elbows are propped on a
stack of two large books (or a tablet and a book on top).  He may be a student or acolyte of the
priestess.  The sky behind the figures is filled with clouds.</illusobjdesc>

spread appears to be hovering in the flames or rising through

sits or squats, facing right but with her head lowered.  She has
long hair that covers her face; her arm position is uncertain.  In her lap
lies another nude female embracing the seated figure around her
waist with her left arm, raised horizontally.  Her body is
twisted and her face is also hidden.  The right-most figure in
the group is kneeling and facing forward with her body twisted; her face is covered by her long hair.  Her left arm is extended horizontally.  To the right
of this group is another nude female in an extremely contracted
posture, facing left.  Her legs are drawn up with her knees to
her chest.  Her upper body leans forward over her raised knees
and her left arm partly encircles her lowered head and long hair.

females is a large grape leaf, a spiraling grape vine, and a
large cluster of grapes.  Above the group of three is another

                <illustration type="interlinear" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>The text includes, between its lines and in the
right margin, a great many interlinear motifs.  Most of these
take the form of vines or other vegetation; only the most
significant of these will be recorded here.  Above the second
word ("Albions") in line 2, a bird flies upward on extended
wings.  The first letter of the first word in line 3 grows into a
vine, perhaps with leaves.  Line 4 ("Bristols") is preceded by a
horse running or leaping to the left.  Following "Bristols" are
the following, reading left to right: a vine with a standing
figure facing left, perhaps looking at a very small figure
looking right with arms raised horizontally; a vine with a seated
figure facing right; a flock of birds; a vine with perhaps a dog
standing on it, facing left (and barking at the birds?); a vine
with a standing figure facing left with at least one arm raised
horizontally; a small bird and a large bird (an eagle?) flying
upward; a tree trunk with one bare branch; a figure striding to
the left, at least one arm raised vertically, holding something
(perhaps a child?) in his or her raised hand.  Two birds fly on extended wings above "And cast" in line 8.  Following the word
"mail" (line 7) is another series of very small motifs.  These are,
from left to right: a leafless tree; a minimally representational
form that may be a figure sitting on the ground with one arm
propping up the upper body; two figures facing each other,
perhaps coming together to embrace or to fight; a vine with one
leaf; a vine with two loops and one leaf; a vine-like form with a
figure above it, striding and facing to the left with at least
one arm raised horizontally; a vine bearing, and arching over, a
figure lying on it and facing left.  Following line 9 is a vine,
growing from the second letter of "chattering" in line 10,
and a hovering figure, with legs spread, facing to the left and
holding to his or her mouth (and thus playing?) a trumpet or horn
of some sort.  A vine with two loops extends to the left from the
first letter of "hills" (line 13).  At the end of line 13, a
twisting vine appears above the final word ("sky").  A tassel of
grain grows from the final letter of "sky."  Between lines 13 and
14 are several motifs.  From left to right these are a vine with
two loops growing from the first letter of "The" at the beginning
of line 14; a very small figure striding to the right, with at
least one arm raised horizontally, on top of the first letter of
the first word in line 14; two vines, one with two loops; a small
bird flying; a seated human figure with knees bent, at least one
arm raised horizontally, and facing to the left; a vine with
leaves growing from the "d" of "winds" in line 14; a vine or
grain tassel growing from the first letter of "driven" in line
14; and a bird flying on extended wings above "flames" in line
14.  A vine, with flowers or leaves, descends from the last
letter of "scales," line 22 of the text.  Birds fly on extended
wing above "spirits" and "dead pining," line 26 of the text. 
Above "bonds of" in the same line, a stag runs or leaps to the
left.  A bird—or perhaps a moth—flies at the end of the
line.  A vine-like form with one loop connects the last letters of lines 25 and 29.</illusobjdesc>

over her legs.  Her head faces down; her face is covered by her right
arm, bent at the elbow with the upper arm raised.  Apparently, her hands
are together in an attitude of prayer or supplication.  Her long hair
cascades below her right elbow and down the right margin of the text,
perhaps transformed into a waterfall (as is strongly suggested by blue coloring in other copies).  Despair and crying are suggested by the
figure; perhaps we are to think of the waterfall as her tears.  The
figure has been variously identified as a personification of Earth
(given the presence of other figures on her body) and even as Urizen, in
spite of the apparent gender.  Seven figures stand or sit on the giant's
body.  On her head is a gowned and seated figure, facing right and
holding (and apparently reading) a book or tablet.  On her back are two
figures, one standing and facing right.  This apparently gowned figure
holds a book or tablet in her or his right hand.  Just to the right is a
kneeling figure, with one leg extended back, and the right arm raised at
135 degrees.  This figure may be looking up and supplicating or praying.
Below these two figures, and standing on the giant figure's right upper
thigh, is a tree with branches and possibly a few leaves.  Standing and
leaning against this tree is a (probably male) figure facing to the
right.  He wears a broad-brimmed hat and holds and plays a pipe.  Below the piper, on the giant's calf, is a small form that may be a seated figure.  Just to the left of the giant's right foot is an embracing couple.  The figure most likely to be the female in this group is seated and seen from behind with at least one leg bent slightly at the knee.  The man, also apparently nude, half lies and half kneels on the
ground, facing right, with his right arm extended at 45 degrees to embrace the woman rather limply.  To the right of this couple, and standing on
the ground just beneath the giant's lower leg, a stag runs or leaps to
the right.  The left portion of this design above the text is a forest
of at least four leafless trees.  Their trunks have anthropomorphic
forms.  We can also
see some of their roots near the left margin; one such root extends left of
the first nine lines of text in the left margin.  The ground in both the left and right margins descends over cliffs.</illusobjdesc>
