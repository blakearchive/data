His feet are submerged in the River Jordan with his left foot raised on tiptoe.  The river flows into the Dead Sea behind Christ.  Mountains rise above the water in the distance.  Christ's arms are down at his sides with the palms turned out to face the viewer.  A halo of rosy light radiates from Christ's head; his eyes are raised and he looks toward Heaven.  John the Baptist stands to the left of Christ.  He is seen from behind with his head turned up and to the right.  He wears a belted gown or tunic of animal skins covered in long fur.  In his right hand John holds a goblet or pitcher containing the water with which he baptizes Christ.  Satan flies above and to the right of Christ; he may be fleeing.  He is nude and is seen from behind with his head turned in profile to the right.  A serpent flies or hovers near Satan; its tail ends in a single loop below Satan's left foot while its neck and head—also forming a single loop—appears below Satans's right arm.  A gowned female stands to the left of John.  She faces right and holds an infant in front of her chest with both hands.  The infant holds his hands together in prayer.  Below, a male child stands facing right with his arms raised vertically and his head bent back.  A gowned female stands to the right of Christ with her arms bent upward.  Her eyes are raised and she may look at Satan, above.  To the right, a gowned male with a long beard stands with his hands held together in prayer.  Below, a gowned female(?) child stands facing left with her arms raised vertically.  The sky above Christ's head is filled with radiant light.  A column of smoke or dark clouds appears to the left of the light, above John's head.  Two lightning bolts also appear in the sky, one to either side of the light.  The dove of the Holy Ghost descends on outstretched wings above Christ's head.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>Christ</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>eyes raised</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>halo</characteristic><characteristic>light</characteristic><characteristic>radiance</characteristic><characteristic>cloth</characteristic><characteristic>loincloth</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>arms at side</characteristic><characteristic>palms facing viewer</characteristic><characteristic>fingers spread</characteristic><characteristic>tiptoe</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Christ stands in the center of the design facing forward.

His arms are bent upward with his palms turned out (away from the viewer) and fingers slightly spread.  The figure to the right faces forward with his head turned slightly to the right.  He is bearded and has long, curly hair.  His arms are held at his side with his palms facing downward and fingers slightly spread.  Two gowned and winged angels fly or hover to the left and right of Andrew and Simon Peter.  A halo of radiance with beams of light surrounds each angel's head.  The angel to the left holds its hands in front of its chest with the palms facing the viewer.  The angel to the right holds his hands together in prayer.  The ground below the figures is covered with grass.  A small plant appears in the lower left corner of the design.  The plant appears to have several branches and at least four flower buds or fruits.  There is also an indication of vine-like tendrils extending from the plant.  A walled city—probably Jericho—appears in the distance behind the figures.  Three structures rise above the wall: a rectangular or circular tower appears below the leftmost angel's feet; a triangular structure, possibly a pyramid, is seen between Andrew and Simon Peter; a domed structure appears below the rightmost angel's feet.  These may be buildings or the roofs of buildings within the city.  Two pairs of palm trees with arching branches grow right and left.  Washes in the background indicate a sky at sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="AC"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>Andrew</characteristic><characteristic>Simon Peter</characteristic><characteristic>seen from behind</characteristic><characteristic>facing away</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>facing up</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>short hair</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>halo</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent</characteristic><characteristic>right foot</characteristic><characteristic>arms bent</characteristic><characteristic>arms bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>palms out</characteristic><characteristic>hands raised, palms out</characteristic><characteristic>fingers spread</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Two gowned males, Andrew and Simon Peter, stand in the center of the design.

His body faces forward, but his head is turned to the right, away from the other figures in the scene.  His arms are bent and extend to the left with the palms held vertically.  Satan—disguised as an old, bearded man—flies or hovers above the scene.  He is upside down with his arms raised horizontally across the design.  Satan holds a crown in his left hand.  He is surrounded by spiky flames.  Three erotic female figures dance to the left of Christ.  The central figure is seen from behind and looks to the right towards Christ.  She is gowned and her back and arms are covered in scales.  The other two figures are nude and face forward with their arms linked in an arch above their heads.  The left hand of the figure on the left can be seen holding the waist of the female on the right.  All three figures stand on tiptoe and bend or arch to the left.  Two ornate, divan-like couches appear behind Christ and the dancing figures.  The couches are topped with cushions or pillows, and the bases are decorated with a pattern of leaves and flower buds or small fruit.  A large banquet table extends to the left and right margins of the design above the couches.  On the table are two lit candles in large candle sticks (far right and far left), a cup, three small plates, and two larger bowls or platters.  The platter just to the left of Christ may contain food.  In the central background, two nude female figures sit or recline on a pair of couches.  Three pairs of winged angels fly or hover above the table in the background; the left and rightmost pairs are positioned above the candles and are rather minimally represented, particularly far right.  The central pair appears just above the reclining figures.  The central pair is more distinct than the others; the angels face each other in profile and may be praying.  The scene is flanked by two leafy trees, each with a small sliver of their trunks visible along the left and right borders of the design.  The ground below Christ and the dancing figures is covered in grass.  Coloring at the top of the design indicates sky.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="BD"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>Christ</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>halo</characteristic><characteristic>light</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>feet</characteristic><characteristic>arms extended</characteristic><characteristic>arms bent</characteristic><characteristic>palms vertical</characteristic><characteristic>palm out</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Christ stands in the right half of the design.
