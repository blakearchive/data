    The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of thirty-three of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible.  All take their subjects from the New Testament and have been added to the twenty Old Testament subjects published in March 2010 as “Illustrations to the Bible, c. 1780-1824,” under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.  This new group is presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).
                <lb/><lb/>
                   Blake executed most of these New Testament water colors c. 1800-05 for his patron Thomas Butts.  The exceptions are <hi rend="i">The Whore of Babylon</hi> of 1809 and <hi rend="i">The Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins</hi> in the Yale Center for British Art, datable to c. 1825. The subjects range from the childhood of Jesus to his ascension, the later history of his parents and one of his major followers, St. Paul, and a group of eight designs based on the Book of Revelation.  While the illustrations of the life of Christ are fairly conventional in their subjects, in part because of the long tradition of picturing almost every event in the Gospels, individual motifs recall designs in Blake’s illuminated books and thus offer a window on Blake’s visual interpretation of the Bible. The illustrations of Revelation complement Blake’s intense engagement with apocalyptic events and images in his own poetry.
                    <lb/><lb/>
                        The selection of fifty-three biblical water colors now available in the Archive will be supplemented in the future with early works, such as <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>, datable to c. 1780, and will continue through Blake’s final biblical water colors, such as <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi>. 
                    <lb/><lb/>

At the bottom center of the design is a partly-supine Jesus, nude except for a piece of cloth, likely his unwrapped shroud, that drapes across his genitals. He faces forward, but turns his head in profile to look up and left. His legs are crossed at the ankle with his arms are at his sides. His left hand rests on the floor, palm facing up while his right hand, palm down, appears to hold the unwrapped shroud. Stigmata is visible on both hands, the left side of his chest, and the left foot. He has long, flame-like hair and a curly beard and his mouth is open. Jesus may emanate a halo-like aura. 
  Winged and gowned male angels with short, curly hair stand either side of Jesus. The angel on the left faces right in profile and down, looking at Jesus. His right arm is raised at 45 degrees, with the right hand holding Jesus's shroud. The angel's left arm is bent upward at the elbow to hold an end of Jesus's shroud. The angel on the right of Jesus looks left in profile and down. His arm is at his side and his left foot is visible beneath the hem of his gown.       
  Dominating the center of the design is the figure of a gowned and winged male angel with short, curly hair, facing away. His right leg is extended backward, bent, and on tiptoe, perhaps indicating that he is walking. His arms are raised horizontally and he is holding or removing the rectangular stone in front of him. The scene takes place in a dark tomb, with a stone floor, wall and a step leading to an arched doorway. Beneath Jesus's upper-left forearm and elbow is diamond-patterned area that may represent a reed mat or bier. The sky visible through the doorway appears to be dark and cloudy, suggesting that it is night. Dark shadows in the distance, left of the angel's upper left arm, may be leafy trees.
