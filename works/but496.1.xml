    The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of thirty-three of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible.  All take their subjects from the New Testament and have been added to the twenty Old Testament subjects published in March 2010 as “Illustrations to the Bible, c. 1780-1824,” under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.  This new group is presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).
                <lb/><lb/>
                   Blake executed most of these New Testament water colors c. 1800-05 for his patron Thomas Butts.  The exceptions are <hi rend="i">The Whore of Babylon</hi> of 1809 and <hi rend="i">The Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins</hi> in the Yale Center for British Art, datable to c. 1825. The subjects range from the childhood of Jesus to his ascension, the later history of his parents and one of his major followers, St. Paul, and a group of eight designs based on the Book of Revelation.  While the illustrations of the life of Christ are fairly conventional in their subjects, in part because of the long tradition of picturing almost every event in the Gospels, individual motifs recall designs in Blake’s illuminated books and thus offer a window on Blake’s visual interpretation of the Bible. The illustrations of Revelation complement Blake’s intense engagement with apocalyptic events and images in his own poetry.
                    <lb/><lb/>
                        The selection of fifty-three biblical water colors now available in the Archive will be supplemented in the future with early works, such as <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>, datable to c. 1780, and will continue through Blake’s final biblical water colors, such as <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi>. 
                    <lb/><lb/>
                    As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with the University of Rochester, the continuing support of the Library of Congress, and the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.

In the center lies Christ, nearly nude except for a loincloth and crown of thorns. He faces forward and slightly up, with his head turned to look left. His arms are raised horizontally, palms up, and his legs dangle. He has long, curly hair and a beard, and a halo-like aura surrounds his head. Jesus lies on a wooden cross that leans against a large boulder or hillside. Three nails or spikes lie on the rock near the cross, two below his right arm and one below and to the right of his left hand. To the left of Jesus's legs kneels a group of five figures. The leftmost figure appears to be that of a female with long, curly hair and a veil covering part of her hair. She faces forward and slightly left, looking up with her mouth open. She may be crying. The second-to-left figure is that of a male with short, curly hair. He wears a gown and faces forward and to the right, looking up at Jesus. His mouth is partly open. His arms are bent with his palms held vertical, fingers slightly spread. The middle figure of this group faces right, slightly away, and bending down, as though bowing. This figure is of indeterminable gender, but wears a gown. The second-to-right figure is also of indeterminable gender and faces right, slightly away, and bowing down, wearing a gown. The rightmost figure is that of a female with long hair and a gown, facing right and down. Her arms are bent upward with her hands presumably on her face. Her legs are bent underneath her. She too is bowing, possibly praying or lamenting. To the right of Jesus's legs is a group of five gowned figures. The leftmost figure kneels, facing left and down. This figure is of indeterminable gender, but has slightly curly hair. The figure's legs are bent underneath it and its arms are bent upward, with its hands to its face. The figure may be praying or lamenting. The second-to-left figure faces left and down. This figure is of indeterminable gender, and covers its head with a hood or veil. The middle figure of this group is of indeterminable gender, and faces left and down. It may be kneeling. It covers its head with a hood or veil. The second-to-right figure may be a female, facing right and slightly down and forward. She covers her hair with a hood or veil and bends her arms up so her hands are on her face, covering her eyes. She may be crying. The rightmost figure may be that of a male with short, curly hair, facing right and down. He wears a hood or veil over part of his hair. To the left of Jesus's head sits, squats, or kneels a male figure facing forward, with his right knee slightly drawn up. He wears a shirt and pants or tights and holds a wooden hammer in his right hand. His right arm is bent and his left arm is raised horizontally, pointing to the right. His mouth is open; he may be speaking. Above Jesus's head sits an old man with a long, curly beard. He wears a gown and a hat. His hat, or a separate head band, and the hem of his garment where, are inscribed with Hebrew letters (see the textual transcription). He is very probably a priest. He faces forward and looks to the left, and may be smiling. His arms are bent, and in his hands he holds a scroll with the letters "INRI" written on it (see the textual transcription). To the right of Jesus's head sits, kneels, or squats a man with short, curly hair and a beard. He wears a gown and holds a wooden hammer in his right hand. His right arm is bent and his left arm appears to be at his side. His left leg is drawn up slightly. He faces forward, but looks to the left. The cross and the priest above it are backed with a large stone or hill, possibly the hill of Calvary. The sky backing this scene is partly cloudy, with a red wash that suggests sunrise or sunset.

Our transcription is tentative.  If we assume an initial י at the right end of the inscription but mostly hidden by the priest's hair, and if we assume that Blake meant the final letter on the left to be ל (lamed), then the inscription could mean "Jehovah Elohim," a name for god in Genesis chapter 2 of the Hebrew Old Testament, translated as "Lord God" in the King James Bible.</note></l><l n="but496.1.wc.01.02" justify="left" indent="20">INRI<space extent="3"/>יה ידכך צוד יונ<note>The letters, "INRI," on the scroll held by the priest above Christ's head are an abbreviation for the Latin inscription "Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudæorum" (Jesus of Nazareth King of the Jews).  According to John 19:19, "Jesus of Nazareth the King of the Jews" was written by Pilate and placed "on the cross" on which Christ was crucified (see also Matthew 27:37, Mark 15:26, and Luke 23:38 for slightly different versions).  The Hebrew letters are written vertically, bottom to top, on the priest's cloak where it falls below his left arm, possibly as an unconventional substitute for the phylactery conventionally worn on the left arm.  Our transcription is tentative; some of the letters are poorly formed and they seem to constitute little more than fragments of words.  It is very difficult to distinguish among several letters in Blake's Hebrew writing, particularly ד (dalet), ו (vav), ך (final kaf), and ר (resh).  The first word, יה (right end of the inscription), is probably "Yah," a name for God.</note></l></lg><vspace extent="8"/><lg justify="left"><l n="but496.1.wc.01.03" justify="left" indent="50">inv</l><l n="but496.1.wc.01.04" justify="left" indent="49">WB</l></lg></phystext></desc></objdesc></bad>
