                The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of electronic editions of Blake's illustrations to works by William Hayley, including his <hi rend="i">Essay on Sculpture</hi>, the broadside ballad <hi rend="i">Little Tom the Sailor</hi>, <hi rend="i">The Triumphs of Temper</hi>, <hi rend="i">The Life and Posthumous Writings of William Cowper</hi>, and <hi rend="i">The Life of George Romney</hi>. We are also republishing Blake’s etched and engraved illustrations to <hi rend="i">Designs to a Series of Ballads, Written by William Hayley</hi> (1802) and Hayley’s <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi> (1805). The designs and engraved texts of both sets of <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi>&#160;illustrations, as well as the new material now being published, are fully searchable.<lb/><lb/>
                In late 1799, William Hayley was seeking an engraver to illustrate his poem <hi rend="i">Essay on Sculpture</hi>. Possibly on the advice of the sculptor John Flaxman, Hayley commissioned Blake to produce three plates. In July 1800, Blake spent much of July working on the final plate, an engraving of Hayley’s deceased son, Thomas, in Hayley’s library in the coastal village of Felpham, West Sussex. During these weeks, Hayley persuaded Blake to relocate from London to Felpham to work on a number of graphic projects.  Disenchanted with his failure to secure commercial engraving work in London, Blake enthusiastically took up Hayley’s offer.<lb/><lb/>                                                
                The works now published and republished include all of Blake’s commercial engravings executed for Hayley during the three-year period Blake and his wife Catherine spent in Felpham. In addition, the Blake Archive is publishing two more engravings Blake worked on for Hayley after the Blakes had returned to London in September 1803. These plates were commissioned to illustrate Hayley’s <hi rend="i">The Life of George Romney</hi> (1809). Only one of these plates, <hi rend="i">Sketch of a Shipwreck after Romney</hi>, was included in the published biography. The other, a portrait engraving of Romney, was rejected and, until very recently, has not been seen since the 1939 Blake exhibition in Philadelphia. <lb/><lb/>

                <lb/><lb/><b>May 2009</b><lb/><lb/>                
            The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of Blake's etchings and engravings of his illustrations to <hi rend="i">Designs to a Series of Ballads, Written by William Hayley</hi> (1802) and to the 1805 edition of Hayley's <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi>. These nineteen plates, all but two of which are based on Blake's own designs, are presented in our Preview mode, which provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (our image annotation program). <lb/><lb/>
            While Blake was resident in Felpham on the Sussex coast, beginning in 1801, his new patron William Hayley began to write a series of ballads to be illustrated by the artist-engraver. These were published in 1802 as quarto numbers, each with a frontispiece, headpiece, and tailpiece by Blake. As the general title page indicates, the poems all deal with "Anecdotes Relating to Animals." In his preface, Hayley states that his plan was to issue one ballad a month "and to complete the whole series in fifteen Numbers." The letterpress text was printed by the Chichester printer Joseph Seagrave; the plates were printed by Blake and his wife Catherine on their own rolling press. Although two book dealers, P. Humphry and R. H. Evans, were selected to sell the ballads, most copies seem to have been sold by Hayley to his friends. Sales were less than brisk and the project ceased after only four ballads were issued. Blake designed and executed twelve plates, including a frontispiece for the general title page and a tailpiece to the preface, both issued with the first ballad. Two further plates were engraved by Blake after designs on antique gems (Plates 5 and 11, the tailpieces to "The Elephant" and "The Lion").<lb/><lb/>
            We are also publishing a closely related work, Blake's five illustrations for the 1805 edition of Hayley's <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi>. In January 1805, Hayley contacted the London bookseller Richard Phillips about publishing a new, octavo edition of the ballads. Blake began to execute engravings for this edition no later than March and completed five plates by June. For this 1805 volume, Hayley added twelve ballads to the four published in 1802. Blake engraved new, smaller plates of his designs for three of the 1802 ballads (Plates 1-3) and both designed and engraved new illustrations for two of the additional ballads (Plates 4-5). Blake and Phillips were to "go equal shares ... in the expense and the profits" (Blake's letter to Hayley of 22 January 1805, Erdman page 763), but it is unlikely that Blake made any profit. Robert Southey's mocking review of Hayley's poems and Blake's illustration to "The Dog" (Plate 1) appeared in the <hi rend="i">Annual Review</hi> for 1805.<lb/><lb/>

A nude male with short, curly hair sits below a tree in the center of the design. The trunk of the tree divides into several branches with sparse leaves visible, particularly above and to the right of the figure. The ground below is likely covered with grass, particularly in the lower right corner of the image. The male figure rests on a stone or mound of earth. This is probably Adam in Eden, shown in the act of naming the animals. A second stone or mound appears to the left of the tree. The figure's eyes are raised and he may look at the eagle above. He faces forward with both legs bent; his left foot may be raised on tiptoe. The figure's left arm is bent with the elbow resting on his left knee; his left palm is turned up with the fingers spread slightly. His right arm is down and he touches the mane of the lion below. The lion lies on the ground and faces right in profile with its head down and possibly resting on its front paws. Its right eye is raised and the lion may look at the figure above. Its mouth is open with the tongue extended; the lion may lick the right foot of the male figure. The lion has a distinct mane of curly fur and its tail extends below. A snake or serpent with a spiky crest on its head appears on the ground below the central male figure. The snake's body faces right with its head turned to the left in profile. Its mouth is open with the tongue extended. Shading along the length of its body suggests scales. The snake's body forms four loops. Two birdsprobably dovessit or lie on the ground below the snake. The bird to the left faces right while the bird to the right faces left. Their beaks are touching. The bird to the left spreads its wings slightly. A horse with a visible mane and tail stands to the right of the central male figure. The horse faces forward and slightly right with its head turned down and to the left. The horse's front left leg is bent and raised off the ground. Both front hooves are visible. A sheep with curved horns stands in the lower right corner of the image. The sheep faces left and grazes with its head down. The sheep's eyes are closed or perhaps cast downward. The sheep's left foreleg is visible with the hoof clearly distinguishable. A peacock stands on a rock or mound of earth to the left of the central figure. The peacock is seen from behind with its head turned to the right; it may look at the male figure. The peacock's tail feathers extend downward. A rooster stands on a rock or mound of earth to the left of the central figure. The rooster faces right in profile with its head turned up. Its beak is open with the tongue extended; it is likely crowing. The rooster's tail feathers form a plume and a spiky comb appears on its head. A winged insect, possibly a moth, flies in the upper left corner of the image, facing left. A bird sits on a slender branch at the left border of the image, below the rooster. The bird faces left with its head turned to the right. The shape of its beak suggests that this may be a parrot. A horned ox or cow appears to the left of the central figure. Lines on the cow's body (to the left and right of the rooster) suggest long hair or fur. The animal is likely standing and faces to the right. Its head is down and its mouth is open slightly; it may be grazing. An eagle with outstretched wings sits or rests in the tree directly above the central male figure. The eagle's feathers are clearly visible. The eagle faces forward with its head turned up and to the right. Horizontal lines in the upper portion of the design indicate sky.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>Adam</characteristic><characteristic>Eden</characteristic><characteristic>naming</characteristic><characteristic>short hair</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>eyes raised</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>sitting</characteristic><characteristic>legs bent</characteristic><characteristic>tiptoe</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>arm resting</characteristic><characteristic>hand raised, palm out</characteristic><characteristic>hand raised, palm up</characteristic><characteristic>palm out</characteristic><characteristic>fingers spread</characteristic><characteristic>arm down</characteristic><characteristic>touching</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A nude male with short, curly hair sits below a tree in the center of the design.

The elephant faces right with its head turned up. Its mouth is open with the tusks extend upward. Its right eye is raised and it likely looks at the figure above. The elephant holds and lifts a dark-skinned male with its trunk wrapped around the figure's waist. The figure is partly nude and wears short pants and a cloth turban. His legs extend down and to the left; the left leg crossed in front of the right, and only the figure's left foot is visible. The figure's right arm is down at his side with the palm turned down. His left arm is bent and he touches the elephant's trunk with his left hand. The figure faces forward with his head turned left in profile; his expression suggests fear or surprise. The setting is likely a city street in India; the ground may be bare earth or is perhaps covered with grass. A tent-like structure, described in the poem as a gardener's shed, appears to the right of the elephant.  In this context, the shed would appear to serve as a market stall. The shed's sloped roof is supported by at least two visible posts. A plate or shallow basket rests on the shed's counter; the plate is piled with fruit or other food, including two pineapples. Two wicker baskets with distinct handles stand on the ground below the shed; both are filled with round, possibly leafy fruits. A wall or building appears in the background to the right of the elephant. An arch appears in the middle of the structure, likely representing a door or open entryway. At least three posts or pillars support a small domed roof above the structure; a spire rises above the roof. A building with three domes on the roof appears above and to the left of the elephant. Each dome is topped with a spire.

A house apparently made of stone or brick stands in the right portion of the design. The building is at least two stories tall with a ledge or balcony supported above the first floor by two pillars.  This ledge or balcony also serves as a roof for the porch below. An arched entryway is visible between the pillars; the door stands open. A leafy potted plant is visible through the open doorway. Two pilasters appear to the left and right of the arch. A single open window is visible on the second story of the house. A second window is visible through the open doorway. The building is raised on a step or other plinth-like platform. A dark-skinned male stands on a ledge or balcony above the first floor of the house. The figure is partly nude and wears short pants and a cloth turban. His left leg is bent and enters the open window; his right leg is extended backward and to the left. His right arm is bent upward; his right hand and left arm are not pictured. The figure faces right with his head turned forward, towards the viewer. He may look down and to the left towards the tiger below.  The man's lunging posture suggests that he is fleeing the beast. The tiger, which may be pursuing the man, stands facing right in a crouched position with its head down. Its mouth is open and its two canine teeth are visible. The tiger's eyes are raised and it looks at the figure on the ledge above. The ground below may be bare earth or is perhaps covered with grass. The trunk of a tree appears in the foreground along the right border of the image. Two leafy branches split off from the main trunk. A snake-like vine wraps around the trunk of the tree and the upper branch. Seven leaves appear along the vine. A tendril forms two loops suggestive of a spiral to the left of the tree trunk. Four large leaves appear below the tree along the lower border of the design. Indeterminate leafy vegetation appears to the left of the house; it may represent a jungle or forest. Two palm trees with distinct trunks and arching leaves appear above the tiger; a third palm tree appears at the left border of the image. A group of four buildings with domed roofs appear above the tiger. Each roof is topped with a spire. A triangular structure below the rightmost dome may represent a tent. A column or tower rises above the trees to the left of the domes; the structure is topped with a palmette or other decorative design.

She is identified as an African woman, Boulla, in Hayley's poem "The Lion." She is the mother of the boy to the right and the wife of the male in the tree, above and to the left. She is partly nude and wears a skirt and a cloth cap or turban over her curly hair. Boulla is seen from behind; she faces away with her head turned to the left and her mouth open slightly. The figure stands with her legs spread apart and her right foot raised on tiptoe. Her right arm is bent upward with the palm of her right hand turned up. Her left arm is bent and she holds a stringed bow in her left hand. Two arrows appear on the ground below the female figure. The arrowheads point to the left. Both arrows have visible fletchings, possibly made of feather. A dark-skinned African male child stands in the lower right portion of the design; his left foot may be raised on tiptoe. He is not identified in Hayley's poem by name, but likely represents Boulla's son. The child wears a skirt and has short, curly hair. He faces forward with his head turned up and to the left in profile. His mouth is open slightly and his left eye is raised; he may look at Boulla or towards the figure in the tree above and to the left. The child's arms are bent upward with the right palm facing down and the left palm facing slightly up. A lion stands in the lower left portion of the design, facing left. The lion's mouth is open with teeth visible and the tongue extended. Its neck or lower jaw is pierced by an arrow, and it wears an expression of pain. A dark-skinned African male appears in the upper left corner of the design, among the leaves of a palm tree. His hair is short and curly. The figure is identified as Demba in Hayley's poem, "The Lion." He is the husband of the female archer and the father of the male child. Only his upper body is visible. His arms are bent upward at approximately 135 degrees; he holds onto palm leaves with both hands. He faces forward with his head turned slightly right; he may look down toward the figures below. Two bunches of round fruit appear in the tree, to the left and below Demba. A second palm tree grows along the right border of the design; a bunch of fruit is visible at the top of the palm's trunk. The ground below both trees is covered with grass. The lion stands on a cliff or ledge in the left portion of the design while Boulla and her son stand on a cliff below and to the right. A third cliff is visible in the middle distance above and to the left of Boulla. A body of water, perhaps a river or the sea, appears between the cliffs near the lower border of the design. A distant mountain rises above the water. Indeterminate, leafy vegetation extends to the left and right of Boulla and her son; this may represent a forest or jungle located on the cliff in the middle distance. A single tree trunk is distinguishable to the left of Boulla's left leg. Etched lines in the upper portion of the design indicate a sky with clouds.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="D"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>Boulla</characteristic><characteristic>dark-skinned</characteristic><characteristic>African</characteristic><characteristic>mother</characteristic><characteristic>mouth open</characteristic><characteristic>seen from behind</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>legs spread</characteristic><characteristic>tiptoe</characteristic><characteristic>partly nude</characteristic><characteristic>skirt</characteristic><characteristic>cloth</characteristic><characteristic>turban</characteristic><characteristic>hat</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent</characteristic><characteristic>hand raised, palm up</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>bow</characteristic><characteristic>facing away</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A dark-skinned female stands in the lower right portion of the design.

The figure leans backward and to the right. Both legs are bent and spread apart with his right foot raised on tiptoe. His arms are bent upward with the left palm turned slightly up and the right palm held vertically. Indeterminate leafy vegetation appears on the cliff to the right of Edward; it may represent moss or lichens. A dog with curly fur falls upside down in the lower left portion of the design. The dog is identified as Fido in Hayley's poem. The dog's legs are spread with the rear legs extended upward and the forelegs extended down. The open jaws of a crocodile appear above the water in the lower left corner of the image; its teeth are clearly visible. The crocodile faces up and to the right.
