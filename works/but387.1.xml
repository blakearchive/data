The figure of Moses dominates the design. He has a beard and wears a transparent gown. He faces forward, but looks to the left with his mouth open. His arms are raised above his head, with one palm facing forward and one palm up. His left foot is extended forward.  His expression suggests surprise and anger. At Moses's feet lie the cracked stone tablets bearing the ten commandments. To Moses's left are three nude figures. One figure, seen from behind, has its arms raised at 135 degrees and stands on tiptoe, with left leg behind the right. The figure's posture is dance-like. The figure holds a sistrum (an ancient Egyptian musical instrument) in the right hand and a tambourine in the left. The figure also faces right and appears to be kissing a figure who faces forward with head turned to the left. Both figures have short, curly hair; their gender is unclear. Behind these two appears to be a figure of indeterminate gender with its arms raised, facing away and looking right. The idol of the golden calf stands on a stone(?) plinth or altar to the left of Moses and above the smaller cavorting figures. It faces right. Though the background is dark, there are indications of mountains or hills right of Moses. Dark smoke billows across the sky behind Moses.  The smoke is red at its edges, suggesting the fires of burnt offerings.  The sky upper left includes a few reddish clouds, either reflecting the implied fire or a sunrise or sunset.  There may be grass on the ground lower left.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>Moses</characteristic><characteristic>old</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>transparent</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>legs spread</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>mouth open</characteristic><characteristic>arms raised</characteristic><characteristic>arms bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>fingers spread</characteristic><characteristic>hand raised, palm up</characteristic><characteristic>hand raised, palm out</characteristic><characteristic>palm out</characteristic><characteristic>left foot</characteristic><characteristic>knees</characteristic><characteristic>surprise</characteristic><characteristic>anger</characteristic><illusobjdesc> The figure of Moses dominates the design.
