            twelve water-color illustrations to John Milton's poems "L'Allegro" and "Il Penseroso,"

            now in the Pierpont Morgan Library, New York. These splendid designs are published in

            our new Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image

            Search and Inote (our image annotation program). Each design is accompanied by a

            manuscript leaf that includes a quotation of the lines illustrated and brief

            interpretive comments by Blake. These manuscript leaves are also reproduced here in

            sequence following each design.<lb/><lb/> Produced for Blake's chief patron, Thomas

            Butts, c. 1816-20, the "L'Allegro" and "Il Penseroso" illustrations exhibit the delicacy

            and refinement typical of Blake's late water-color style. Milton's contrasting companion

            poems gave Blake yet another opportunity to explore his own sense of contrariety, much

            as he did earlier in his career in <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of

            Experience</hi>. Through the careful selection of passages to illustrate, Blake also

            emphasizes the visionary and transformative moments in Milton's poems.<lb/><lb/> At

            present the Archive contains 45 copies of 18 of Blake's 19 illuminated books (all fully

            searchable); the Thomas Butts set of Blake's water colors illustrating the Book of Job,

            also in the Pierpont Morgan Library; and now the first of several series of Milton

            illustrations that we will be adding in Preview. In the near future we expect to release

            more drawings and prints in Preview, a much-anticipated electronic edition of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> Copy E, and further supplementary materials, including a

            biography and glossary.<lb/><lb/> As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site,

            imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made

            possible through the continuing support of the Institute for Advanced Technology in the

            Humanities at the University of Virginia, by a major grant from the Preservation and

            Access Division of the National Endowment for the Humanities, by the University of North

            Carolina at Chapel Hill, and by the cooperation of the international array of libraries

            and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their

                  surrounded by at least twenty-two other figures. Her hair is long and curly, and

                  she wears a crown or wreath of small berries or flowers. She smiles and looks out

                  toward the viewer. A halo or possibly a small cloud surrounds her head. At least

                  three spirits appear above and to the left of Mirth's head within the halo or

                  cloud structure. The second figure from the bottom may be seen from behind with

                  its right leg partly drawn up. A fourth indistinct figure may appear to the right. A

                  female nymph—possibly representing the personification of

                  Liberty—stands or hovers in the lower left portion of the design. She is gowned and

                  may be wearing leggings or stockings. A quiver containing at

                  least two arrows hangs by a strap over her left shoulder. With her right hand she

                  grasps the feathered tail of an arrow; she also holds hands with (or at least touches the hand of) Mirth. A male spirit stands or hovers just to the left of the central figure, wearing short

                  breeches or tights and a shirt with an elaborate, ruffled collar. Two gowned,

                  female nymphs stand or hover to the right of Mirth. The figure closest to Mirth bends her

                  arms upwards above her head; the figure to the right has her arms bent with the

                  palms held out at shoulder-height. The ground below the figures is govered with

                  grass. Leafy vegetation appears in the lower left corner of the

                  design; this may represent distant trees. Regtangular shapes in the lower left

                  corner of the image suggest a distant building or buildings. Additional shapes in

                  the lower right may represent a city, including triangular spires. A distant

                  mountain rises above the city in the lower right corner of the design. A female

                  nymph flies or hovers near the right border of the design. The figure is gowned

                  with bat-like wings surrounding her head, torso, and upper legs. A male

                  spirit—possibly representing Milton's "wrinkled Care"—flies or

                  hovers near the right border of the design. The figure has two horns on his head

                  and is seen in a contracted position with his arms crossed and his left knee

                  raised to his chest. The figure wears an expression of anger or disapproval. A

                  nude male spirit hovers or flies to the right of the central figure. His arms are

                  bent with his hands grasping his sides; he is smiling and likely represents

                  Milton's "Laughter." Three nude spirits fly or hover above the figure of Laughter.

                  The largest figure in the group has its legs spread and arms raised horizontally;

                  its head is bent back and turned to the left. A nude spirit flies or hovers above

                  and to the left of Mirth's raised left hand; it plays a long trumpet or musical horn held in its extended 

                  right hand. Three circles, possibly bubbles, appear in the upper right corner of the design,

                  to the right of the trumpet. Below, a nude female(?) spirit flies or hovers with

                  her arms bent upward; she is seen from behind. A gowned spirit flies or hovers to

                  the right; the figure faces left with his or her body horizontal. The figure's

                  arms are bent with the palms turned up. Five female spirits appear above and to

                  the left of the central figure of Mirth; they are likely flying or hovering, but

                  may also rest on a small band of clouds. The central figure of the group flies

                  diagonally downward and to the left. Her arms are extended down and to the left;

                  she points with both hands towards the gowned male spirit below. The gowned male

                  flies or hovers to the left of Mirth. He is seen from behind with his lower body facing left; his

                  torso and head are twisted to the right. His head is bent back and he looks up and

                  slightly to the right towards the female figures above. Yellow and red washes in

                  the lower half of the design suggest a sky at sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>Mirth</characteristic><characteristic>nymph</characteristic><characteristic>spirit</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>partly nude</characteristic><characteristic>transparent</characteristic><characteristic>breasts</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>halo</characteristic><characteristic>cloud</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>smiling</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>hovering</characteristic><characteristic>dancing</characteristic><characteristic>tiptoe</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent</characteristic><characteristic>arms bent</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised at 135 degrees</characteristic><characteristic>palm out</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised at 45 degrees</characteristic><characteristic>touching</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>hand holding</characteristic><characteristic>touching</characteristic><characteristic>fingers spread</characteristic><characteristic>wreath</characteristic><characteristic>crown</characteristic><characteristic>flower</characteristic><characteristic>berry</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The female personification of Mirth stands or hovers in the center of the

                     and curly, and she wears a crown or wreath of small berries or flowers. She

                     smiles and looks out toward the viewer. A halo or possibly a small cloud

                     surrounds her head. The figure stands or hovers with her right foot on tiptoe; her left

                     leg is bent and her left foot is raised above the ground. She may be dancing.

                     Both arms are bent slightly. Her left arm is raised at approximately 135

                     degrees with the palm turned out toward the viewer. Her right arm is raised at

                     approximately 45 degrees; she holds (or at least touches) hands with the figure furthest to the

                  left.  The fingers of both hands are slightly spread.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="C"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>nymph</characteristic><characteristic>spirit</characteristic><characteristic>Liberty</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>hovering</characteristic><characteristic>tiptoe</characteristic><characteristic>dancing</characteristic><characteristic>arms bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>palm vertical</characteristic><characteristic>palm down</characteristic><characteristic>fingers spread</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>touching</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>eyes raised</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>quiver</characteristic><characteristic>arrow</characteristic><characteristic>feather</characteristic><characteristic>stockings</characteristic><characteristic>leaning</characteristic><characteristic>arching</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A female nymph—possibly representing the personification of

                  The figure is nude and faces forward with his genitals exposed. His hair is

                  flame-like and he wears a spiky crown. Beams of light radiate outward from his

                  head, and his body is surrounded by an aura of flames. The figure appears to stand

                  with his feet raised on tiptoe; his left foot touches the central mountain in the

                  scene below while his right rests on the lower step of an arched structure,

                  possibly representing Milton's "Eastern Gate." The figure's arms are raised

                  horizontally. His left palm is held vertically and he holds a scepter in his right

                  hand. The disc of the sun surrounds the central figure. A few beams of light

                  radiate outward from the lower half of the sun. Blue wash surrounding the sun

                  indicates sky. Several clouds are visible within and around the sphere of the sun.

                  The figures surrounding the personification of the sun represent Milton's "Clouds

                  in thousand Liveries." Four trumpeters fly or hover within the lower portion of

                  the sun, to the left and right of the central figure. Three nude male(?) figures, possibly chilren,

                  stand or hover below the Sun's right arm. Each figure holds a vase or pitcher in

                  front of his chest. The head of a trumpeter appears just to the left of the Sun's

                  right hand; the figure faces slightly right and plays a trumpet or musical horn that extends

                  upwards and to the right from his or her mouth. A figure of indeterminate gender

                  flies or hovers below and to the right of the sun's left arm; the figure's arms

                  are bent upward and holds a plate or basket with four round fruits on top of its

                  head. The head and upper arms of a figure hovers just right of the sun's left

                  hand; the figure faces forward with its arms bent upward and its hands clutching

                  its head. The upper body of a female(?) figure with long hair appears above and to

                  the right of the sun. She faces left with her head turned back to the right; her

                  left arm is bent upwards with the palm turned up. The head of a female(?) figure

                  appears above and to the right of the sun, facing left; she may be smiling. A

                  bunch of fruit, possibly grapes, appears in the sky in the upper right corner of

                  the design. Green coloring suggests at least one leaf above the round fruit. A

                  nude female flies or hovers left of the disc of the sun. She is upside down and

                  seen from behind. Her arms are extended downward; she pours liquid from a vial or

                  other vessel held in her left hand. Three nude female figures fly or hover above

                  and to the left of the Sun. The figure furthest left is positioned with her right

                  leg drawn up. The figures to the right are partially obscured so that only their

                  heads and portions of their upper bodies are visible. Each of the three figures

                  holds a plate of fruit in her outstretched left hand and pours liquid from a bowl or goblet

                  held with the right hand. Two figures fly or hover in the upper left corner of the

                  image. The figures are upside down and arch or bend with their legs to the right

                  around the frame of the Eastern Gate. Both figures' arms extended downward. At

                  least nine indistinct figures fly or hover near the center of the top border of

                  the image. Six figures appear to the left of the plates of food, while at least

                  three and as many as six appear to the right. The figures appear to be gowned. The

                  three figures furthest left raise their right arms at 135 degrees. The ground at

                  the bottom of the design is covered with grass. Two leafy trees appear in the

                  lower left and lower right corner of the design. The trunk of the tree to the left

                  splits into two branches. In his description, Blake identifies the tree to the

                  right as a hawthorne; the tree to the left may represent an elm. An angel or other

                  winged spirit flies in front of a tree in the lower left corner of the design;

                  another angel or winged spirit flies facing left in front of the tree in the lower

                  right. Three mountains rise above the pastoral scene at the bottom of the design.

                  In the lower portion of the design, a figure pushes a plow drawn by two horned oxen.

                  The figure is bent forward and walks to the right. A female(?) figure stands to

                  the right of the plow in the lower portion of the design; this figure may

                  represent Milton's "Milkmaid." A horned cow lies near the milkmaid, facing left; another lies to the right, facing right. A

                  figure stands to the right of the milkmaid in the lower portion of the design. The

                  figure's right arm is raised horizontally and holds an indeterminate curved object

                  above its head. This may represent Milton's "Mower," which would suggest that the

                  object is his scythe. A solitary gowned figure stands on a small hillock to the

                  right of the mower. Blake's notes suggest that this may represent Milton. Two

                  gowned figures stand beneath a tree in the lower right corner of the design.

                  According to Blake's description, they likely represent "the Shepherd" and "his

                  Lass." The figures appear to face each other. Two winged angels stand on the lower

                  step of the Eastern Gate to the left and right of the sphere of the sun. Both are

                  gowned and hold trumpets or musical horns at their sides.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>Sun</characteristic><characteristic>sun</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>genitals</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>tiptoe</characteristic><characteristic>flame-like hair</characteristic><characteristic>crown</characteristic><characteristic>spiky</characteristic><characteristic>beams of light</characteristic><characteristic>aura</characteristic><characteristic>fire</characteristic><characteristic>arms raised horizontally</characteristic><characteristic>palm vertical</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>scepter</characteristic><characteristic>fleur-de-lis</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The male personification of the sun stands in the center of the

                     appears to stand with his feet raised on tiptoe; his left foot touches the

                     central mountain in the scene below while his right rests on the lower step of

                     an arched structure, possibly representing Milton's "Eastern Gate." The Sun's

                     arms are raised horizontally. His left palm is held vertically while in his

                  legs bent beneath her. She is nude and wears a crown.  A cascade of water, perhaps a waterfall that extends into a river, descends from her left shoulder. A walled(?) city appears in

                  her lap. Several windows are visible in the lower right portion of the wall and

                  two tall spires rise above the wall. The head and left shoulder of a male mountain

                  appear to the right of the female mountain. He has a beard and wears a crown of

                  leaves. A house with a sloping roof and a window or door stands below the male

                  mountain. Below the house is a winding path or road. Above the mountains, beams of

                  light radiate outward from the sun. A horizontal band of clouds appears across the

                  chests of the male and female mountains; at least seventeen figures representing

                  personified clouds appear in the sky above and to the left and right of the

                  mountains. Several of these figures hold objects, including trumpets or musical horns, tambourines,

                  vases or urns, and a basket. Two gowned angels also appear in the sky to

                  the left and right of the mountains; both play (or at least hold) trumpets or musical horns. Two figures lay or

                  recline on a mountain or hill to the left of the personified female mountain. The figure on

                  the right side of the mountain is a nude female with her breasts exposed. Below

                  and to the left, a second figure reclines at the base of the mountain, on the

                  shore of a lake. The female personification of a river appears below and

                  to the right of the female mountain. The female river holds a goblet or chalice in

                  her left hand; her head is bent back as she drinks from the cup. She leans to the

                  right against a vase or other vessel; water pours into the river below. The river

                  extends horizontally across the design and empties into a lake at the left border

                  of the image. Several long, rectangular buildings appear to the left of the

                  personified river. The building furthest left has a clearly defined roof. The

                  roofs of two buildings are visible below the personified river; there may be another building right of her right hand. The spire of a

                  Gothic church rises above a forest of trees at the left border of the design. The

                  top of an arched window is visible just above the tree line. The forest of leafy

                  trees extends from the left to the right border in the lower portion of the design.

                  The trunks and branches of several trees are clearly visible. The head and right

                  arm of a male figure appear among the leaves of a tree in the lower right portion

                  of the image; the figure represents the personification of the tree. His hair is

                  long and he has a beard. Three spirits fly or hover to the right of the tree. The

                  two uppermost spirits play trumpets; the third spirit has butterfly wings. A group

                  of eight figures stand below the personified tree; they may represent a family.

                  From left to right, the family includes: a young boy playing a pipe; a gowned

                  female cradling an infant in her arms; a gowned child; an old gowned female with a

                  walking stick in her right hand; an old bearded male with a walking stick in his

                  left hand; and two gowned children. A pole stands in the lower portion of the

                  design, slightly left of center. Two triangles are formed near the top of the pole

                  by a crossbeam or circular structure and thin lines decorated with flowers or fruit. This likely

                  represents a maypole. A male musician stands directly below the maypole; he plays

                  a violin or fiddle. At least seven other figures dance to the left and right with

                  their arms raised at 135 degrees.  Most hold the raised hands of their companions. The ground below the figures is covered with

                  grass.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>mountain</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>sitting</characteristic><characteristic>kneeling</characteristic><characteristic>crown</characteristic><characteristic>wall</characteristic><characteristic>legs bent</characteristic><characteristic>arm at side</characteristic><characteristic>arm dangling</characteristic><characteristic>arm on lap</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent</characteristic><characteristic>hand on breasts</characteristic><characteristic>fingers spread</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>water</characteristic><characteristic>waterfall</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>cloth</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A personified female mountain sits or kneels in the center of the design with her

                     rests at her side and dangles over her lap.  A cascade of water, perhaps a waterfall that becomes a river, descends from her left shoulder.  Perhaps this is also meant to be an extension of her long hair or a cloth over her shoulder.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="AB"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>mountain</characteristic><characteristic>upper body</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>head</characteristic><characteristic>shoulder</characteristic><characteristic>crown</characteristic><characteristic>leaf</characteristic><characteristic>touching</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>mouth open</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The head and left shoulder of a male mountain appears to the right

                     to the right with their bodies nearly horizontal. To the left, a figure flies

                     with his or her arms raised at 135 degrees; the figure holds two circular

                     objects, likely tambourines. To the left, two figures hold an urn or vase with

                     two curved handles. The figure to the right of the urn bends at the waist and

                     may face to the left; the figure to the left has its right leg slightly bent.

                     To the left, two figures hold and play trumpets or musical horns. The uppermost trumpeter bends

                     twist its upper body to face to the left. Below, a figure bends his or her arms

                     upward and holds a large wicker basket above its head. The figure may be seen

                     from behind. Below and to the right, two figures fly facing left. The

                     appears to contain one or two large, round fruits.  the next figure to the right is represented by the outline of its head and one shoulder. To the right, and closest to the personified female mountain, a figure is

This

                  represents Milton's "Goblin." The figure is partially transparent. The goblin is

                  twisted with his arms and legs extended to the right. He drops a flail and a large

                  bowl from his raised hands. A gowned female sits on a raised platform in the upper

                  left potion of the design. She is identified by Blake in his description of the design as Queen Mab. She is

                  surrounded by an aura of light and she may wear a crown. Her left arm is bent and

                  she may reach towards the plate of food to the right. Her right arm is bent

                  upwards and she holds a cup or possibly food in her right hand. A gowned spirit

                  flies or hovers to the right of Mab. The figure holds a plate of

                  food—possibly fruit—above his or her head. The scene takes place

                  at night. A cloud band passes across the goblin's hips, while another appears

                  above and to the right of the goblin's head. At least twenty stars appear in the

                  sky, five of which appear on or through the goblin's body. Perhaps two more

                  indistinct stars appear to the left and right of the flail, although it is difficult to distingish these from abraded areas on the design. A house or cottage

                  stands in the lower left corner of the design. The building has a roof, probably of straw,

                  and a chimney. The wall facing the viewer is transparent to reveal the room

                  within. A window with two panes is also visible. A female lies supine on a bed

                  within the cottage. Her head rests on a pillow to the left, and her body is

                  covered by bed linens. She grasps her head with her hands; her mouth may be open in an expression of fear. The head and shoulders of a ghost appear above and to the

                  right of the bed. The ghost faces left with its arms extended down and to the

                  left; it holds and pulls the bedclothes. Four nude fairies appear in the cottage

                  in the lower left corner of the design; they may be dancing. The lowest fairy

                  appears to reach upward and may be climbing onto the bed below the female figure.

                  Another fairy stands above the bed and lunges to the right. Two

                  additional fairies appear upside down on the ceiling of the room. A building

                  stands in the lower right corner of the design. It may represent a barn or stable.

                  A large door with clearly visible hinges faces the viewer. A male figure appears

                  between the two buildings in the lower portion of the design. He is seen from

                  behind and faces away with his head turned to the right. He bends slightly forward with

                  both legs bent and his left foot raised on tiptoe; he is walking and follows the

                  spirit to the right. A friar, possibly holding a lantern, appears between the two buildings in the lower portion of the

                  design. He is seen from behind and faces to the right with his head turned back to

                  the left; he may look at the figure to the left. The friar's lower half is

                  obscured. A distant building is visible on a hill or cliff above the the male

                  figure and the friar. This may represent the "Convent" mentioned in

                  Blake's description. The structure has an outer wall with two towers flanking an arched

                  entryway. The tower on the left is topped with a spire. A dark mass above and to

                  the right of the convent may represent a distant forest of leafy trees.  The ground just above the lower border of the design is grassy.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>spirit</characteristic><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>goblin</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>transparent</characteristic><characteristic>flying</characteristic><characteristic>hovering</characteristic><characteristic>twisted</characteristic><characteristic>leg extended</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised at 135 degrees</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>palm down</characteristic><characteristic>palm vertical</characteristic><characteristic>fingers spread</characteristic><characteristic>eyes raised</characteristic><characteristic>mouth open</characteristic><characteristic>teeth</characteristic><characteristic>horn</characteristic><characteristic>bald</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A nude male spirit flies or hover in the center of the design.

                  or river. He rests on a small hill or hillock covered with grass. His head is bent

                  back with his eyes closed; the poet is sleeping and dreaming. His head is

                  surrounded by a dark halo. Milton's right arm rests on a book to the left; he

                  holds a quill or pen in his right hand and he may be writing. The sun sets in the

                  sky to the left of Milton. Two trees grow to the left and right of the poet along

                  the vertical edges of the design. Both have distinct roots, trunks, and leaves.

                  The tree to the right also has disctinct branches. The leaves of both trees arch

                  up and towards the center of the upper border. A small nude(?) figure appears below

                  and to the left of Milton. The figure walks or strides to the left with its legs

                  spread apart. The figure's arms are raised at 135 degrees with the palms turned

                  up. Two gowned figures stand embracing in the lower left corner of the design. The

                  figure on the right has his or her head down and resting on the right shoulder of

                  the figure to the left. Three gowned females fly or hover in the lower right

                  portion of the design. They may represent ghosts. Two gowned males representing

                  Jonson ("Johnson" in Blake's description of the design) and Shakespeare hover in the upper portion of the design, above Milton.

                  The figure to the left (probably Jonson) faces right and holds an open book and quill pen. The

                  figure to the right (probably Shakespeare) faces forward and holds a set of pipes. Beams of light emanate from both figures' heads. A large circle

                  representing the "Sun of Imagination" appears in the sky between Jonson and

                  Shakespeare. Beams of light radiate outward from the lower half of the sun. As

                  many as eighteen figures appear within the circle of the sun; the figures are

                  surrounded by flames and possibly smoke. In the top center of the sun, Hymen

                  stands between a bride (left) and groom (right). Hymen is gowned and a halo of

                  light surrounds his head. He may hold hands with the bride and groom. Six

                  indistinct gowned figures stand to the left and right. Three female musicians

                  stand below the marriage scene. The figure furthest left is seen from behind; she

                  holds and may play a harp or lyre. The central figure faces forward and holds two trumpets or musical horns

                  in her hands. The figure furthest right holds and may play a tambourine. As many as

                  six indistinct figures hover above the flames to the left and right of the

                  musicians.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>young</characteristic><characteristic>Milton</characteristic><characteristic>poet</characteristic><characteristic>lying</characteristic><characteristic>reclining</characteristic><characteristic>supine</characteristic><characteristic>sleeping</characteristic><characteristic>dreaming</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>halo</characteristic><characteristic>shirt</characteristic><characteristic>collar</characteristic><characteristic>breeches</characteristic><characteristic>shoes</characteristic><characteristic>head bent back</characteristic><characteristic>eyes closed</characteristic><characteristic>smiling</characteristic><characteristic>legs extended</characteristic><characteristic>arm resting</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>writing</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>hand raised, palm out</characteristic><characteristic>fingers spread</characteristic><characteristic>facing up</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A young male poet representing Milton reclines on the bank of a

                  stand on a cloud above the personification of Fast. They probably represent the

                  surrounds his body. Leisure's arms are crossed in front of his chest. Two tall,

                  vine-like plants appear to the left and right of Leisure; both have several leaves

                  and large flowers or fruit. A forest of leafy trees appears left and right of the

                  plinth of two steps (described as a throne in the poem) above the central figure. The figure has large, outstretched wings. His

                  arms are raised horizontally with the palms turned up. His right knee is drawn up

                  and his right foot is visible below the hem of his garment. A gowned female(?)

                  representing Night rests on a cloud to the left of Melancholy. The figure lies in

                  Her legs are crossed at the ankles. Night's arms are bent and wrap around her

                  head. Her head is turned down and she looks at the nude figure below. A nude

                  female representing Philomel hovers below Night. The figure is seen from

                  behind. Her right leg is bent with the sole of her right foot turned out towards

                  the viewer. Philomel's arms are raised vertically and her head is turned up; she

                  may be reaching toward Night. A gowned female representing the goddess Cynthia

                  kneels on a crescent moon to the right of Melancholy. The figure is seen from

                  beind and faces to the right. Cynthia's left arm appears to be braced against the

                  crescent moon; her right arm is bent forward with her wrist resting on the tip of

                  the moon. The moon is drawn by two bat-winged dragons to the right. The dragons' heads

                  are topped by spiky crests and their tails extend above and to the left of the

                  moon. The dragons' mouths are open; the upper dragon holds its head up with the

                  tongue extended. Cynthia holds the dragons' reins in her right hand. A cloud

                  covers her shins and feet. Her legs are spread apart with the left leg slightly

                  bent; both feet appear to be raised on tiptoe. She may stride or walk to the

                  right. Both arms are bent; her right arm is bent upward. The figure's

                  right palm is held vertically and the left is turned out away from the viewer; the

                  fingers on both hands are spread. She faces forward with her head turned to the

                  left; her eyes are raised and her expression suggests fear or apprehension. A crescent moon (but with its full circular form still visible)

                  appears above and to the right of the female Moon. It is surrounded by a halo;

                  beams of light radiate outward from the halo. The scene takes place at night. A

                  continuous band of clouds forms a horseshoe around the personification of the

                  Moon. A total of fourteen stars appear in the sky attached to vine-like

                  structures. A body of water extends horizontally across the lower half of the

                  design. It may be a lake, river, or the sea. Small waves are visible throughout.

                  The ground below Milton is covered with grass. Four flowers or buds appear in the

                  lower left corner of the design. Above the water, leafy vegetation may suggest a

                  dense forest of trees. A church is visible within the leafy forest, directly below

                  the female Moon. It has a tall spire or steeple and a single arched window or door.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="D"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>Milton</characteristic><characteristic>student</characteristic><characteristic>seen from behind</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>head up</characteristic><characteristic>eyes raised</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>hat</characteristic><characteristic>shoes</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>tiptoe</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent</characteristic><characteristic>palm out</characteristic><characteristic>hand raised, palm out</characteristic><characteristic>fingers spread</characteristic><characteristic>facing away</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Milton stands in the lower right corner of the design facing left;

                  left. His left arm is bent and rests in his lap with his left hand on his knee.

                  His right arm is bent upward with the elbow resting on an open book; he holds his

                  forehead with his right hand. Milton's eyes are cast down and he may be reading.

                  The spirit of Plato stands or hovers to the left of Milton. He faces forward with

                  his head turned slightly down and to the right; his eyes are cast down and he

                  looks at Milton. Plato's left arm is down at his side. His right arm is bent

                  upward with the palm held vertically and the fingers spread; he may point upwards.

                  Three figures lay supine below and to the left of Plato; only their heads and

                  shoulders are visible. The two upper figures have beards. The three figures' eyes

                  are closed and they may be dead. Three figures representing fire spirits appear in

                  a column of fire to the left of Plato. Two nude females stand or hover within the

                  fire. The figure furthest left raises her arms above her head, while the figure to

                  the right holds her hands beside her head. Both look up towards a third spirit;

                  this figure raises his or her arms vertically and may be falling. Six figures

                  representing the spirits of earth lay on the ground below Milton. The figures are

                  surrounded by large leaves, and the ground may be covered with grass. The spirit

                  furthest left rests its head on its right hand; only its upper body is visible,

                  and it may be partially buried in the earth. To the right, a child or infant is

                  held by a nude female; the child's right arm and leg appear to be wrapped in

                  vines. To the right, a nude female lays horizontally with her arms raised at 135

                  degrees. The figure is vegetating; her right arm grows into a branch with three

                  flowers and the toes on her left foot terminate in vines or roots. A branch with a

                  single flower extends from the top of her head to the right. To the right, two

                  nude figures lay on their sides and appear to be partially buried in the earth.

                  The figure furthest right is seen from behind. Two figures representing water spirits appear to the right of Milton. The

                  uppermost figure is a nude female with fins that look like bat wings; she may be hovering or

                  swimming. The spirit holds an object in her right hand; it may be a shuttle or the end of a large

                  net that appears below the figure. The lower figure falls or hovers upside down,

                  and may be caught in the net. Five figures representing the spirits of air fly or

                  hover above Milton's head. The group forms a circle or halo of light. The Great

                  Bear constellation appears to the right of Milton. The bear stands facing right in

                  profile. Seven stars form the constellation within and to the left of the bear's

                  body. Hermes flies or hovers above and to the right of Milton. He is seen from

                  behind with his head turned to the left. He wears a gown or cloak and a winged

                  helmet. The figure's arms are down at his side and he may point downward with his

                  left hand. His right hand is obscured, but he likely holds a scepter that appears

                  to the right of his lower body. Three circles appear in the upper portion of the

                  design; the images within these circles represent Plato's Heavens. Coloring within

                  each circle suggests fire and possibly smoke. The central circle is partially

                  obscured by the other two. A nude female representing Venus stands in the circle

                  furthest left. She faces forward with her torso twisted and bent slightly to the

                  right.  Her right arm is wrapped around her waist; her left arm is extended. Two nude figures stand back-to-back to the left of Venus. They are bound

                  together by a vine that crosses at their ankles and hips, and rises above their

                  heads. Alternatively, they are bound with a heavy rope and the vegetation above them is a separate motif. A nude(?) figure stands within the leftmost circle to the right of Plato.

                  The figure's left arm is raised horizontally and touches the shoulder or back of

                  the figure to the right. To the right, a nude female(?) stands facing right in

                  profile. Her head is down and apparently rests on her right hand in a posture

                  suggesting grief or despair. A male figure representing Mars appears in the

                  central circle. He wears a gown or other clothing and a hat or helmet. He holds a

                  spear in his left hand. His knees are drawn up in front of his chest. A bat flies

                  on outstretched wings to the left of Mars. A gowned male representing Jupiter

                  appears in the rightmost circle. He sits on a series of platforms possibly

                  representing a throne, altar, or stairs. He has long hair and a beard and may wear

                  a crown of laurels. He holds a scepter spear in his left hand and a set of compasses or dividers in

                  his right. A nude male(?) appears to the left of Jupiter. He is seen from behind

                  and climbs a set of stairs or steps. His right arm is bent and drawn back; his

                  left arm is not clearly pictured, but may reach forward and to the right. He holds

                  or touches a large circular object, possibly a shield. Three nude females

                  representing the Fates sit or kneel above the circles of Plato's Heavens. The

                  figure furthest left is Atropos. she is seen from behind with her head turned to the right. She

                  holds the thread of life in her left hand and an open pair of scissors in her

                  right. Her companion to the right, Lachesis, holds the thread of life in both hands. Her head

                  is turned up and her mouth is open. The figure furthest right, Clotho, holds a distaff in

                  her left hand.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="CD"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>Milton</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>shoe</characteristic><characteristic>left foot</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>sitting</characteristic><characteristic>legs bent</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent</characteristic><characteristic>arm on lap</characteristic><characteristic>hand on knee</characteristic><characteristic>arm resting</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent upward</characteristic><characteristic>hand clutching head</characteristic><characteristic>hand on face</characteristic><characteristic>eyes down</characteristic><characteristic>reading</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Milton sits on a chair or bench in the lower half of the design,

                  down and the fingers slightly spread. The male personification of the Sun sits

                  atop the disc of the sun in the upper portion of the design. He is nude with his

                  genitals exposed. His legs are bent and spread apart, straddling the sun. His

                  right arm is bent upward above his head and his left arm is raised at 135 degrees;

                  he holds and throws darts with both hands. At least three darts appear between the

                  figure's hands, with additional darts and flaming sun beams appearing around the

                  figure; all are pointed down and to the left. Milton and Melancholy stand in a

                  forest of leafy trees; eight tree trunks are visible. Three tree spirits appear in

                  a tree to the left of Melancholy. The central figure of the group is a nude male

                  with long hair and a beard. He holds a scepter, possibly with an acorn finial, in his raised left hand.

                  Three additional tree spirits appear in a tree to the right of Milton. A snake or

                  serpent is coiled around the left arm of the uppermost spirit of the group. Two

                  personified insects fly to the left and right of the sun. The insect to the left

                  may be female; she faces forward and wears a spiky crown. The insect to the right

                  is seen from behind and has two antennae on its head. The ground below the figures

                  is covered with grass. A river or stream runs horizontally across the lower

                  portion of the design. A distant mountain rises above the treeline between Milton

                  and Melancholy. Wash surrounding the sun may suggest a sky at sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="D"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>Milton</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>walking</characteristic><characteristic>tiptoe</characteristic><characteristic>arms at side</characteristic><characteristic>arms down</characteristic><characteristic>hand holding</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>book</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Milton stands in the lower right portion of the design, facing forward and left.

He sleeps

                  with his eyes closed and his head resting on a grassy mound or hillock. His body

                  is nearly horizontal with his legs extended down and to the right. Milton's arms

                  are at his sides with the his forearms resting on his lap; his arms are crossed at

                  the wrists with the palms turned down. Six spirits fly or hover immediately above

                  and below Milton; all six are nearly horizontal with their legs extended to the

                  right. Three of the six figures raise their arms horizontally; the figure

                  upper right bends its left arm and the upper central figure has its arms at its

                  sides.  The figure lower right has its right arm bent upward. At least four of the figures hold and play instruments, including two

                  tambourines, a lyre, and a mandolin. A river or stream extends horizontally across

                  the lower portion of the design. The male(?) personification of Sleep appears

                  above and to the left of Milton; he may be flying or hovering, or possibly lays on or emerges from

                  a cloud. He is upside down and seen from behind with his head bent back and to the

                  right; he may look down at Milton. A halo of light surrounds his head. Two wings

                  extend at approximately 135 degrees relative to the figure's body. Three eyes

                  appear in the figure's left wing, which stretches horizontally above Milton, and four more are visible on the right wing. The

                  figure's right wing also contains a partially unrolled scroll and at least five

                  figures. A gowned female lies on the upper side of a scroll with her body partly

                  horizontal and her legs extended upward. Her arms are bent forward and rest on the

                  scroll. A couple—likely a male (left) and female (right)—appear

                  beneath one of the folds of the scroll. The figures embrace and share a kiss. Two

                  smaller, indistinct figures fly or hover to the left of the couple; the figure

                  furthest left appears to have its arms at its sides. Lines near the tip of the

                  right wing may suggest feathers, a net, or a web.  There may be the face of a sixth figure in this area. Four concentric rings or circles

                  appear in the upper portion of the design; its coloring may suggest a rainbow.

                  Beams of light radiate outward from the center circle. Four spirits appear above

                  Milton within the circle of light. An old male figure with long hair and a beard sits

                  or kneels in the center of the circle, furthest left in the group. Both arms are bent; the

                  figure's left arm rests in his lap. A nude male with short hair flies or hovers

                  second from the left. He faces forward with his legs bent to the left. His head is

                  down and his shoulders prominent. The figure's arms are bent and wrap around his

                  head; he may clutch his head with his left hand. An old gowned male with long hair and

                  a beard flies or hovers third from the left. He faces forward with his legs

                  extended to the left. A halo of light surrounds his head. His arms are bent upward

                  in front of his chest with the palms turned out toward the viewer. The figure

                  furthest right sits in a contracted position with both legs drawn up. The figure's

                  head is down with both hands bent and wrapped around his head. His left elbow may

                  rest on a scroll. A scroll appears above Sleep's left wing. Another scroll extends

                  upward and to the left above the rainbow-like circle of light. Five small figures

                  appear near the scroll in the upper portion of the design. Furthest left, a figure

                  flies or hovers with its body nearly horizontal and its left leg bent to the

                  right. The figure's left arm is extended to the left; the figure may touch the

                  scroll. Above and to the right, a figure lays or reclines on the scroll. The

                  figure appears to face right. To the right, a gowned(?) figure kneels on the

                  scroll, facing left. To the right, a figure flies or hovers with its body

                  horizontal. Below and to the right, a nude figure is seen from behind with his or

                  her right arm raised at 135 degrees; he or she may touch the scroll. Leafy trees

                  appear in the upper corners of the design; the tree to the right has visible

                  branches that arch to the left. Wash in the upper portion of the design suggests

                  sky.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="CD"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>Milton</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>eyes closed</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>lying</characteristic><characteristic>supine</characteristic><characteristic>sleeping</characteristic><characteristic>body horizontal</characteristic><characteristic>legs crossed</characteristic><characteristic>left foot</characteristic><characteristic>arms at side</characteristic><characteristic>arms resting</characteristic><characteristic>arms crossed</characteristic><characteristic>arms on lap</characteristic><characteristic>palms down</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing up</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Milton lies supine on the ground in the lower portion of the design.

The

                  trunks stand at the left and right borders of the design, with the branches

                  arching up towards the center; the branches are intertwined above Milton's head.

                  Milton wears a gown trimmed with fur or hair. His arms are raised horizontally

                  with the palms held vertically and the fingers spread. A halo of radiance emanates

                  from his head. Milton's eyes are raised and his is mouth open; he may look towards

                  the constellations above. An open book rests on a stone to the right of Milton;

                  coloring on the stone suggests moss. To the right, a candlestick rests on

                  another stone or ledge; a candle burns in the holder. The ground below Milton is

                  covered with grass. Other leafy vegetation appears to the left and right of a

                  partially buried figure lower left. Several flowering plants are visible to the left of

                  Milton; roses or other buds appear to the left and right of an embracing couple

                  and lilies grow further to the left. Two rosebuds appear below Milton. Two gowned

                  figures representing flower spirits stand to the left of Milton. The figure to the

                  right is likely female; her companion is of indeterminate gender. The figures are

                  embracing and share a kiss. Three gowned spirits hover or fly around the

                  embracing couple; two of the figures may hold and play pipes or trumpets, while the lowest (on the left) may hold and play a lyre. A gowned

                  female stands in the lower left corner of the design; she may represent a flower

                  spirit. She leans or arches to the left with her head turned to the right. Her

                  right arm is raised vertically with the palm held vertically. Her left arm is

                  raised at 45 degrees and she may hold or pull the partially buried figure to the

                  right. The buried spirit faces left in profile with his or her head turned

                  slightly up; the spirit's arms are raised at 135 degress and reach toward the

                  gowned female to the left. A nude female spirit lies on her side in the lower

                  right corner of the design; only her upper body is visible and she may be

                  partially buried in the earth. Her right arm is bent with her hand on her breast

                  and her fingers spread. She may be the mother of the two infants below.  She may be offering her right breast to feed the infant on the left. The infant

                  futhest left is seen from behind and faces up; his or her left arm is raised

                  vertically and reaches toward the female spirit. The infant to the right faces

                  left in profile and suckles at the female's left breast. Four gowned female

                  spirits sit or kneel above and to the left of Milton. The figure furthest right

                  kneels in a contracted position bent to the right with her head down and her right

                  arm bent around her head. The three figures to the left raise their arms

                  vertically above their heads. There may be a fifth, indistinct figure further

                  left. Three gowned female spirits kneel on a cloud above and to the right of

                  Milton. Five constellations appear in the night sky; perhaps eighteen stars in all

                  are visible. The constellation furthest left represents Cancer. A nude figure with

                  short hair sits on a crab's back; the figure's legs are bent and spread apart. The

                  figure is seen from behind. His or her left arm may be bent upward; the right arm

                  is not pictured. The crab faces forward with two claws extended downward and at

                  least three legs visible. The constellation second from the left represents

                  Gemini; the twins Castor and Pollux hover with their legs extended slightly to the

                  right. Both figures are nude. The figure to the left faces forward with his right

                  arm raised at 135 degrees. The figure to the right is seen from behind and faces

                  away with his right arm raised horizontally; he may hold a shield. Each figure

                  holds his left arm at his side; they may touch or hold hands. The constellation

                  third from the left represents Orion. The figure is apparently nude, but clearly

                  wears a belt of three stars. He faces forward with his head turned slightly to the

                  right. Orion's left leg is bent and drawn up; his right leg is obscured. The

                  figure's arms are raised at 135 degrees; a cloth or other drapery appears over his

                  left arm and he holds a sword in his right hand. The constellation fourth from the

                  left represents Taurus. Only the head and front legs of the bull are pictured; the

                  bull's legs are bent as if it is running. The bull has two short horns, and its

                  eyes are pictured as stars. The constellation furthest right represents Aries; the

                  ram sits or lays facing right. A single curved horn is visible, and it may have a

                  tail. The body of the ram is obscured by a shepherd wearing a brimmed hat. The figure may be nude and seen

                  from behind; his or her body faces left with the head turned to the right. The

                  figure's left leg is bent and drawn up; the right leg is extended downward. The

                  shepherd's left arm is bent and the figure holds a shepherd's crook with his or

                  her left hand. The figure's right arm is raised at 45 degrees and may touch the

                  ram.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="CD"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>old</characteristic><characteristic>Milton</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>eyes raised</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>mouth open</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>fur</characteristic><characteristic>sitting</characteristic><characteristic>left foot</characteristic><characteristic>arms raised horizontally</characteristic><characteristic>palms vertical</characteristic><characteristic>halo</characteristic><characteristic>radiance</characteristic><characteristic>beams of light</characteristic><characteristic>fingers spread</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Milton, now in age, sits in a cave in the lower portion of the design.
