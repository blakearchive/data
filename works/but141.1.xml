The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of a digital edition of forty-seven monochrome wash drawings created by Blake between c. 1774 and c. 1786.  
<lb/>
<lb/>
The use of monochrome washes to tint a pencil or pen and ink drawing offered eighteenth-century artists several advantages. They could register gradations in tone, from the white of the untouched paper to jet black, without the more time-consuming use of actual colors. No further work was required if the wash drawing was intended as a preliminary for an uncolored engraving. A monochrome wash could also be used to underlie subsequent applications of water colors, thereby darkening selected areas to create the illusion of depth or cast motifs in shadow.  
<lb/>
<lb/>
As the works presented here show, Blake made full use of monochrome washes from his earliest years as an artist. When assigned by his engraving master, James Basire, to record tombs in Westminster Abbey c. 1774-75, Blake applied black and gray washes to tint many of his drawings (Objects 1-5). These carefully executed works could then be used as preliminaries for subsequent engravings by Basire’s workshop.
<lb/>
<lb/>
Blake’s monochrome washes during his first decade as an independent artist and engraver include several interrelated groups. The seven drawings of figures from Michelangelo’s Sistine ceiling (Objects 37-43) demonstrate how copying engravings of works by Renaissance masters helped Blake learn postures and gestures he would later use in his own compositions. Other drawings provide visual evidence of how Blake developed a design from early sketches to highly finished water colors or engravings. The recto/verso drawings, <hi rend="i">Two Sketches for “Joseph Making Himself Known to His Brethren”</hi> (Objects 34 and 35), are preliminaries for the finished water color in the Fitzwilliam Museum, one of three illustrations of the biblical story of Joseph that are among Blake’s finest pictorial works of the 1780s. The three Joseph water colors are in the Archive along with a water color preliminary for <hi rend="i">Joseph Ordering Simeon to be Bound</hi>. The evolution of one of Blake’s earliest original book illustrations, a frontispiece for Thomas Commins’ <hi rend="i">Elegy Set to Music</hi> of 1786, can be traced through three variant wash drawings (Objects 45-47) and a pencil sketch also in the Archive. The four wash versions of <hi rend="i">The Good Farmer</hi> reproduced here (Objects 16-19), in addition to two pen and ink drawings of the subject previously added to the Archive, show the complex ways Blake played variations on a theme as he worked toward a final version. No such finished work is known, and thus these drawings are our only record of Blake’s engagement with this subject. Similarly, for <hi rend="i">War Unchained by an Angel, Fire, Pestilence, and Famine Following</hi>, an untraced work Blake exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1784, we have only a preliminary study (Object 6).
<lb/>
<lb/>
Blake’s illustrations to his poem <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> of c. 1789 are among his most accomplished monochrome wash drawings. These have been published in the Archive as an independent group coordinated with the <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> manuscript.

                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>The subject of this drawing has been identified as the encampment of Robinson Crusoe, the protagonist of Daniel Defoe's 1719 novel. In the lower left-hand quarter is a circular palisade constructed with stakes, some of which have sprouted into small trees. Their branches merge above the structure, creating a canopy of leaves. A small patch of indeterminate vegetation appears on the ground at the palisade's base, around its right side. Further to the right, a small ladder leans against the wall. Its sides and eight rungs appear to be made of wood. The ground around the palisade is otherwise bare. Above the center of the structure three straight lines merge into a point, perhaps suggesting the edge of a roof behind the leafy canopy. Behind the palisade, occupying most of the design's background, is a large rock formation. At left the rock forms a wall behind the palisade, and several trees spring outward in different directions from a ledge near the center of the design. Furthest left are three palm trees: one that shoots upward at nearly 135 degrees, and two that extend horizontally toward the design's left edge. Each tree has many pointed leaves; the lower two have segmented trunks and appear to bear coconuts. Above and to the right of the three palms is a large deciduous tree with a thicker, curving trunk and much darker leaves. The tree leans leftward, over the palisade, and three branches extend to the right; two bear leaves. In the right half of the design, the rock formation separates into numerous round boulders that protrude at various angles from the rock wall. Between two of these is another deciduous tree, alike in shape and shade to the large one at left, though smaller. The tree leans right, outward from the rock formation, and it bears four large groups of leaves. From this tree's base extends the trunk of another, smaller tree that lays over toward the design's right border. The tree is nearly horizontal and may be damaged. It still bears leaves, however, and appears to be of the same deciduous variety as those around it. Above and to the right of these trees is a similar one; its lighter shade suggests that it is farther away. It has two main branches, each with large groups of leaves that extend nearly to the upper and right borders of the design. Behind the cluster of trees, beyond the edge of the rock formation, is a shadowy backdrop. Below the cluster of trees are more rounded boulders, which frame a small, rectangular door in the rock wall. The door appears to have a wooden frame; no doorknob is visible. Below and to the right of the door, in the design's lower right-hand corner, stands a small Crusoe figure. Left unfinished, in pencil alone, the figure stands with legs spread and arms crossed (left over right). He faces forward and may be striding forward and to the right with his left leg; his head may tilt downward and to the right, as if looking toward the ground near his left foot. The figure appears to be nude. Lines above and around his head may suggest motion or may represent a head covering of some sort. It has been suggested that Crusoe is shown discovering--or sowing--the barley and rice that sprang up from discarded husks of corn. These plants may be indicated by a series of short, scattered lines in the lower right corner.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>Below and to the right of the door, in the design's lower right-hand corner, stands a small Crusoe figure. Left unfinished, in pencil alone, the figure stands with legs spread and arms crossed (left over right). He faces forward and may be striding forward and to the right with his left leg; his head may tilt downward and to the right, as if looking toward the ground near his left foot. The figure appears to be nude. Lines above and around his head may suggest motion or may represent a head covering of some sort. It has been suggested that Crusoe is shown discovering--or sowing--the barley and rice that sprang up from discarded husks of corn.</illusobjdesc>
