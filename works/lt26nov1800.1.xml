                The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of electronic editions of our second installment of Blake's letters, the correspondence of 1800-1805, which includes his three years with patron William Hayley in the coastal village of Felpham, West Sussex, and the frightening months leading up to his trial for sedition.
                <lb/>
                The letters in this group supplement the Archive’s publication in November 2013 of Blake's illustrations to works by Hayley, including his <hi rend="i">Essay on Sculpture</hi>, the broadside ballad <hi rend="i">Little Tom the Sailor</hi>, <hi rend="i">The Triumphs of Temper</hi>, <hi rend="i">The Life and Posthumous Writings of William Cowper</hi>, and <hi rend="i">The Life of George Romney</hi>, along with the republication of Blake’s etched and engraved illustrations to <hi rend="i">Designs to a Series of Ballads, Written by William Hayley</hi> (1802) and Hayley’s <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi> (1805). Letters from this period track the downward spiral from the most hopeful moments of Blake’s anticipations of working for the beloved “hermit of Eartham” to the bitterness and resentment he ultimately felt for that “pickthank.” The letters also show Blake in the process of conducting routine business: with Hayley but also with his important London patron Thomas Butts and with the publisher-promoter Robert Hartley Cromek, who was destined to become a focus of anger and frustration in the next stage of Blake’s life.  <lb/><lb/>
                About ninety of Blake’s letters survive, an unknown fraction of the total. Several—ten in the present group of thirty-three—are known only from partial and full transcriptions in the second, expanded, edition of Alexander Gilchrist’s <hi rend="i">Life of William Blake</hi> (1880). Blake traveled seldom and not very far. His circle of correspondents was narrow and the geographical circuit small. But his modest body of correspondence comprises an absorbing, revealing miscellany of reports on work in progress alongside friendly and not so friendly exchanges on matters of practical and intellectual substance. Occasionally the letters burst out into visions that amalgamate, in a characteristic Blakean vein, homely details, intensely energized prose, and inspired poetry.&#160;    <lb/><lb/>
                The letters are, in any case, indispensable in preserving facts and contexts for his life and work that would be otherwise unknown and in showing him shift pragmatically from role to role in a very natural—and human—way, exposing facets of character and personality not always so apparent in his art. The letters feel closer to the exigencies of everyday life than any other works from Blake’s hand. He seldom puts pen to paper without interesting consequences for readers.   <lb/><lb/>
                The Archive now contains 136 fully searchable and scalable electronic editions of important manuscripts and series of engravings, color printed drawings, tempera paintings, water color drawings, including 90 copies of Blake's nineteen illuminated books—all in the context of full bibliographic information about each work, careful diplomatic transcriptions of all texts, detailed descriptions of all images, and extensive bibliographies.   <lb/><lb/>
                As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with the University of Rochester, the continuing support of the Library of Congress, and the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.

                    as part of Lot 12,803, which included Blake's letters to Hayley of 26 November
                    1800, 26 October 1803, 4 May 1804, 28 May 1804, 9 August 1804, 23 October 1804,

                    £52.10s.); probably bought by Alexander MacMillan as part of group
                    advertised by Quaritch in 1880 (see Bentley, "A Checklist of Publications and
                    Discoveries in 1995," *Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly* (Summer
                    2010), page 137n32); original manuscript untraced; letter only known from
                    printed transcription appearing in *Life of William Blake*
                    volume 1 (London: Macmillan, 1880).<lb/><lb/>The transcription of Blake’s letter
                    to William Hayley, 26 November 1800, was among the materials added in the
                    revised and expanded second edition (1880) of Alexander Gilchrist's *Life of William Blake, "Pictor Ignotus"* (London: Macmillan, 1863).
                    Blake's posthumous biographer Alexander Gilchrist died in 1861 before completing
                    his biography of Blake, which was finished by his wife, Anne Gilchrist, with
                    assistance from Dante Gabriel Rossetti and others (see also Bentley, *Blake Books*, pages 24-27).<lb/><lb/> The title page of the
                    1880 volume containing the letter reads: "LIFE / OF / WILLIAM BLAKE / WITH
                    SELECTIONS FROM HIS POEMS AND OTHER WRITINGS / BY / ALEXANDER GILCHRIST / OF THE
                    MIDDLE TEMPLE, BARRISTER-AT-LAW / AUTHOR OF "THE LIFE OF WILLIAM ETTY, R.A." //

                    book was printed by R. Clay, Sons, and Taylor, Bread Street Hill,
                    London.<lb/><lb/>Images, object notes, and transcriptions are from a copy in the
                    Rare Book Collection of the Wilson Library at the University of North Carolina
                    at Chapel Hill. The copy photographed was owned by Annie G. Holden, and is
                    inscribed "Annie G. Holden / Xmas 1880" in brown ink on the recto of the first
                    flyleaf; later in the library of Tatton Henry Bower of Yorkshire (1867-1931),
                    whose armorial bookplate is also attached; the Wilson Library purchased this
                    copy from the dealer Claude Cox in 1978.</note></provenance><repository><institution>Wilson Library</institution><addressline>CB#3936 Wilson Library</addressline><addressline>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</addressline><addressline>Chapel Hill, NC 27514-8890</addressline><addressline>United States</addressline><addressline>Telephone: 919-962-1143</addressline><addressline>E-mail, Reader Services: rbcref@email.unc.edu</addressline><addressline>URL: http://www.lib.unc.edu/rbc/</addressline><department>Rare Books, Special Collections</department><repositoryid label="Call number">PR4146 .G5 1880 C.1 V.1</repositoryid></repository></source><desc id="lt26nov1800.1.ltr.01" dbi="lt26nov1800.1.1.LT"><objtitle><title type="transcribed">Absorbed by the poets</title>, <objid><objnumber code="A1">Object 1 </objnumber></objid></objtitle><physdesc desclevel="brief"><objsize>20.1 x 11.9 cm.</objsize><objnote><p>Objects 1 and 2 include a transcription from a manuscript letter by Blake,
