To the left of center stands an old man, Zacharias, dressed in a richly adorned gown and hat, indicating his high status as a priest. He faces forward but turns his head to look at the figure to the right. He has long, white hair and a beard and his right foot is visible beneath the hem of his gown. In his hands he holds a braided rope or cord to which a censer is attached. Clouds of incense waft from the censer to the right and upward. To the right of center stands a male angel in a long gown. The angel Gabriel has large wings and a halo around his short, curly hair. His left foot is visible beneath the hem of his gown. He faces forward and looks to the left, presumably at Zacharias. He holds a golden scepter in his left hand, which is at his side. The scepter is topped with what resembles three crowns, one vertical and two horizontal; this motif calls to mind a fleur-de-lis or the trinity. His right arm is bent upward, as his right hand points up as well. In between the two figures, in the center of the design, is a stone(?) altar topped with flames. The fire appears to be fed by coal or charcoal, though it could be wood chips. The incense wafts up toward the fire and may rise above it, though the smoke visible above the flames may be from the fire itself. A coiled scroll-like design ornaments the top right side of the altar. On the left side of the image, to the left of Zacharias, stands a large, ornate, golden menorah. Seven lit candles top the structure. The branching candelabra is decorated with metalwork(?) in a floral design, with some fleur-de-lis shapes visible. At the base of the candelabra stand the images of two angels, each looking outward and down. Each angel has large wings, a long and flowing gown, long hair, and possibly an arm at its visible side. On the right side of the design, to the right of Gabriel, stands a table, perhaps made of brass or wood painted to appear golden. On top of the table stand two lidded jars or urns. The scene takes place in a darkened room, presumably inside the temple. At the top center of the image is a golden light that radiates outward and downward.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="AC"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>old</characteristic><characteristic>Zacharias</characteristic><characteristic>priest</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>right foot</characteristic><characteristic>hem</characteristic><characteristic>jewelry</characteristic><characteristic>censer</characteristic><characteristic>hat</characteristic><characteristic>crown</characteristic><characteristic>bell</characteristic><characteristic>arms at side</characteristic><characteristic>palm down</characteristic><illusobjdesc>To the left of center stands an old man, dressed in a gown and hat richly adorned with gold and jewels, indicating his high status as a priest.
