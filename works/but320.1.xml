"Triumphant Death" hovers above the stricken, his "Dart[s]" descending below each hand.  The curved form extending between his hands seems poised ambiguously between a bow and a scroll.  The figure far right, with a dagger in his left hand, may be a personification of Milton's "despair" who "tended the sick."</p><p>A title, "The House of Death Milton," is inscribed in pencil below the design, almost certainly not by Blake.</p></objnote><objsize>48.5 x 61.0 cm.</objsize><windowsize width="600" height="550"/></physdesc><illusdesc><illustration type="plate" location="E"><illusobjdesc>In the upper center of the design hovers a god-like figure, probably personified Death, in accord with the passage illustrated from Milton's <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi>.  His eyes are closed and he has an unusually long, flowing beard.  He hovers above or within a cloud.  Beneath his raised arms and hands appears a bow-shaped scroll (or scroll-like bow).  Arrow-like darts descend from his hands or the ends of the scroll.  Three figures lie in pain on a heavy woven mat below Death.  We see the head and upper body of a fourth figure proped up behind those lying on the mat.  All four are probably dying.  A figure along the right margin of the design stands, or walks towards the left, with his head hanging low, while holding a dagger in his left hand.  He may be a personification of "despair" in Milton's text.  In the middle distance, right side of the cloud, is a hunched-over figure whose hands clasp either side of his head.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>God</characteristic><characteristic>Death</characteristic><characteristic>old</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>upper body</characteristic><characteristic>eyes closed</characteristic><characteristic>cloth</characteristic><characteristic>spiky</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>arms raised horizontally</characteristic><characteristic>hands raised, palms down</characteristic><characteristic>fingers</characteristic><characteristic>shirt</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>hovering</characteristic><characteristic>blind</characteristic><illusobjdesc>An old man with long, spiky hair and an unusually long, flowing beard hovers in the upper center of, or is hovering just above, a cloud.  We see only his arms, hands, head, and enormous beard.  His arms are covered with cloth; he is probably wearing a shirt or gown.  His eyes are closed, or possibly sealed to indicate blindness, and his arms are raised horizontally with his palms facing down.  A bow-like scroll (or scroll-like bow) extends between his hands; he may be holding it.  The fingers of both hands are carefully delineated.  Behind his right hand, three arrow-like darts extend diagonally downward.  Two more darts descend from his left fingertips.  This god-like figure is probably a personification of Death, in accord with the passage illustrated in Milton's <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi>.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="object" location="E"><characteristic>cloud</characteristic><characteristic>arching</characteristic><characteristic>encircling</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A cloud appears below the top center figure, possibly supporting him.

His skin is dark.  He holds a dagger in his left hand with his forefinger along the blade.  His left arm is at his side.  The figure’s left ear is prominent.

While his head and upper body are bent towards the mat, the bottom half of his body (hips and below) faces the viewer; this is particularly true of the right leg, which lies in front of the left leg, crossing the left leg at the ankle.  The left arm is sharply bent upwards as his left hand grips his left shoulder.  The right arm is most likely bent as well, suggested by the right forearm visible underneath his torso (although the rest of the arm is obscured).  His right fingers are nestled between his left bicep and his left forearm (all four fingers are discernible).  Thus, his arms are wrapped around his upper body.  His face, as well as his twisted posture, express despair and pain.  He has short (?) curly hair.  He is probably diseased and dying.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="CD"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>supine</characteristic><characteristic>arching</characteristic><characteristic>rigid</characteristic><characteristic>pain</characteristic><characteristic>feet</characteristic><characteristic>drapery</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>partly nude</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>mouth open</characteristic><characteristic>despair</characteristic><characteristic>facing up</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>knees</characteristic><characteristic>ear</characteristic><characteristic>head bent back</characteristic><characteristic>eyes raised</characteristic><characteristic>dying</characteristic><characteristic>disease</characteristic><characteristic>lying</characteristic><characteristic>legs together</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The second man from the front on the mat lies supine.

He is nude, except for the small swatch of drapery over his left hip, covering his genitals.  His arms are not pictured.  The back of his head with long hair lies on top of the mat.  His face is facing to the left, although upside down.  The lower part of his right ear is visible.  His eyes may be rolled back in his head, or perhaps raised, and he is probably diseased and dying.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="C"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>pain</characteristic><characteristic>despair</characteristic><characteristic>short hair</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>eyes raised</characteristic><characteristic>drapery</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent at knee</characteristic><characteristic>knee</characteristic><characteristic>legs crossed</characteristic><characteristic>lying on side</characteristic><characteristic>dying</characteristic><characteristic>disease</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>huddled</characteristic><characteristic>twisted</characteristic><characteristic>feet</characteristic><characteristic>blanket</characteristic><characteristic>leg drawn up</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Along with the two front-most figures, the third male from the viewer on the mat lies on his right side and faces the viewer.  His eyes are turned upwards.  His facial expression suggests a mixture of despair and pain.  He has short, curly hair.  His right(?) knee is drawn up towards his chest, although the configuration of his legs is not easily determined.  His left leg may be crossed over his right, just below the right knee; both feet are prominent.  He appears to have a blanket or drapery wrapped around his torso.

Lines (veins?) on his face are prominent, as is his right ear.  He is probably half-sitting, half-lying, with his upper body propped up on his arms (or at least his right arm).  His right shoulder cradles his head, which is bent severely backwards.
