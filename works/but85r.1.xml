                    <illusobjdesc>Two seated figures, a female figure at left and a male figure at right, embrace in the center of this composition. The female figure sits with her legs bent beneath her and lower body facing left. However, her upper body is twisted to the right to embrace the male figure with her right arm, which is raised horizontally. She wears a gown, and perhaps also a necklace, and has long curly hair. Her face is very close to the male figure at right, and the pair may look at each other, touch, or kiss. The male figure sits with his legs bent beneath him at right and faces left. He has short curly hair and a beard and wears a long gown with additional drapery around his waist and back. His left arm is bent and raised horizontally to embrace the female figure around her right shoulder. His right arm appears to be wrapped around her body, and his right hand rests on the female figure's back or waist. A long cylindrical pillow rests on the ground behind the male figure at right, and a patterned carpet covers the ground beneath the pair. The background behind the two figures appear to be made of curtains or drapery with abstractly vegetative designs suggesting vines, branches, and leaves. Areas of dark coloring on the back of the male figure and in the upper right corner of the composition may suggest shadows.</illusobjdesc>
