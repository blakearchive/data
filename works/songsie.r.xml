   The William Blake Archive http://www.blakearchive.org is pleased to announce the publication of new electronic editions of <hi rend="i">The Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> Copies R and AA. Copy AA has been reproduced only once previously, as a microfilm many years ago; Copy R has never been reproduced before.<lb/><lb/><hi rend="i">Songs</hi> Copies R and AA are both in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, England. They join copies of <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> in the Archive from other printings: Copies C (1789/1794), F (1789/1794), L (1795), and Z (1826). Copies O and V, from 1795 and c. 1818 printings, are forthcoming.<lb/><lb/>
   The electronic editions have newly edited SGML-encoded texts and new images scanned and color-corrected from first-generation 4x5" transparencies; text and images are each fully searchable and supported by the Inote and ImageSizer applications described in our previous updates.<lb/><lb/>
   With the publication of these two titles, the Archive now contains 39 copies of 18 separate books, including at least one copy of every one of Blake's works in illuminated printing except the 100 plates of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> (forthcoming).<lb/><lb/>
   We are also pleased to announce that the Archive was recently named to the NEH's prestigious EDSITEment list of "Top Humanities Web Sites" http://edsitement.neh.gov/.<lb/><lb/>
   Copy R, printed and colored c. 1795, is of special interest because it was Blake's own copy and, with slight variations, provided the plate order for the last seven copies, printed between 1818 and 1827. This was the first time that Blake printed the <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> and <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> plates in the same session. All copies of <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> produced before Copy R—for example, Copies C and F in the Archive—were compiled from <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> impressions printed in 1789 (either from the raw sienna issue, as in Copy C, or green issue, as in Copy F) and <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> impressions printed in 1794 (either lightly color printed, as in Copy C, or heavily color printed while <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> was still in progress, as in Copy F). And Copy R marks the first time that Blake printed Plates 34-36 ("The Little Girl Lost" and "The Little Girl Found") as <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> plates; in the earlier copies of <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> he printed them as <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> poems and transferred them to <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> at the time of compilation.<lb/><lb/>
   Though Blake printed the <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> and <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> plates in the same session, he apparently meant for them to be separate works. He printed the plates in various shades of greenish and grayish black ink, but did not print the combined title plate, and stabbed and numbered the two parts as separate volumes. He produced Copy R, in other words, almost exactly as he advertised its two separate sections in his prospectus of October 1793, where <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> was not advertised as such, but rather as "Songs of Innocence" and "Songs of Experience," with each part listed as a separate work and described as "Octavo, with 25 designs, price 5s." Almost exactly, but not quite, because Copy R was printed on one side of folio-size leaves and its <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> had only twenty-four designs, since it did not include "To Tirzah," which had not yet been executed, or plate a, which had been used as a tailpiece in Copies B-D.<lb/><lb/><hi rend="i">Songs</hi> Copy R now has the combined title plate and "To Tirzah," but both were inserted late. "To Tirzah" may have been printed and inserted with the copy's impression of "The Tyger," which is watermarked "J Whatman / 1808" (the only impression so marked). Both plates were printed in a solid black ink, not the greenish and grayish black of the other plates, and are numbered sequentially as part of <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> (1-25) and thus must have been inserted before this numbering and the numbering, in the same style and medium, of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> (1-28). The combined title plate was also printed in this solid black ink, but it is unnumbered and may have been printed and/or added later, though almost certainly before Copy R was sold to Linnell in 1819, by which time the pages had been given four framelines, the <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> pages had been renumbered 29-53 to continue the sequence of numbers in <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi>, and many <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> impressions had been recolored.<lb/><lb/>
   Copy R was produced with <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> Copy A as part of a set of illuminated books printed on large paper, approximately 38 x 27 cm., the size of the "I Taylor" paper it shares with Copy A. It was trimmed to 30 x 22 cm. when bound to match Linnell's other illuminated books. Copy R joins other works from the large-paper set now in the Archive (<hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> Copy F, <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> Copy D, <hi rend="i">There is No Natural Religion</hi> Copy L, <hi rend="i">All Religions are One</hi> Copy A, <hi rend="i">America, a Prophecy</hi> Copy A, and <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> Copy G) and forthcoming (<hi rend="i">The First Book of Urizen</hi> Copy B and <hi rend="i">Europe, a Prophecy</hi> Copy H).<lb/><lb/><hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> and <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> were printed together as a single, combined work in 1826 to form <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> Copy Z, which is in the Archive, and Copy AA. Both copies sold for L5.5s., half what Blake listed <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> for in an 1827 letter. Both Copies Z and AA were printed in the same orange ink Blake used ca. 1818 and 1821-22 (works from these sessions include <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> Copy O, which is in the Archive, and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> Copy E, <hi rend="i">America, a Prophecy</hi> Copy O, <hi rend="i">Europe, a Prophecy</hi> Copy K, <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> Copy P, and <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> Copy G, each of which will enter the Archive within the next year). Like the books produced in these sessions, both copies were given single red framelines, though the pen and ink page numbers (1-54) were placed outside rather than inside the frameline.<lb/><lb/>
   In the future, with the release of our revised site interface, users will be able to instantly compare impressions from various copies of an illuminated book within the same browser window. At the moment, users need to open other browser windows to make such comparisons. Doing so with impressions from Copies AA and Z, however, is instructive and well worth the effort. Impressions from the same plate, though printed and colored in the same style, often appear quite different if the text was rewritten or an image was strengthened in pen and ink (either black or red). But this characteristically Blakean bounding line was usually necessitated by an otherwise illegible text or undifferentiated images. Overall, the impressions in Copy AA were better printed and required less pen and ink salvaging than those used to form Copy Z.

vines around their loins—bend severely to the left, their bodies curved
away from a 
powerful burst of flames and smoke(?) that extends all the way across
the plate from the right

paradise in Eden.  Eve, the 
long-haired lower figure, bends almost to a prone position, as if she has
been crawling on the 
ground.  Her head is twisted toward the viewer.  Her right leg is drawn
up under her and her left is 
extended behind.  Her visible arm is extended under her head on the
grassy(?) ground.  Adam's body is
bent 
over hers.  His legs are spread and he clasps his head in his arms.  The
two bent bodies and the 
flames form concentric arches.  The flames rise to the top right corner of
the plate and through the spaces between the lines of the title and
subtitle.  The area above the third line of the title is colored to suggest
sky, perhaps with clouds.  An ascending bird 
spreads its wings in the area to the right of the first "Of" (line 3).  The initial "S,"
the "N," and the final 
"S" of "SONGS" (line 2) have extravagant vine-like extensions.  A tiny figure,
apparently facing forward or right, with right arm raised vertically,
stands on the lower, vine-like extension of the first "S" of "SONGS."  In
this copy, the figure is linked to the vegetation sprouting from the first
"S" of the title.  To the right, also on the "S," is a seated figure, facing

in her arms.  A small child stands between her and the next adult to the
left.  In the center, the tallest figure in the group, perhaps "Old John with
white hair" (Object 6, line 13), points forward with his right hand.  A boy
to the left, who faces away from the viewer, holds a bat at his side with

The dominant form is perhaps the vegetation with flame-like leaves that
swirls in the spaces of the right margin (with a more conventional leaf or
two at bottom right), underneath the title (line 2), and down the left margin. 
Tendrils extending from both margins help separate the stanzas from one
another.  The vine right of the final stanza on the plate has several loops
suggesting a spiral.  The vine full of leaves and flowers(?) that extends
across the top of the plate above the title and fills the top right corner
and the space right of the first stanza is distinct from the flame-like 
vegetation that dominates the rest of the plate.  Extensions of letters in
the title contribute to both forms of vegetation: the initial "A" and "C" to
the vine above, the "S" to both.  In the text of the poem, occasional
letters have modest decorative extensions, and there are a few bits of

flame-like leaves, apparently rooted at right in the strip of grassy ground
that runs across the bottom of 
the plate, grows along the ground under the last stanza and then up the
left margin.  Between 
stanzas three and four the plant forks.  One part continues up the left
margin and ends under the 
title.  Another part of the plant curves between the third and fourth
stanzas and crosses into the 
right margin, curves back over the title and ends in an upward flourish at
top left.  The large plant 
is encircled in its upper reaches by a leafy vine that is rooted, like the
plant itself, at the bottom 
right corner.  From there the vine climbs up the right margin behind the
standing figure and then, 
after arching over the figure's head, onto the flame-like plant, which the
vine continues to climb 
until it terminates just left of the title.  A second vine, much shorter,
appears in front of the plant at the bottom of the plate, left of the
reclining figure.  There are several human 
figures on and around the plants: (at top left) a gowned female with long
hair walks right; a second gowned female, probably with long hair,
floats behind her, pointing right; two figures kneel side by side, facing
right, hands raised in prayer; (at bottom right) a gowned figure stands,
with an arm extended, perhaps touching the left hand of a nude male
figure to the left, who reclines 
with his right arm braced for support, his left raised vertically; below and
in front of this pair, a 
third figure, perhaps a nude female, reclines, supported on her left arm.

The other three are in the area of the title: lying, presumably 
sleeping, on the left stroke of the initial "A"; sitting, perhaps reading, in
the "D" of "Dream"; and floating or flying, with arms raised

designs.  Beneath its text, beside a tree with leafless branches that
occupies the right margin, are two figures.  At the base of the tree a
gowned female with long hair reclines, her head apparently supported by
her bent left arm.  She may be the pretty rose tree of the poem.  At her
feet, facing right and to the right of a plant or tuft of grass, is a second
figure, wearing tights and sitting (or perhaps kneeling) hunched over in a
contracted position.  This may be the male speaker of the poem who
"tend[s]" the rose-tree "by day and by night" (line 9).  He holds his
visible hand around his head or on his right shoulder.  In the sky
between the two figures are one large and nine small flying birds.  A
vine with several leaves springs from the lower right corner of the design
and rises right of the second stanza.  A plant of some sort grows between
the contracted figure and the left margin.  Rose, and yellow washes
