                    <illusobjdesc>The design illustrates I Samuel 17:28, 32-37.  Three male figures occupy the foreground of the composition.  The leftmost figure, who is nude except for a swath of drapery over his right shoulder and a cloak(?) dangling behind him, extends his left arm with palm facing out, fingers spread.  He turns his head right toward the other two figures, both of whom have curly hair and beards.  The middle figure, who is crowned, raises his right arm at 135 degrees with his palm facing out. His other arm is bent slightly in front of his torso; he also wears drapery over his right shoulder though it is unclear if the rest of his body is clothed.  Immediately to his left, the third central figure wears a long gown and extends both arms downward, palms facing out.  This trio may be David (left), Saul (middle), and David's brother Eliab (right) in the moment Saul accepts David's request to fight Goliath.  There are two additional figures standing far right and facing to the left, executed in pencil only.  Two figures in pencil appear between David and Saul.  The look up and to the right, toward Saul.  Three heads appear above them.</illusobjdesc>

The leftmost figure, who has curly hair and is nude except for a swath of drapery over his right shoulder and a cloak(?) dangling behind him, stands or perhaps walks right.  His body faces forward but he turns his head to look right at the two figures across from him. His mouth is open, suggesting he may be speaking.  His left arm is raised at 45 degrees with palm facing out and fingers spread.  His right arm is by his side; he may hold an indistinguishable object in his right hand.  This figure may be David, shown in the moment Saul accepts David's request to fight Goliath (I Samuel 17: 32-7).</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>In addition to the central trio of figures, there are two lightly sketched figures near the right side of the composition.  Though the details of these figures are relatively indistinct, they both appear to stand facing left wearing long gowns.  The figure at right frowns deeply and appears to bend his left arm in front of his chest.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>Two male figures appear between David and Saul, outlined only in pencil.  They are bearded and face up and to the right, apparently looking at Saul.  Only their upper bodies and heads are clearly delineated, although a few lines below suggest legs.  They may be standing.  A third figure is suggested between these two and Saul.  Three heads are outlined above this group.</illusobjdesc>
