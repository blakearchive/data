                The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of fully searchable and scalable electronic editions of the following works related to Blake’s development of his illustrations to Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>: Preliminary Sketches for Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, listed under Drawings and Paintings, Pencil Sketches; Preliminary Drawings for Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, listed under Drawings and Paintings, Monochrome Wash Drawings; and Preliminary Illustrations to Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, listed under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.<lb/><lb/>
                In addition, we are republishing the following works, previously presented in our Preview mode, to make their designs fully searchable: Robert Blair, <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, the 1808 book listed under Commercial Book Illustrations, Designed by Blake and Engraved by Other Engravers; <hi rend="i">Deaths Door</hi>, listed under Separate Plates and Plates in Series, Designed and Engraved by Blake; and Illustrations to Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, the series of twenty finished designs, listed under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.<lb/><lb/>
                Taken together, these works in a variety of media present a comprehensive overview of one of Blake’s major projects as an illustrator and exemplify his working methods as he developed rough sketches into finished water colors.  The evolution of any one design can be traced via links presented under Related Works in the Archive on the pull-down menus, lower left on the main viewing page for each work. <lb/><lb/>
                In October 1805, Blake was commissioned by the engraver and would-be publisher Robert H. Cromek to prepare forty drawings illustrating Robert Blair's <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, a popular "Graveyard" school poem first published in 1743.  Cromek originally planned to select twenty of these designs for a deluxe edition of the poem.  Blake launched into the project with great enthusiasm, rapidly sketching out his illustrations in pencil, developing some into wash drawings, and then producing a group of more finished water colors for presentation to Cromek.  In a first prospectus of November 1805, Cromek names Blake as both the designer and engraver of fifteen designs.  Blake etched one image, <hi rend="i">Deaths Door</hi>, in white-line, but Cromek rejected it.  The dark power of the print appeals to modern tastes, but was far from fashionable in the early nineteenth century.  In a second prospectus, also of November 1805, Cromek announced that Louis Schiavonetti would engrave twelve designs for the new edition.  Blake had lost the potentially lucrative commission to engrave his own designs; his relationship with Cromek descended into anger and argument.  In spite of their disagreement, Cromek included a portrait of Blake as a frontispiece to the volume, published in 1808.  Cromek promoted the book aggressively and the illustrations to <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> became Blake's best known work through much of the nineteenth century. <lb/><lb/>

Blake began to compose his illustrations to Blair's poem in the fall of 1805, but apparently he did not begin to work on this alternative title page design until early 1806.

At the top right corner of the image is a nude figure facing forward, down, and right. It is most likely male. His body is horizontal with his legs together and he appears to be bald. He looks down. His arms are raised horizontally relative to his torso with his right arm bent. He may be hovering. He holds scales in his right hand. He may be a personification of judgment or justice. To the right of the center oval is a series of sketchy circles that may represent a nude, bald figure, sitting and facing right and slightly forward. Its legs may be bent and drawn up. In the bottom right corner of the image is a series of circles and lines that may represent at least five figures. In the bottom left corner of the image is a group of five figures. A central nude female figure, perhaps with long hair, stands or hovers facing forward and slightly left. Her head is bent back to look up. Her arms are raised horizontally, palms up. Her legs are together and may be bent back a little. To the left of the central figure are three heads, facing forward. To the right of the central figure is one head, facing forward. To the left of the  oval at the center of the image is a nude male(?) figure, hovering and facing away. His legs are extended back and bent. His body is twisted so that his lower body faces down, his torso faces away, and his head looks down and to the right. His left arm is raised at 135 degrees, relative to his body, and bent. His right arm is at his side and bent upward. He appears to hold a sword in his right hand. Two circles to the left of the central oval may represent heads or clouds. In the top left corner of the image hovers a nude figure of indeterminable gender, facing down and right. Its legs may be together and bent. Its arms may be raised horizontally relative to its body, and bent. Above the central oval are four circles that may represent heads or clouds, connected to a swirling line. In the top right corner of the image are lines that may indicate a gowned figure, standing or walking and facing right and away. It may have its head down. A wavy line extends from the bottom left corner to the scales on the right edge of the design. This may represent clouds or the top of a cliff or mound of earth.</illusobjdesc><component type="object" location="E"><characteristic>circle</characteristic><illusobjdesc>At the center of the image is an oval, presumably where the title would have been printed. </illusobjdesc></component><component type="figure" location="BD"><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing down</characteristic><characteristic>body horizontal</characteristic><characteristic>prone</characteristic><characteristic>legs together</characteristic><characteristic>bald</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised horizontally</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent</characteristic><characteristic>hovering</characteristic><characteristic>flying</characteristic><characteristic>floating</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>scales</characteristic><characteristic>Justice</characteristic><illusobjdesc>At the top right corner of the image is a nude figure facing forward, down, and right.
