At the bottom center of the
                        design stands a nearly nude Christ, facing forward and looking down. He
                        wears only a loincloth. His left leg is bent backward and on tiptoe, and his
                        arms are bent at his sides with his hands together in a gesture of prayer.
                        He has long, slightly curly hair and a beard. A suffusion of light surrounds
                        his legs and head, where it forms a slight halo. To the left of Christ,
                        facing away but looking up, is John the Baptist. He wears a furry animal
                        skin belted around his waist like a toga. He has short, curly hair and a
                        beard. He raises his arms at 135 degrees, palms up and fingers spread. From
                        his right hand, he drops water onto Christ's head to baptize him. His mouth
                        is partly open; he may be speaking or praying. His right leg is bent and on
                        tiptoe. To the left of John the Baptist kneels a group of five figures. The
                        frontmost figure in the group is an old man with long hair and a beard. He
                        is gowned and bends forward, facing right and down. His right leg and his
                        right arm are both visible and bent. Behind the old man, the leftmost figure
                        is that of a gowned woman who appears to wear her hair in a bun. She faces
                        right and slightly forward, and may be looking at John the Baptist or
                        Christ. Her mouth may be slightly open. The figure immediately to the right
                        of the woman is a female(?) child, possibly with long hair. She looks to the
                        right and forward. The rightmost figure behind the old man is another
                        female(?) child, probably with long hair. Only the top of her face and head
                        are visible. She looks down and to the right. Kneeling to the right of the
                        old man is what appears to be a nude boy with short, curly hair. His right
                        leg is bent under him, while his left leg is bent upward, so that his right
                        foot is flat against the river bottom. He faces to the right and slightly
                        forward. His arms appear to be at his side and bent upward. He may have his
                        hands together in a gesture of prayer or supplication. In the bottom left
                        corner of the design stands a group of four figures, perhaps a family. The
                        leftmost figure is that of a gowned man with short, curly hair and a beard.
                        He faces away and looks up to his right. His right arm is at his side but
                        bent, the palm vertical and fingers spread in a gesture of surprise. Both of
                        his feet are visible beneath the hem of his gown and may be slightly on
                        tiptoe. The figure standing second from the left in this group is a gowned
                        woman with long, curly hair. She may be wearing a veil over her hair. Her
                        arms are at her sides but bent upward, with her hands together in a gesture
                        of prayer. She faces right and forward, looking slightly upward. The figure
                        standing second from the right is likely a child, given its height, though
                        its gender is indeterminable. It wears a gown and faces forward, looking up
                        and to the right. Its left arm is raised between the vertical and 135
                        degrees, palm up. The rightmost figure of the group is a child, probably
                        female, with long, curly hair. She wears a gown, the hem of which swirls
                        around her calves. Her left foot is on tiptoe, and she faces away, looking
                        up and to the right. Her arms are raised vertically, palms up. To the right
                        of Christ kneel two figures, most likely a mother and her child. The child
                        kneels, facing left and looking down. He (?) has short, curly hair and may
                        be nude. His arms are bent upward with his hands together in a gesture of
                        prayer or supplication. To the right kneels a gowned woman facing left and
                        looking down. Her hair is pulled back in a bun. She bends forward, almost
                        hunched over. Her arms are wrapped around her child, with her fingers
                        interwoven, perhaps in a gesture of prayer or supplication. In the bottom
                        right corner of the design stands a group of four gowned figures. The
                        leftmost figure is a child, perhaps female, with long, curly hair. She faces
                        away, but looks up and to the left. Her left leg is bent backward at the
                        knee and her left foot is on tiptoe. Both feet are visible beneath the hem
                        of her gown. Her arms are at her sides but bent upward, palms out as though
                        in a gesture of surprise. The figure standing second from the left is an old
                        man with long hair and a beard. He faces left and looks down. His arms are
                        bent upward with his hands together in a gesture of prayer or supplication.
                        The figure standing second from the right is a man with long hair and a
                        beard. He faces left and looks up. The rightmost figure of this group is an
                        old man his long hair and a beard. He faces left and looks up. His arms are
                        at his sides and bent upward, with his palms vertical but not touching. This
                        gesture suggests either surprise or prayer. Both his feet are visible
                        beneath the hem of his gown. All seventeen figures at the bottom of the
                        design kneel or stand in a river or stream, most likely the Jordan River.
                        The river winds through a landscape in the background with a small mountain
                        or large hill on either side of the composition. On the left bank of the
                        river are a number of leafy trees and perhaps some grass. Trees and other
                        indeterminate vegetation are visible on the right river bank as well. Two
                        flocks of sheep graze along the riverbank on the left and just below the
                        mountain on the left. A small building, probably a house, is visible at the
                        base of the left mountain, with a chimney and at least one window. The sky
                        backing the scene may be slightly cloudy, with coloring that suggests a
                        sunrise or sunset. At the top center of the image is a golden radiance. In
                        the center of this radiance, facing down, flies a dove, likely representing
                        the Holy Ghost. To the left of the dove are at least 23 hovering or flying
                        figures. Some of these may be wingless angels, putti, or cherubs. The
                        leftmost figures in this group include three gowned adults, most likely
                        female, with flowered garlands or wreaths in their hair. Their bodies are
                        horizontal and face right, with one facing away. Two of these figures carry
                        infants in their right arms, which are bent and at their sides. The top
                        right grouping is of nude children, perhaps male and cherubs, putti, or
                        wingless angels, mostly facing right and down. The bottom right grouping
                        includes a number of figures with garlands or wreaths on their heads,
                        kneeling and facing right and down. To the right of the dove are at least 14
                        hovering or flying figures. Some of these figures may be wingless angels,
                        putti, or cherubs. The leftmost group appears to consist of nude,
                        cherub-like child figures, upside down and facing right. The bottom central
                        group contains mostly kneeling figures, facing left and down. The kneeling
                        figures may be gowned. The top central group is a pair of sketchy figures,
                        of indeterminable age and gender, embracing each other. The rightmost
                        grouping contains three adult female figures, with long, curly hair, facing
                        left and with their bodies horizontal. Two of these women carry nude
                        children in their arms, which are at their sides and bent to cradle the
                        children. Another nude child is seen from behind, raising its arms
                        vertically to greet the child to the right.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>Christ</characteristic><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>partly nude</characteristic><characteristic>loin cloth</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing down</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent at knee</characteristic><characteristic>tiptoe</characteristic><characteristic>arms at side</characteristic><characteristic>arms bent</characteristic><characteristic>hands together</characteristic><characteristic>praying</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>halo</characteristic><characteristic>radiance</characteristic><characteristic>aura</characteristic><illusobjdesc>At the bottom center of the design stands a nearly nude
