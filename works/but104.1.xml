                    <illusobjdesc>Two groups of warring angels led by Satan at left and Michael at right confront each other in the center of this composition. The largest figure on the right is the muscular male figure Michael who flies or hovers facing forward. Leaning to the left, he turns his head to face left and down to look toward Satan at left. Michael has long hair and is nude except for a thin strip of cloth or drapery that covers his right hip and genitals. His arms are bent and raised in front of his chest where he holds and extends a sword forward. His right leg is straight and his left is bent backward slightly. He may wear a shield on his back; alternatively, the shield could be held by the figure behind him at left. This figure, who appears to be male, hovers or flies behind Michael facing left. He appears to have short hair and raises his bent right arm while brandishing a sword. One of his legs is bent forward. An additional shield is visible in front of this figure at left. A group of four figures are distinct within a larger crowd of warring angels to the right of Michael in the upper right corner. The rightmost of these figures faces forward but twists his head to look right. He has short hair and may wear a gown or shirt. His right arm is bent and he holds a spear, which points to the left. The second figure from the right also faces forward but twists to look right. He has short curly hair. Only the head of the third figure from the right is visible. This figure faces left and may wear a helmet. The fourth figure in this group hovers directly above the rightmost figure and appears to face forward and wear a helmet. Many diagonal lines and circular forms in the upper right corner suggest a larger, though indistinct, crowd of warring angels bearing spears and shields. The largest figure leading the group of warring angels at left is Satan, who flies or hovers facing forward and right with head turned to look down, perhaps toward the pair of figures flying below him. He has long hair and a beard and is nude. His left arm is at his side and he may hold a shield in his left hand; his bent right arm is raised vertically to hold a spear aloft. He bends to the right and his left leg is bent and extended forward. A pair of figures fly in horizontal position facing right beneath Satan. The rightmost figure appears to be a nude male with a strip of drapery around his waist that extends below his right leg. He has long hair and his body is horizontal facing down. His head is raised to look right, perhaps toward Michael. His right arm is raised horizontally, and he holds a shield in his right hand. His left arm is raised horizontally and extended backward; he holds two arrows or small spears in his left hand. His right leg is bent backward and up. The second figure in the pair flies or hovers slightly behind the first figure and has a similar horizontal body position facing down. This figure's right arm appears to be extended forward and right with a shield in its right hand. Drapery is visible around this figure's waist. This figure, whose gender is indeterminate, turns its head back to look left and extends its left arm toward another figure at left. This short-haired figure flies in from the left side of the composition with body horizontal facing down with head turned away and left. Its right arm is bent and extended forward. Its bent left arm may be visible above its body; alternatively, a second figure with only its head and one arm visible, may fly or hover above this figure. A third male figure is visible above this figure or pair near the left margin. He flies or hovers facing right and has short hair and perhaps a beard. He holds a shield in front of his body. As on the right side of the composition, the indistinct bodies and weapons of several additional figures are visible behind and to the right of Michael in the left half of the design. All appear to face right. The clearest of these figures are two warring angels with bodies positioned horizontally directly right of Michael. The lower figure in the pair has short hair and an open mouth. He points a spear toward Michael and his warriors. The higher figure in the pair faces down and raises a sword behind his right shoulder with his bent right arm. A large banner or flag waves above the group of warring angels on the left side of the design.</illusobjdesc>
