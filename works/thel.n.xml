            <updatestmt>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of 
                <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel Copy N</hi>
                and 
                <hi rend="i">Enoch Walked with God</hi>
                , both in the Cincinnati Art Museum. We have also republished 
                <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi>
                Copy U with a more authoritative arrangement of the plates and an enhanced Copy Information page.     
                
                <lb/>
                <lb/>
                <hi rend="i">Thel</hi>
                is dated 1789 by Blake on the title page, but the first plate (Thel's Motto) and the last (her descent into the netherworld) appear to have been completed and first printed in 1790, while Blake was working on 
                <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>
                . Copy N, never before reproduced, was printed and colored c. 1818 along with Copy O. It is one of sixteen extant copies, ten of which are in the Blake Archive—including Copy O—and four of which are in
                preparation for future publication. Like Copy O, Copy N was printed in orange ink on Ruse &amp; Turners paper, watermarked 1815, beautifully colored, numbered by Blake in pen and ink, and bound with Thel's Motto as the last instead of the first of the book's eight plates. Unlike Copy O, its plates have a single orange line framing them. 
                
                <lb/>
                <lb/>
                Blake included the book in his advertisement &quot;To the Public&quot; of October 1793: &quot;The Book of Thel, a Poem in Illuminated Printing. Quarto, with 6 designs, price 3s.&quot; He listed it again in 1818, in a letter to Dawson Turner, in which he priced it for £2.2.0., the price for which Copy N almost certainly sold. This letter is also in preparation for future publication.
                
                <lb/>
                <lb/>
                <hi rend="i">Enoch Walked with God</hi>
                , at 17.5 x 24 inches, is one of Blake's largest early designs. It was executed c. 1780-85 in water colors and pen and ink over pencil and charcoal. It joins sixty-four other water color drawings in the Archive illustrating the Bible.  
                
                <lb/>
                <lb/>
                This is the first time that works from the Cincinnati Art Museum have been represented in the Archive. Accordingly, we are also publishing the museum's Blake collection list, which includes all of its original works by Blake, not just those published in the Archive, and joins the Collection Lists of over thirty other contributing institutions.
                
                <lb/>
                <lb/>
                Additionally, with this publication, the Archive has implemented a new feature on its main viewing page to enable users to rotate the image, a particularly salient feature for Blake's texts written upside down or vertically.
                
                <lb/>
                <lb/>
                The Archive has also updated its General and Specific Bibliographies, which now incorporate links to many Google Books.
                
                <lb/>
                <lb/>
                As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with the University of Rochester, the continuing support of the Library of Congress, and the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.                  </updatestmt>

                <etchednumbers>Blake etched numbers 1-6 on the copperplates of Objects 2-7 (Bentley plates 3-8).  Only those on Objects 3, 4, 6, and 7 are even minimally legible in this copy.</etchednumbers>
                <pennednumbers>Object 2 is numbered &quot;2&quot; top right, and Objects 6-8 are numbered 6-8 top right, in ink that matches the color of the printing ink.
                    <note>The pen and ink numbers were probably intended to supersede the etched numbers, but Blake did not complete the numbering of all plates, there being no pen and ink numbers on Objects 3 through 5.  The pencil numbers, 3-5 top right on Objects 3-5, are almost certainly not by Blake.  They may have been added by a binder who collated the plates and supplied the missing numbers.</note></pennednumbers>

                    <illusobjdesc>A slender tree, entwined with a vine, arches protectively over the title words and major pictorial motifs.  This combination of motifs and their position suggests a tombstone.  Four birds and a human figure soar in the sky; seven other human forms, one winged, rest or climb among the title letters.  Thel, wearing a long gown and holding a shepherd's crook, stands lower left and gazes at a nude man embracing a gowned woman around her waist.  The gowned woman raises her arms.  These figures seem to emerge from the large, bowl-like flowers lower center and right.  The leaves of this plant and a flower bud complete the design lower center and right. The design does not directly illustrate a scene in the text, but the figures embracing above the flowers may suggest the &quot;raptures&quot; (Object 4 [Bentley 5], line 13) of the Cloud and the &quot;fair eyed dew&quot; (Object 4 [Bentley 5], line 15) during their courtship.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Four human figures soar around the title-word &quot;Thel&quot;: a nude man reaching toward a large eagle, a nude man holding a sword and shield, and a gowned woman holding a small child in her outstretched arms.  Below, a fifth figure, a nude man, rests on a spiky leaf (or perhaps a tassel of grain) and looks up toward the child.  Spiraling vines and stylized flowers, perhaps lilies, spring from several of the title letters. One or two trees or vines grow up the far left margin.  Blake's coloring of this impression converts this text plate into a full-page design.  The design does not represent any specific incident in the text, but the man with shield and spear may be one of the &quot;thousand fighting men&quot; referred to near the end of the poem (Object 7 [Bentley 8], line 16).</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Thel stands beneath the arching branches of a tree, perhaps a birch or willow.  She bows slightly toward the personified Lilly who, with arms folded, bows more deeply toward Thel. Both females wear long gowns, ruffled along the hems.  A vine climbs lazily about the tree trunk.  The plant behind and to the right of the Lilly is probably a lily, perhaps the St. Bernard's lily.  Washes in the text area suggest a sky with clouds at sunrise or sunset.  A dark cloud frames Thel.  Blake's coloring of this impression converts this text plate into a full-page design.  The design illustrates the dialogue between Thel and the Lilly given in the text on this plate.  The moment pictured may be their parting, when &quot;the Lilly bowd her modest head&quot; (line 18).</illusobjdesc>

The hem of Thel's gown and the posture of the personified Cloud suggest a wind blowing from right to left. However, the position of these characters' long hair suggests a breeze in the opposite direction. The Worm, portrayed as an infant, rests in a bed formed by a lily plant. Several flowers on a single stem are pictured just to the left of the infant Worm. A large tree and spiraling vine dominate the right margin. The design would seem to illustrate the last two lines of verse on the previous plate and the first line of verse on this plate: &quot;The helpless worm arose, and sat upon the Lillys leaf, / and the bright Cloud saild on, to find his partner in the vale. / . . .

                    <illusobjdesc>Thel squats on the ground, arms folded, and looks at the personified Worm and Clod (or &quot;matron Clay&quot; [line 15]).  Her long hair cascades over her shoulders; the hem of her long gown billows around her.  The infant Worm extends both arms and looks at the Clod, a young, nude woman lying on the ground.  She may be reaching for her offspring. Right of Thel is a large plant with spiky leaves and two blossoms, one of which arches over Thel's head.  Left of Thel is another plant with similar leaves but no blossoms.  Blake has added water on the left and in the foreground, suggesting a river or lake.  Given this configuration, the figures may be on an island or peninsula.  At the bottom left, a small plant bearing leaves or flowers appears to grow in soil across the water from the central figures.  Washes beneath and on all sides of the text may indicate clouds.  Blake's coloring of this impression converts this text plate into a full-page design. The design may in part illustrate lines on the previous plate: &quot;The Clod of Clay heard the Worms voice, &amp; raisd her pitying head; / She bow'd over the weeping infant...&quot; (plate 5, lines 9-10).</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Three nude children ride on the back of a snake.  The front-most child, apparently a girl, holds a rein in her left hand that extends to the snake's open mouth.  His forked tongue is extended. Beneath the snake are a variety of vegetative forms, including leaves and roots.  &quot;The End&quot; (line 27) is written within a hollow formed by the ground and vegetation.  Washes in the text area suggest sky or clouds. Blake's coloring of this impression converts this text plate into a full-page design.  The design bears no direct relationship with any images or events in the text.</illusobjdesc>
