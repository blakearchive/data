                  Urizen, sits cross-legged on a large book in the center foreground.  Centered behind him is a pair of stone tablets with arched tops, like 
                  tombstones.  Indeterminate dark forms, perhaps an arching tree, appear above and on both sides of the tablets.  Lying on the ground to the man's left and right are two sets of quadrangular stone tablets or books or, 
                  alternatively, the ends of a single long tablet, perhaps a coffin lid.  The dark background, trees, and tablets 
                  taken together suggest a graveyard setting.  Beneath Urizen's feet is an open book.  The toes of his 
                  right foot emerge from his beard to mark his place in the book.  Tree roots sprout to left and right 
                  in the foreground beneath the book and tablets.  Holding a writing instrument in each hand and 
                  resting his arms on the tablets to his left and right, Urizen seems to be copying from the book onto 
                  the tablets.  The instruments may be quills, graphite pencils, or etching needles.  Publication information is centered beneath the book.  Blake inscribed another color printed impression of the design along "Which is the Way / The Right or the Left" (Butlin no. 261.1, Erdman page 673).</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>Urizen</characteristic><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>old</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>sitting</characteristic><characteristic>sitting cross-legged</characteristic><characteristic>contracted</characteristic><characteristic>legs crossed</characteristic><characteristic>eyes closed</characteristic><characteristic>eyes down</characteristic><characteristic>arms raised horizontally</characteristic><characteristic>arms resting</characteristic><characteristic>right foot</characteristic><characteristic>knees</characteristic><characteristic>writing</characteristic><characteristic>copying</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A fully gowned old man with long, flowing white hair and beard, presumably Urizen,

                  the right with her arms crossed in front of her and her hands
                  over her breasts.  Her hair appears to be drawn back in a bun,
                  yet a few strands of long hair curl down her back.  She might
                  be kissing a much smaller figure, probably also female.  The
                  second nude figure is seen from behind; her arms are extended
                  horizontally.  Her right foot is poised just above one of the two
                  flowers, probably marigolds, growing on a plant lower right.  Her
                  left leg is bent at the knee in a dance-like posture.  She seems
                  to hover in the air.  The kneeling figure is probably Oothoon,
                  the smaller figure probably the "nymph" who personifies the
                  marigold.  As the text on Plate 4 explains, "Oothoon wanderd in
                  woe, / Along the vales of Leutha seeking flowers to comfort her;
                  / And thus she spoke to the bright Marygold of Leutha's vale /
                  Art thou a flower! art thou a nymph! I see thee now a flower; /
                  Now a nymph!" (<hi rend="italics">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi>, Bentley Plate 4, Erdman Plate 1 pages 45-46).  Given this textual point of contact, 
                  the landscape is Leutha's Vale, also named in the text.
                  The hovering nymph may also be identified with Leutha—see 
                  "Leutha's flower" (*Visions of the Daughters of Albion*, Bentley Plate 3, Erdman plate iii page 45).  The earth on which the figure
                  kneels is colored as though covered with grass, moss, or lichens.  Bursts of 
                  radiance fill the sky; they would seem
                  to emanate from a sun just below the horizon on the right.  A beam of light may be emanating
                  from the marigold furthest to the right.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>female</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>young</characteristic><characteristic>Oothoon</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>kneeling</characteristic><characteristic>kissing</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>bun</characteristic><characteristic>leg bent at knee</characteristic><characteristic>bending forward</characteristic><characteristic>hands on breasts</characteristic><characteristic>arms crossed</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A young nude woman kneels on the ground and leans to
