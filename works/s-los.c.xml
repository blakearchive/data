            The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of electronic editions of <hi rend="i">The Song of Los</hi> Copies C and E, from the Morgan Library and Museum and the Huntington Library and Art Gallery, respectively. They join Copies A and D from the British Museum and Copy B from the Library of Congress, giving the Archive five of the six extant copies of this illuminated book.
            <lb/><lb/>
            
            The eight plates of <hi rend="i">The Song of Los</hi> were produced in 1795; all extant copies (A-F) were color printed in that year in a single press run. Divided into sections entitled "Africa" and "Asia," <hi rend="i">The Song of Los</hi> is the last of Blake's "Continental Prophecies" (see also <hi rend="i">America</hi> [1793] and <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> [1794], exemplary printings of which are in the Archive). Blake abandons direct references to contemporary events to pursue the junctures among biblical narrative, the origins of law and religion, and his own developing mythology. Adam, Noah, Socrates, Brama, Los, Urizen, and several others represent both historical periods and states of consciousness. The loose narrative structure reaches towards a vision of universal history ending with apocalyptic resurrection.
            <lb/><lb/>
            Plates 1, 2, 5, and 8 (frontispiece, title page, and full page designs) are color printed drawings, executed on millboards and printed in the planographic manner of—and probably concurrent with—the twelve Large Color Printed Drawings of 1795, which are also in the Archive. Plates 3 and 4, which make up "Africa," and Plates 6 and 7, which make up "Asia," were executed first, side by side on two oblong pieces of copper (Plates 3/4, 6/7). Initially designed with double columns in landscape format, the texts of the poems were transformed into vertical pages by printing the oblong plates with one side masked. In Copies C and E, Plates 5 and 8 are differently arranged: 8 follows Plate 1 and 5 is placed at the end in Copy C; 8 follows Plate 3 and 5 follows Plate 6 in Copy E.

            Like all the illuminated books in the Archive, the text and images of <hi rend="i">The Song of Los</hi> Copies C and E are fully searchable and are supported by our Inote and ImageSizer applications. With the Archive's Compare feature, users can easily juxtapose multiple impressions of any plate across the different copies of this or any of the other illuminated books. New protocols for transcription, which produce improved accuracy and fuller documentation in editors' notes, have been applied to all copies of <hi rend="i">The Song of Los</hi> in the Archive.
            <lb/><lb/>
            With the publication of these copies of <hi rend="i">The Song of Los</hi>, the Archive now contains fully searchable and scalable electronic editions of seventy copies of Blake's nineteen illuminated books in the context of full bibliographic information about each work, careful diplomatic transcriptions of all texts, detailed descriptions of all images, and extensive bibliographies. In addition to illuminated books, the Archive contains many important manuscripts and series of engravings, sketches, and water color drawings, including Blake's illustrations to Thomas Gray's <hi rend="i">Poems</hi>, water color and engraved illustrations to Dante's <hi rend="i">Divine Comedy</hi>, the large color printed drawings of 1795 and c. 1805, the Linnell and Butts sets of the <hi rend="i">Book of Job</hi> water colors and the sketchbook containing drawings for the engraved illustrations to the <hi rend="i">Book of Job</hi>, the water color illustrations to Robert Blair's <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, and all nine of Blake's water color series illustrating the poetry of John Milton.
            <lb/><lb/>
            As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the continuing support of the Library of Congress, and the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.

This would appear to be the most recent binding order before the stitching (see Bentley page 362) was removed and the plates separately matted.  This unusual sequence of plates was almost certainly not established by Blake and may have been created when this copy was bound, with two other illuminated books, early in the nineteenth century.  The evidence of offsets is ambiguous but suggests an earlier binding order of 2-7, 1, 8.  It is also possible that Blake’s original arrangement was the standard 1-8 sequence.

                  below the first "A" and the "F" of the heading and just left of, above, and below the final "A."  Below, with five lines of text intervening, is the lower half of 
                  what is probably a unified composition, particularly given the 
                  marginal vegetation linking them.  On the left is a nude young 
                  male, probably a shepherd boy, lying on the ground in a 
                  contracted posture and probably sleeping.  The downward-directed 
                  mouth of the serpent above may be threatening him.  The male's 
                  legs are drawn up and his head, with curly hair, rests face down 
                  on his left arm.  To the right is at least one sheep, also lying 
                  on the ground with its face on the left.  Further to the right 
                  may be more sheep plus some vegetation.  Above this area, and 
                  just below the final word of line 3, is a flying 
                  insect with bat-like wings.

the left.  Both faces express fear or horror.  The male is nude.  Both figures have their mouths open, as though speaking or uttering a

above the waist.  The female's hair is long, the man's curly.  
They appear to be fleeing from some unrepresented presence on the

man's head.  Her right arm is extended at 135 degrees, with the 
palm facing to the left as though fending off a pursuer.  The 
ground on which they run may be covered with low vegetation. A hill or mound of vegetation slopes upward in the immediate background beneath a dark sky; a distant mountain peak rises on the right.  Just 
above, in the cloud or text panel into which the woman's right

                  image.  Several figures, not very clearly defined, disport among 
                  the letters of the heading ("ASIA," line 1).  A seated figure, 
                  with at least the left leg drawn up, appears just left of the first letter.  
                  His head may be bent back or turned to the right.  Within the upper 
                  loop of the second letter, a figure clutches his head and falls 
                  head first.  In the lower part of this same letter, there may be 
                  a gowned figure hunched over and with its hands clutching its head.  
                  Two embracing(?) figures, poorly defined but probably a 
                  male and female, stride to the left just left of the lower part 
                  of the letter "I."  An ill-defined cluster of lines may be a 
                  seated figure at the lower parts of the final "A."  The sky 
                  behind the heading contains clouds; the pink and red coloring behind the heading suggests a sunrise or sunset.  Below, we see a great 
                  tree arching over from left to right.  In a cave-like niche below 
                  the tree are two figures, a nude male holding a gowned woman.  He 
                  squats or sits on the ground, apparently with his head lowered 
                  since we see only the curly hair on the top of his head.  The 
                  female's head and left arm fall downward; she may be dead. 
                  The dark green coloring to the left of the man and woman may be vegetation.
                  Undifferentiated vegetation continues down both margins of the 
                  text; some vine-like shapes intrude between lines of text and 
                  fill areas on the right of the text.  A nude figure, probably male, sits or kneels in an extremely 
                  contracted posture in the lower right corner of the plate.  His 
                  left leg is drawn up to his left shoulder.  His head is turned to 
                  the left (his face is not pictured); he clutches his lowered head 
                  with both hands.  He (or, perhaps, she) may have long hair.  </illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="A"><characteristic>sitting</characteristic><characteristic>leg drawn up</characteristic><characteristic>head bent back</characteristic><characteristic>facing up</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A small figure with at least the left leg drawn up to the chest

                  association, the woman may be a queen.  His eyes are open and he 
                  faces forward.  He has long hair and a beard.  He is more seated than lying on his blossom, with 
                  his upper body propped up with his right arm.  He holds a scepter 
                  in his left hand.  The night sky in the distance contains indications of stars.  The design is based loosely on a 
                  monochrome wash drawing, now usually attributed to Blake's 
                  brother Robert, in Blake's Notebook, page 5.  There is also a 
                  separate water color of the design by William Blake (private 
                  collection).  The two figures have traditionally been identified 
                  as Oberon and Titania, although the relevance of Shakespeare's <hi rend="i">A 
                     Midsummer Night's Dream</hi> to <hi rend="i">The Song of Los</hi> is not immediately 
                  apparent.  Other critics have identified the figures as Har and 
                  Heva, as on Plate 5 (Bentley Plate 4).  Perhaps, given the cosmic scale of Plate 2 (Bentley Plate 8), this plate represents the microscopic world of the Blakean 
                  imagination.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="B"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>cloak</characteristic><characteristic>reclining</characteristic><characteristic>sitting</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>beard</characteristic><characteristic>arm braced</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>scepter</characteristic><characteristic>crown</characteristic><characteristic>arm at side</characteristic><characteristic>leg dangling</characteristic><characteristic>leg drawn up</characteristic><characteristic>fairy</characteristic><characteristic>king</characteristic><characteristic>Har</characteristic><characteristic>Oberon</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A male figure, wearing a gown and a separate cloak,
