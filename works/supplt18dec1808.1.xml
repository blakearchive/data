                    <p>The full sheet was folded to form two leaves. Cumberland's letter appears on
                        the first recto (object 1), first verso (object 2), and second recto (object
                        3) of the folded sheet. The second verso is not pictured. Below the end of
                        Cumberland's letter to Blake on object 3, Cumberland added instructions to
                        his son, also named George, to deliver the letter and await Blake's response
                        in person. Blake responded to Cumberland the following day in a separate
                        letter dated 19 December 1808 that is available through the Index of
                        Letters. The full sheet view of objects 2 and 3 is available as a

                        instructions to his son, also named George. The instructions read "Dear
