St. Matthew stands in front of but is shorter than his companion; the angel's head and shoulders are visible above Matthew's head.  The angel stands facing forward, but turns his head slightly left and tilts it down.  His enormous wings are folded but spread to either side of his body.  He extends his slightly bent right arm down to the left at 45 degrees, and grasps one end of a scroll with his raised right hand.  His left hand holds the other side of the scroll, and is visible just below Matthew's raised hands.  The angel seems to be nude, and has short curly hair.  Light surrounds his head and upper body, forming a halo or kind of mandorla.  The angel holds the scroll open in front of Matthew, who bends his head to read the lines of Hebrew text visible on the scroll's surface.  St. Matthew stands in a semi-crouched position facing left.  His shoulders are slightly hunched.  His left arm is by his side, drawn forward slightly and bent across his torso at the elbow.  His raised left hand is open, with the fingers spread and the vertical palm facing away.  His right hand is also raised in front of his chest, and mirrors the left in position.  These hand gestures and his open mouth suggest surprise.  His bent left leg is forward.  The shape of his garments suggests that his right leg is also bent and extended backwards.  He wears a long gown, belted at a high waistline.  His left foot emerges from beneath its folds.  He has a beard and short curly hair.  Its color suggests his age.  To either side of Matthew's lower body, but especially on the left, the angel's light reveals the bricks in a wall, or possibly an altar, behind the figures.  Dark shadow surrounds Matthew and the angel, stretching to the edges of the design on the bottom and the left and right sides.  The design is not based on any specific passage in the gospel of Matthew.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="E"><characteristic>angel</characteristic><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>head down</characteristic><characteristic>arm bent</characteristic><characteristic>arm extended</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised at 45 degrees</characteristic><characteristic>hand raised</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>short hair</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>wing</characteristic><characteristic>halo</characteristic><characteristic>mandorla</characteristic><characteristic>light</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The figures of St. Matthew and the angel fill this design.
