    The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of thirty-three of Blake’s water color illustrations to the Bible.  All take their subjects from the New Testament and have been added to the twenty Old Testament subjects published in March 2010 as “Illustrations to the Bible, c. 1780-1824,” under Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings.  This new group is presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake’s images).
                <lb/><lb/>
                   Blake executed most of these New Testament water colors c. 1800-05 for his patron Thomas Butts.  The exceptions are <hi rend="i">The Whore of Babylon</hi> of 1809 and <hi rend="i">The Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins</hi> in the Yale Center for British Art, datable to c. 1825. The subjects range from the childhood of Jesus to his ascension, the later history of his parents and one of his major followers, St. Paul, and a group of eight designs based on the Book of Revelation.  While the illustrations of the life of Christ are fairly conventional in their subjects, in part because of the long tradition of picturing almost every event in the Gospels, individual motifs recall designs in Blake’s illuminated books and thus offer a window on Blake’s visual interpretation of the Bible. The illustrations of Revelation complement Blake’s intense engagement with apocalyptic events and images in his own poetry.
                    <lb/><lb/>
                        The selection of fifty-three biblical water colors now available in the Archive will be supplemented in the future with early works, such as <hi rend="i">Abraham and Isaac</hi>, datable to c. 1780, and will continue through Blake’s final biblical water colors, such as <hi rend="i">Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</hi>. 
                    <lb/><lb/>

Dominating the top center of the design is the figure of Jesus, hovering in mid-air. Jesus wears a gown and has long, curly hair and a beard. He faces forward and slightly right, looking down at Saul. His legs are extended back and his right arm is raised horizontally, pointing. His left arm is at his side and he appears to be reaching for Saul, or pointing toward him, with his left hand. Jesus emanates beams of light from the aura that surrounds him. To the left of Jesus are four winged and gowned angels, hovering and facing away. The bottom angel may be male and faces left and down. He has long hair and his body is almost horizontal. The second-to-bottom angel has long hair. Its gender is indeterminable. The second-to-top angel may be male and has short, curly hair. He faces right and up. The top angel is only visible as a pair of wings. Three gowned and winged angels, facing forward, are visible hovering to the right of Jesus. The bottom angel may be male. He has long, curly hair and faces right, looking down slightly. His body is almost horizontal. The middle angel may be male and looks left and up. Only the wings of the topmost angel are visible. Dominating the bottom center of the design is the figure of Saul. His body is twisted so that the lower half faces left and slightly forward, and the upper half faces forward. He looks up at Jesus, mouth open. He has short, curly hair and a beard. Saul wears a shirt and pants with a cloak and sandals. His left leg is bent as he sits on a horse. His arms are raised horizontally with his palms held vertically, fingers of his left hand slightly spread. Saul sit on a horse, which faces left and down. It kneels with its legs bent under it and its head down. The horse wears a saddle and reins. To the left of Saul are the heads and upper bodies of several figures, probably soldiers, but only four are clearly represented. They may all wear helmets. The leftmost figure faces left and down with hands to his face. The next figure to the right has long hair and faces up and slightly right with his mouth partly open. The figure second from right faces up and right and has a beard. The rightmost figure faces left and down, hands to his face. Above the heads to the left of Saul, four spears are visible. To the right of Saul are the heads and upper bodies of three figures, probably wearing helmets. The leftmost figure faces down and to the right, hands to face. We see only the heads of the two figures on the right. The road to Damascus that Saul rides on is portrayed as a strip of bare earth. The sky is dark.
