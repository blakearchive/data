                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>The general theme and subject of this composition were probably influenced by several biblical passages, including Ruth 2:1-17, I Samuel 12:16-19, and Matthew 9:38.  This monochrome wash depicts a gathering of seven people of
                        different ages, male and female, in the foreground. There are other figures
                        in less detailed sketch near the upper left of the wash. The group furthest
                        back consists of eight or nine figures, two of whom raise their arms to the
                        sky. They stand in front of a building, possibly a barn. In front of the
                        group of figures, two figures with more discernible features walk together.
                        At least one figure is male. They appear to be disgruntled and may be
                        arguing. The figures may be standing in a field. Positioned prominently in
                        the center of the wash, a man, probably Christ, with a beard and curly hair stands and looks
                        down toward the group of figures to his left. He extends his arms across his
                        body, to the right, and his palms face up. He may gesture toward the girl to
                        his right. The girl has her long hair in what appears to be a loose plait.
                        She bends her left leg to kneel on the ground. Her right leg is not visible
                        and likely extends in front of her. She appears to have a bushel of wheat in
                        her lap. An older bearded male stands to the right of the central figure. He
                        extends and raises his arms toward the sky, holding his hands closely
                        together. To the left of the central figure, three adults and one child
                        kneel on the ground. Of this group, the two figures on the left are male.
                        One male figure has long white hair and a beard. His eyes are closed. To his
                        right there is a male figure with curly hair, but his face is not visible.
                        To his right a female figure with her right arm extended in front of her and
                        her head bowed in supplication. Her hair is long and curled. A child with
                        curly hair and of indiscernible gender kneels in front of her with its head
                        resting in her lap. The sky appears to be dark with storm clouds. Lightning
                        or parts of the clouds extend toward and touch the field in the background.
                        If looked at closely, there also appears to be the barely-discernible sketch
                        of a figure wrapped within the clouds.</illusobjdesc>
