                  gambol across the design from mid-upper right to lower left, in a woodland setting.
                  Comus, the nude male in human form at center-right, prances forward with left leg
                  extended, brandishing a magician's wand or staff in one of his upraised hands.  
                  Three of his followers are depicted, with another hand and arm, presumably of a fourth 
                  enchanted follower, extending just to the left of the tree trunk on the right.
                  The three fully pictured followers have each been turned into brutes and have animal heads atop
                  (mostly) human bodies (from left to right, a hog, a wolf, and a lynx).  
                  They each bear a torch or large candle, and the woman-hog on the left also lifts a goblet in her left hand.
                  A young woman sits half-reclining on a rock or bank at the bottom right corner;
                  her hands are clasped before her and her eyes appear to gaze upward and to the left.  
                  She is Milton's "Lady," threatened by Comus.  In the upper left corner hovers an angelic figure, with wings
                  half-folded and hands raised in front of his chest, palms held facing together.
                  This figure, the "attendant Spirit," appears to be looking downward at the revelers and Lady.
                  A tree with prominent roots grows above the Lady and arches rightward out of the design, while other
                  trees fill in the background to the left and right of the human-beasts.  The dark sky with stars indicates
                  that this is a night scene.

                     to look right, holding both arms above his head.  His left arm is bent at the elbow, first
                     finger pointing upward; he holds a magician's wand or staff in his upraised right hand.  His hair is curly and he appears to be smiling, eyes raised.

                     of his followers are depicted at full or nearly-full length, with another hand and arm, 
                     presumably of a fourth enchanted follower, extending just to the left of the tree trunk on the right.
                     The three fully pictured followers have each been turned into brutes and have animal heads atop
                     (mostly) human bodies (from left to right, a hog, a wolf, and a lynx).  The leftmost figure, a
                     woman wearing a transparent gown, has the head of a hog and a spiky or bristly vest-like covering
                     on her upper body.  This may represent a hog's bristles.  This figure strides forward towards the viewer with her left foot on tiptoe and twists her 
                     upper body rightward, lifting both arms over her head; she carries a candle in her right hand
                     and a goblet in her left.  A blunt tooth or teeth are visible in her lower jaw.  The wolf-man to the right of 
                     her lunges left, with right leg bent forward and left leg
                     extended behind him.  He twists away and to the right, as if to look behind him, and lifts both arms
                     vertically; his left palm is held vertically, and his right hand holds a candle.  The fur from his 
                     wolf's head extends across his shoulders and down his back, visible as he twists away from the viewer. 
                     He is otherwise nude.  A long tongue and several sharp teeth are visible in his open mouth.  The third fully (or almost fully) pictured 
                     follower is just to the right of Comus.  Facing the viewer, this figure holds both arms upward at roughly 135 degrees, left hand 
                     holding a candle and right held with palm vertical.  His lynx's head is bent slightly to the right.
                     Hair or fur extends from the head into a ruff around the neck, and
                     from there down the center of the chest, fanning out
                     as if circling the torso.  Sexually ambiguous, this figure seems to be wearing a sort of gown or skirt 
                     from the waist down, and steps forward and to the left with a visible right foot (possibly wearing a sandal or shoe of some sort) resting on the tree trunk.

                     Her arms are bent at the elbows, her hands are clasped before her as if in prayer and her eyes appear 
                     to gaze upward and to the left.  She wears a long, high-waisted gown and has long curly hair.

                     towers above the Lady from his position standing before the table at the right of the design.  With body facing
                     the viewer and legs spread, as if dominating enough space as possible, Comus holds a goblet in his 
                     left hand and extends his right vertically towards the Lady to hold his magician's wand or staff over her head.  Comus turns his head to the viewer's left to look toward the Lady, keeping her enchanted.  
                     He wears a long, rose-purple cloak cape and semi-transparent tights that end above the knee; his short, curly hair is 
                     colored blue.  The goblet contains a liquid, perhaps a magic potion.

                  Though her legs lie facing right, she turns her upper body to face forward and holds her arms out from her body,
                  palms facing downward, perhaps as if just freed from her enchantment to Comus.  Her head up, she looks slightly leftward.

                  a bank at the level of the figures' heads, and to send roots downward to the level of the water and the figures' feet.
                  The Lady appears to be seated in a chair-like structure created by a section of these roots.  
                  The trees' foliage is just visible at the top of the design.
                  Rays of light shoot over the hilly horizon, shown in the distance in the gaps between the

                     earring dangles from her left ear.  Her left foot is visible beneath the hem of her semi-transparent gown.  The child-nymph
                     on the left is half-hidden behind Sabrina.  Facing forward and looking left, she holds a turbinate shell,
                    perhaps a whelk, with one hand over the other.  The other two nymphs are of adult height and
                    hover to the right of Sabrina.  The nymph farthest right carries a a covered cup or vase before her. This 
                    nymph has jewels or loops encirciling her visible upper left arm that are similar to those in Sabrina's bracelets; 
                    she is also wearing a circular or hoop earring in her left earlobe. The second
                    adult nymph holds a conch shell in her hands, and may have the suggestion of an earring below her left ear.
                     All five in this group, including Sabrina, seem to hover just above the surface of water at the bottom right corner of the 
                     design, which perhaps represents the Severn.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="object" location="BD"><characteristic>shell</characteristic><characteristic>vase</characteristic><characteristic>goblet</characteristic><characteristic>beads</characteristic><characteristic>earring</characteristic><characteristic>pearl</characteristic><characteristic>jewelry</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Sabrina, goddess of the River Severn, appears in this design to free the Lady from her

                     The Lady appears to be seated in a chair-like structure created by a section of these roots.

                  walks rightward towards her old home; the hooded, aged mother already clasps the Lady with one hand
                  around her waist, and her father grasps the Lady's wrist.   The Lady's brothers have also returned, and are positioned 
                  just to the left of the Lady.  They

                  the Spirit twists gracefully to gaze at the human tableau below.  The rising sun breaks
                  over hills on the horizon in the background.  A clump of bushes or small trees appears in the middle distance just inside the left border of the design.

                     As in previous designs, the brothers' positions are closely parallel; here, facing forward with one positioned in front 
                     and slightly to the right
                     of the other, they each step forward or stand with their weight on their left legs, right legs slightly bent and right feet on tiptoe.
                     Both turn their torsos gently leftward and twist their necks at nearly the same angle to look up and left, eyes raised, at the attendant Spirit.  Both gesture with surprise at the new (to them) appearance of the Spirit  The brother on the right raises his hands, palms verical; the brother on the left raises his right hand with palm out.
