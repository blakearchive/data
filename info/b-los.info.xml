      loss of Edenic pleasures through Urizenic error and the world it

      creates. The narrative then centers on Los's anguished responses to

      that world, including his transformation of the void into matter

      and his binding of Urizen.</p><p>The five plates of <cite>The Book of Los</cite> were etched in

      intaglio and printed in 1795. There is only one complete copy (A),

      plus a separate impression of Plate 4. The designs on Plates 1-3

      and 5 were color printed from the surfaces of copperplates bearing

      only etched outlines of the pictorial motifs.</p></div></remarks><related><relHeader>All Known Copies</relHeader><relationship><link type="copy" ptr="b-los.a">Copy A, 1795</link><br/>
