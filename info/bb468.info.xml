                William Hayley’s three-volume biography of his friend and fellow poet, William Cowper, was an immediate success when published and did much to established Cowper’s reputation as a man of letters. The first two volumes were published in 1803 and the third the following year. The work contains six plates, all signed by Blake as the engraver. Blake also signed one plate, known as “The Weather House” (Object 4) as the designer, although the roundel in the lower portion of the design picturing three hares was probably based on a design by George Romney. Blake’s work on these engravings was scrutinized by members of Hayley’s circle, notably Cowper’s cousin, Lady Harriet Hesketh, and their criticisms may have led to some of the friction that appears in Blake’s relationship with Hayley from 1801 onward. 
            </p><p>The plates for Hayley’s biography of Cowper constitute one of the first commissions Blake worked on during his three-year sojourn on the West Sussex coast. In a letter to Thomas Butts of 11 September 1801, Blake states that his “Principal labour at this time is Engraving Plates for Cowpers Life” (Erdman page 716). Writing to his brother James two years later, on 30 January 1803, Blake states that his wife Catherine “has undertaken to Print the whole number of the Plates for [the first two volumes of] Cowpers work” (Erdman page 726). </p><p>Blake made two drawings of Cowper after Romney’s portrait of the poet.  These were the basis for two miniature paintings of Cowper and the portrait engraving that is the frontispiece for Hayley’s biography (Object 1). There are also four drawings of the designs for Cowper’s funeral monument that Blake produced at Hayley’s request in 1802.  The first two drawings are Hayley’s first idea for the monument and were sent to John Flaxman who was commissioned to sculpt the monument. The third drawing revises Hayley’s first idea and was the basis from Flaxman’s finished monument as well as Blake’s engraving, which was published in the third volume of Hayley’s biography (Object 6). Blake made two drawings of this second idea, presumably one for Flaxman to sculpt and the other for Blake to engrave. </p></div></remarks><related><relationship>
