Both their sublime imagery and the printmaking technique Blake used to create them evolved out of his illuminated books of 1790-95. Although at least one of the prints, *God Judging Adam*, shows evidence of having been printed from a copperplate etched in relief, the other eleven appear to have been painted within pen and ink outlines on gessoed millboards (a thick cardboard) and printed onto large sheets of damp wove paper using a rolling press. From such a prepared matrix Blake was often able to print two impressions (a first and second pull) without repainting the matrix, and he finished all impressions in water colors and pen and ink. No more than three impressions of any one of the twelve designs are extant. After printing, each impression was worked up with pen and ink outlining and water colors. For a full technical description of Blake’s large color prints and their relation to the illuminated books and *Book of Designs*, see Joseph Viscomi, <a href="http://siteslab.unc.edu//viscomi/Annus_Mirabilis/index.html">Blake's 'Annus Mirabilis': the Productions of 1795,"</a>*Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly* (fall, 2007): 52-83.</p><p>An impression of *Elohim Creating Adam* (Butlin 290) and an impression of *Nebuchadnezzar* (Butlin 304) may be untraced. There are twenty-nine extant impressions of twelve designs, all produced in at least two printings, c. 1795 and c. 1804-05. It is possible that, c. 1805, Blake added more hand outlining and tinting to some impressions printed in 1795. No design has more than three extant impressions. As with the illuminated books, each impression is different due to variations in color printing and finishing.

              Modern scholars have interpreted the connections among the designs and their iconography, but no interpretation has become definitive. It seems as though the twelve subjects are not a series with a fixed sequence, but rather a group of designs centered upon images of the fallen world. Within that group are a few companion prints, such as *Elohim Creating Adam* and *Satan Exulting over Eve*, associated in subject, design, or both. The textual sources for the images range from the Bible to Shakespeare, Milton, and Blake's own poetic mythologies of the mid-1790s.</p><p>The large color prints are widely dispersed. The Archive contains all extant impressions of the twelve designs except the last impression of *Hecate, or the Night of Enitharmon’s Joy*, in the National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh, which declined the Archive’s request for a high-resolution image. Eleven prints are drawn from the Tate Collection, by far the largest single collection; the others are from the British Museum; the Collection of Robert N. Essick; the Fitzwilliam Museum; the J. Paul Getty Museum; the Philadelphia Museum of Art; the Minneapolis Institute of Arts; the Henry E. Huntington Library and Art Gallery; the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; the National Gallery of Art, Washington; a private collection; the Victoria and Albert Museum; and the Yale Center for British Art.</p></div></remarks><related><relationship>*Blake's Notebook*, pages 44 and 48.<br/>
