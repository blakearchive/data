<info id="esxiii"><worktitle><div id="esxiii.title"><h1>*Deaths Door*</h1></div></worktitle><remarks><div id="esxiii.top"><p>In October 1805, Blake was commissioned by the engraver and
         would-be publisher Robert H. Cromek to prepare forty drawings
         illustrating Robert Blair's <link ptr="bb435" type="work">*The Grave*</link>, a popular "Graveyard" school poem first
         published in 1743. Cromek planned to select twenty of these designs
         for a de luxe edition of the poem. In Cromek's first prospectus of
         November 1805, Blake is named as both the designer and engraver of
         fifteen designs. The prospectus further states that "the original
         Drawings, and a Specimen of the Stile of Engraving, may be seen at
         the Proprietor's, Mr. Cromek." The "Specimen" is probably this
         white-line etching of *Deaths Door*. Its rugged and primitive
         boldness, coupled with public reaction to such a "Style of
         Engraving," apparently convinced Cromek to find another craftsman
         to engrave Blake's designs. In a second prospectus, also of
         November 1805, Cromek announced that Luigi (or Louis) Schiavonetti
         would engrave twelve designs for the new edition. Blake had lost
         both the chance to introduce one of his highly individual graphic
         techniques into a commercial project and the potentially lucrative
         commission to engrave his own designs. His relationship with Cromek
         soon descended into anger and argument. The volume with
         Schiavonetti's engravings was not published until 1808.</p><p>This is the only known impression of the white-line *Deaths
         Door*; it may be the one Cromek displayed to the public.</p></div></remarks><related>
