<info id="nnr"><worktitle><div id="NNR.title"><h1>*There is No Natural Religion*</h1></div></worktitle><remarks><div id="NNR.top"><p>Blake divided this series of aphoristic declarations and

      accompanying emblem-like designs into two groups of numbered

      propositions, designated by modern editors as "series a" and

      "series b." In the first, Blake states basic principles, derived

      from the philosophy of John Locke and his followers, about physical

      perception, reason, and the limits of knowledge. The second series

      redefines and confutes the first and argues for the infinitude of

      spiritual perceptions. Shared graphic styles, themes, and genre

      closely associate <cite>There is No Natural Religion</cite> with

      <cite>All Religions are One</cite>.</p><p>Blake etched the work in relief on twenty small plates c. 1788.

      A few designs show touches of white-line work. Impressions of only

      nineteen plates are now extant; no impression is known from the

      plate that presumably bore proposition "III" in series b. Only two

      printings are known. The first, c. 1794, is an abridgement

      consisting of twelve plates (a1-9; b3, 4, 12). These show

      rudimentary color printing and hand tinting on some plates. This

      printing is represented by Copies A-D, G, and M, although later

      extractions and additions in some of these copies have obscured

      Blake's intentions for his abridgement, in which the Lockean

      principles of series a are directly refuted by the three plates

      from series b. The second printing (1795) contains ten plates from

      series b (b1, 3, 4, 6, 7-12) plus the title page from series a

      (a2). Only a single large-paper copy (L), printed as a companion to

      the large-paper copy (A) of <cite>All Religions are One</cite>,

      plus a few loose pulls, are known from this printing. It too shows

      rudimentary color printing. At a much later date, probably no

      earlier than 1818, Blake added pen and ink framing lines to copy

      L.</p></div></remarks><related><relHeader>All Known Copies</relHeader><relationship>
