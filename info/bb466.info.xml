These were published in 1802 as quarto numbers, each with three engravings by Blake.  As the general title page indicates, the poems all deal with “Anecdotes Relating to Animals.”  In his “Preface,” Hayley states that his plan was to issue one ballad a month, “and to complete the whole series in fifteen Numbers.”  The letterpress text was printed by the Chichester printer Joseph Seagrave; the plates were printed by Blake and his wife Catherine on their own rolling press.  Although two book dealers, P. Humphry and R. H. Evans, were selected to sell the ballads, most copies seem to have been sold by Hayley to his friends.  Sales were less than brisk and the project ceased after only four ballads were issued.  Blake designed and executed twelve plates, including a frontispiece for the general title page and a tailpiece to the “Preface,” both issued with the first ballad.  Two further plates were engraved by Blake after designs on antique gems (Plates 5 and 11).</p><p>The London bookseller Richard Phillips published an octavo edition of fifteen ballads by Hayley in 1805.  For this volume, Blake engraved new plates of his designs for three of the ballads first published in 1802 and both designed and engraved new illustrations for two of the additional ballads.</p></div></remarks><related><relationship><i>Blake's Notebook</i><br/>, Object 75.<br/>
