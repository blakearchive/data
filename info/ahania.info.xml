<info id="ahania"><worktitle><div id="AHANIA.title"><h1>*The Book of Ahania*</h1></div></worktitle><remarks><div id="AHANIA.top"><p>Etched in intaglio on six plates, <cite>The Book of

         Ahania</cite> continues with the format, themes, and imagery of

         <cite>The Book of Urizen</cite>. Ahania, who represents Urizen's

         female portion, is less central to the action than Fuzon, a son of

         Urizen who revolts against his father. The narrative is one of

         Blake's many versions of the contentions between repression and

         liberation. In this instance, the consequences are dire, as Ahania

         indicates in her concluding lament.</p><p><cite>The Book of Ahania</cite> was etched and printed in 1795.

         There is only one complete copy (A), plus separate impressions of

         Plates 1, 2, 4, and 5. The designs on Plates 1, 2, and 6 were

         printed planographically in colors from copper plates bearing only

         etched outlines of the pictorial motifs.</p></div></remarks><related><relHeader>All Known Copies</relHeader><relationship><link type="copy" ptr="ahania.a"> Copy A, 1795</link><br/>
