         and artist from his earliest years. As he told John Flaxman in a
         letter of 12 September 1800, "Milton lovd me in childhood &amp; shewd
         me his face" (Erdman page 707). Several early drawings, such as the
         <cite>Satan, Sin, and Death</cite> of c. 1780 (Butlin 101), were
         probably inspired by Milton. In 1790-92, Blake loosely sketched
         several illustrations to <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> in his
         <cite>Notebook</cite> (Butlin 201). He composed his first series of
         water colors illustrating one of Milton's poems in 1801 when the
         Rev. Joseph Thomas commissioned eight designs for
         <cite>Comus</cite> (Butlin 527). Thomas later acquired (very
         probably on commission) a set of twelve water color illustrations
         to <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> in 1807 (Butlin 529) and, in 1809,
         the six water colors illustrating "On the Morning of Christ's
         Nativity" presented here (Butlin 538). Between 1808 and 1815, Blake
         produced similar (but not in every respect identical) sets of the
         <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> and "Nativity" designs for Thomas Butts
         (Butlin 529, 542). The Butts set of the "Nativity Ode" water colors
         is now in the Huntington Library and Art Gallery.</p><p>Blake's interest in the "Nativity Ode" began some years before
         his execution of these water colors. His illuminated book,
         <cite>Europe a Prophecy</cite> (1794), clearly shows the influence
         of Milton's ode. By 1809, Blake may have taken a renewed interest
         in the poem because of his increasingly Christocentric theological
         views. His harsh criticism of classical civilization resonates with
         two of the "Nativity" designs, "The Old Dragon" and "The Overthrow
         of Apollo and the Pagan Gods" (Objects 3 and 4). Modern critics
         have been hard pressed to find Blake dissenting from Milton's own
         iconography and perspectives in the ode.</p><p>Blake's literary response to the life and works of John Milton
         finds its fullest expression in the illuminated book <cite>Milton a
            Poem</cite>.</p></div></remarks><related><relationship>*Sketch for "The Old Dragon"*<br/>
