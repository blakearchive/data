<info id="europe"><worktitle><div id="EUROPE.title"><h1>*Europe a Prophecy*</h1></div></worktitle><remarks><div id="EUROPE.top"><p>The second of Blake's "Continental Prophecies" (see also

      <cite>America</cite> and <cite>The Song of Los</cite>),

      <cite>Europe</cite> presents in mythopoeic form the fundamental

      philosophical positions in conflict in Blake's revolutionary era.

      Historical events are reconfigured into their universalized

      representations through Blake's own cast of characters, including

      Enitharmon, the female personification of fallen nature and

      history, Orc, the spirit of revolt, and Los and Urizen, the

      "Eternals" who would become central to Blake's mythic system of the

      "Zoas." These contending forces lead beyond political revolution to

      an apocalypse of biblical scope. Only Copies H and K contain pl. 3,

      a whimsical prefatory statement about the poem's origin.</p><p>Blake etched in relief, with considerable white-line work in

      some designs, and first printed the eighteen plates of

      <cite>Europe</cite> in 1794. The first printing of that year

      produced proof Copies a-c. Copy a, lacking Plates 3, 8, 12-16, and

      with Plate 17 following Plate 11, may be an early version of the

      book before the missing plates were etched. Copies b and c are not

      working proofs or copies but gatherings of early impressions (some,

      as in Copy a, in early states). These groups lack the same seven

      plates absent from Copy a and are from the same first printing.

      Some posthumous impressions were added to these groups by

      nineteenth-century owners. Copies B-G were also produced in 1794,

      perhaps shortly after the proof printing. There are only two later

      printings: 1795 (Copies A and H) and 1821 (Copy K). Copy A contains

      some opaque water colors probably added by someone other than

      Blake. Copies I, L, and M are posthumous.</p></div></remarks><related><relHeader>All Known Copies</relHeader><subHeader>This list includes untraced copies known only from sales catalogues.</subHeader><relationship>Copy a (proofs), 1794<br/>
