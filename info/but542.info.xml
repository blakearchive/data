         and artist from his earliest years. As he told John Flaxman in a
         letter of 12 September 1800, "Milton lovd me in childhood &amp; shewd
         me his face" (Erdman page 707). Several early drawings, such as the
         <cite>Satan, Sin, and Death</cite> of c. 1780 (Butlin 101), were
         probably inspired by Milton. In 1790-92, Blake loosely sketched
         several illustrations to <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> in his
         <cite>Notebook</cite> (Butlin 201; see Related Works, below). He composed his first series of
         water colors illustrating one of Milton's poems in 1801 when the
         Rev. Joseph Thomas commissioned eight designs for
         <cite>Comus</cite> (Butlin 527). In 1809, Blake produced for Thomas a 
         set of six illustrations to Milton's "On the Morning of Christ's Nativity" (Butlin 538).
         Blake repeated the same basic "Nativity Ode" designs, with many minor but intriguing variations,
         for his main patron, Thomas Butts, in about 1815 (Butlin 542).  This later series is presented here.
         The date is based on stylistic considerations--see the Note following Composition Date on the Work Information
         page.  When sold at auction in 1852, the water colors were accompanied by the poem, or possibly
         only the passages illustrated, in manuscript.  This now-lost text may have been written by Blake, 
         like the transcriptions in his hand of the passages illustrated still with his "L'Allegro" and
         "Il Penseroso" illustrations (Butlin 543).</p><p>Blake's interest in the "Nativity Ode" began long before
         his execution of the Thomas set of water colors. His illuminated book,
         <cite>Europe a Prophecy</cite> (1794), clearly shows the influence
         of Milton's ode. By 1809, Blake may have taken a renewed interest
         in the poem because of his increasingly Christocentric theological
         views. His harsh criticism of classical civilization resonates with
         two of the "Nativity" designs, "The Old Dragon" and "The Overthrow
         of Apollo and the Pagan Gods" (objects 3 and 4). Modern critics
         have been hard pressed to find Blake dissenting from Milton's own
         iconography and perspectives in the ode.</p><p>Blake's literary response to the life and works of John Milton
         finds its fullest expression in the illuminated book <cite>Milton a
            Poem</cite>.</p></div></remarks><related><relationship><link type="work" ptr="but538"><i>Six Illustrations to Milton's "On the Morning of Christ's Nativity": The Thomas Set</i></link><br/>
