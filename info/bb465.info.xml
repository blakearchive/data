Relating to Animals*</h1></div></worktitle><remarks><div id="bb465.top"><p>While Blake was resident in Felpham on the Sussex coast, his new patron William Hayley began to write a series of ballads to be illustrated by the artist-engraver.  These were published in 1802 as quarto numbers, each with three engravings by Blake.  As the general title page indicates, the poems all deal with “Anecdotes Relating to Animals.”  Sales were less than brisk and the project ceased after only four ballads were issued.  In January 1805, Hayley contacted the London bookseller Richard Phillips about publishing a new, octavo edition of the ballads.  Blake began to execute engravings for this edition no later than March and completed five plates by June.  For this 1805 volume, Hayley added twelve ballads to the four first published in 1802.  Blake engraved new plates of his designs for three of the 1802 ballads (Plates 1-3) and both designed and engraved new illustrations for two of the additional ballads (Plates 4-5).  Blake and Phillips were to “go equal shares … in the expense and the profits” (Blake’s letter to Hayley of 22 January 1805, Erdman page 763).  Robert Southey’s mocking review of Hayley’s poems and Blake’s illustration to “The Dog” (Plate 1) appeared in the *Annual Review* for 1805.</p></div></remarks><related><relationship>*Blake's Notebook*, Object 75.<br/>
