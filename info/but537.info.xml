      </i></h1></div></worktitle><remarks><div id="but537.top"><p>
         The poetry of John Milton was important to Blake as both poet
         and artist from his earliest years. As he told John Flaxman in a
         letter of 12 September 1800, "Milton lovd me in childhood &amp; shewd
         me his face" (Erdman page 707). Several early drawings, such as the
         <cite>Satan, Sin, and Death</cite> of c. 1780 (Butlin 101), were
         probably inspired by Milton. In 1790-92, Blake loosely sketched
         several illustrations to <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> in his
         <cite>Notebook</cite> (Butlin 201). He composed his first series of
         water colors illustrating one of Milton's poems in 1801 when the
         Rev. Joseph Thomas commissioned eight designs for
         <cite>Comus</cite> (Butlin 527).  Blake produced a set of twelve
         <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> designs in 1807 for the same patron (Butlin 529,
         sometimes called the "small" set).  In the next year, Blake executed another
         series of twelve <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> designs, with a larger format, for
         Thomas Butts (Butlin 536, sometimes called the "large" set).
      </p><p>
         We know from John Linnell's journal that Blake "began copies from his Drawings
         from Miltons P.L." on 9 May 1822 (Butlin page 388).  This is almost certainly a
         reference to the three water colors illustrating <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> presented
         here (Butlin 537).  They were probably commissioned by Linnell and remained in his
         family's possession until their dispersal at auction in 1918.  It may have been Blake's 
         intention to produce another set of twelve water colors, much as he had produced for
         Linnell a complete set of water colors illustrating the Book of Job in 1821, but only
         the three extant designs are known.  They are based on the fourth, eighth, and eleventh
         illustrations in the Butts series.  In comparison to these models, the Linnell water
         colors show an increased emphasis on dramatic lighting, particularly evident in the
         radiance surrounding Christ in "Michael Foretells the Crucifixion" (object 3).
      </p><p>Blake's literary response to the life and works of John Milton
         finds its fullest expression in the illuminated book <cite>Milton a
            Poem</cite>.</p></div></remarks><related>
