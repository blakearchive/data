         many decades. His first efforts were a small group of wash drawings
         of the mid-1780s showing Job in his misery with his wife and three
         friends (Butlin 162-164). Another version of this subject appears
         among Blake's emblem series he sketched in his Notebook (Butlin
         201.20), but the composition appearing in the wash drawings
         culminated in the large intaglio etching/engraving, "Job" (Essick
         V) which Blake listed in his advertisement *To the Public* of
         10 October 1793. This print may have stimulated Blake's chief
         patron, Thomas Butts, to commission a tempera painting, <cite>Job
            and His Daughters</cite> (Butlin 394) c. 1799-1800 and, about six
         years later, a series of nineteen water colors illustrating the
         story of Job (Butlin 550, the so-called "Butts Set"). In 1821,
         Blake and his new patron John Linnell borrowed the water colors
         from Butts. Linnell traced the series and Blake colored them
         (Butlin 551, the so-called "Linnell Set"). Blake also added two
         more compositions to this later group and added versions of these
         same compositions to the earlier group, so that both sets now have
         twenty-one designs. The Linnell set led directly to his
         commissioning engravings. These began as a series of reduced
         sketches executed in 1823 (Butlin 557); the engravings themselves,
         with a title page added, were not finished and published until
         1826.</p><p>The Butts set of twenty-one water colors is presented here. Its
         dating is based on stylistic features, the history of commissions
         from Butts, and the presence, on two of the designs (5, 11), of
         Blake's near-monogram "WB inv," which Blake began to abandon c.
         1806.</p><p>Blake follows the general outline of the story of Job in the
         Bible, but also incorporates into his designs many motifs
         representing his personal interpretation. At the beginning, Job and
         his family attend only to the letter, rather than the spirit, of
         God's laws. Job thereby falls under a false conception of God and
         into the hands of Satan. Job's sufferings are recorded in the first
         half of the series, culminating in his horrific vision of a
         devil-god in the eleventh design. Job's spiritual education and
         material restoration are pictured in the second half of the series.
         In the penultimate design, Job tells his story to his daughters;
         the entire family is restored to life in the final design. Some
         critics and biographers have interpreted the Job series as personal
         statements about Blake's own tribulations and the spiritual peace
         he found late in life. However appealing this approach may be, it
         is made questionable by the earlier dating of the Butts series, the
         basis for all the later works.</p></div></remarks><related><relationship>
