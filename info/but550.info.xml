            <p>Blake's pictorial engagements with The Book of Job extended over many decades. His
                first efforts were a small group of wash drawings of the mid-1780s showing Job in
                his misery with his wife and three friends (Butlin 162-164). Another version of this
                subject appears among Blake's emblem series he sketched in his Notebook (Butlin
                201.20), but the composition appearing in the wash drawings culminated in the large
                intaglio etching/engraving, "Job" (Essick V) which Blake listed in his advertisement
                *To the Public* of 10 October 1793. This print may have stimulated Blake's chief
                patron, Thomas Butts, to commission a tempera painting, <cite>Job and His
                    Daughters</cite> (Butlin 394) c. 1799-1800 and, about six years later, a series
                of nineteen water colors illustrating the story of Job (Butlin 550, the so-called
                "Butts Set"). In 1821, Blake and his new patron John Linnell borrowed the water
                colors from Butts. Linnell traced the series and Blake colored them (Butlin 551, the
                so-called "Linnell Set"). Blake also added two more compositions to this later group
                and added versions of these same compositions to the earlier group, so that both
                sets now have twenty-one designs. The Linnell set led directly to his commissioning
                engravings. These began as a series of reduced sketches executed in 1823 (Butlin
                557); the engravings themselves, with a title page added, were not finished and
                published until 1826.</p>
            <p>The Butts set of twenty-one water colors is presented here. Its dating is based on
                stylistic features, the history of commissions from Butts, and the presence, on two
                of the designs (5, 11), of Blake's near-monogram "WB inv," which Blake began to
                abandon c. 1806.</p>
            <p>Blake follows the general outline of the story of Job in the Bible, but also
                incorporates into his designs many motifs representing his personal interpretation.
                At the beginning, Job and his family attend only to the letter, rather than the
                spirit, of God's laws. Job thereby falls under a false conception of God and into
                the hands of Satan. Job's sufferings are recorded in the first half of the series,
                culminating in his horrific vision of a devil-god in the eleventh design. Job's
                spiritual education and material restoration are pictured in the second half of the
                series. In the penultimate design, Job tells his story to his daughters; the entire
                family is restored to life in the final design. Some critics and biographers have
                interpreted the Job series as personal statements about Blake's own tribulations and
                the spiritual peace he found late in life. However appealing this approach may be,
                it is made questionable by the earlier dating of the Butts series, the basis for all
                the later works.</p>
