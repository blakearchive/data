<info id="songsie"><worktitle><div id="SONGSIE.title"><h1>*Songs of Innocence and of Experience*</h1></div></worktitle><remarks><div id="SONGSIE.top"><p>A complete copy of <cite>Songs of Innocence and of

      Experience</cite> contains fifty-four plates etched in relief with

      touches of white-line work in a few designs. Plate a (a tailpiece

      probably etched in the late 1780s) appears only in Copies B-D of

      the combined <cite>Songs</cite>; plate b ("A Divine Image") appears

      only in Copy BB of the combined <cite>Songs</cite> among those

      printed by Blake. Plates 34-36, 53, and 54 were first published in

      <cite>Innocence</cite> but moved to <cite>Experience</cite> in

      1794, 1795, and 1818 respectively.</p><p>The printing history of the combined <cite>Songs</cite> is

      complicated because Blake printed it while also continuing to print

      <cite>Songs of Innocence</cite> and <cite>Songs of

       Experience</cite> separately, and because some copies of the

      combined <cite>Songs</cite> were assembled by collectors or dealers

      from copies of <cite>Innocence</cite> and <cite>Experience</cite>

      separately issued, while other copies now consist of only one

      section. The separately issued copies of <cite>Innocence</cite> are

      listed under <cite>Songs of Innocence</cite>, while the few

      separate and separately issued copies of <cite>Experience</cite>

      are listed below. <cite>Experience</cite> was first printed while

      it was still a work in progress; seventeen of the plates were color

      printed in c. 1794 and now make up <cite>Songs</cite> Copies F, G,

      H, and T1-2. The first copies of the combined <cite>Songs</cite>

      were B, C, and D, formed in 1794 from copies of

      <cite>Innocence</cite> printed in 1789 and copies of the complete

      <cite>Experience</cite> printed in 1794. Combined

      <cite>Songs</cite> Copy E also consists mostly of impressions from

      these print runs, but appears to have been assembled or at least

      recolored c. 1806 for Blake's patron Thomas Butts.</p><p>The first copies of the combined <cite>Songs</cite> in which the

      two sections were printed together were A and R in 1795. That same

      year, Blake printed eight sets of <cite>Innocence</cite> and nine

      sets of <cite>Experience</cite> impressions to form

      <cite>Innocence</cite> Copy N, the "Innocence" section of combined

      <cite>Songs</cite> Copy J, the "Experience" sections of combined

      <cite>Songs</cite> Copies J, O, and S, and both sections of

      combined <cite>Songs</cite> Copies I, L, M, and BB. "Innocence" of

      combined <cite>Songs</cite> Copy O was once joined with

      "Experience" of combined <cite>Songs</cite> Copy K, and untraced

      <cite>Innocence</cite> Copy W was probably once combined with

      "Experience" of combined <cite>Songs</cite> Copy N. In c. 1802,

      Blake printed three copies of <cite>Innocence</cite> (O, R and Y

      printed as a single copy and later divided into two incomplete

      copies, and the "Innocence" section of combined <cite>Songs</cite>

      Copy P), along with two copies of <cite>Experience</cite> (the

      "Experience" sections of combined <cite>Songs</cite> Copies P and

      Q). In c. 1804, he printed another three copies of

      <cite>Innocence</cite> (P, Q, and the "Innocence" section of

      combined <cite>Songs</cite> Copy Q); in c. 1811 he printed two more

      copies (<cite>Innocence</cite> Copy S and the "Innocence" section

      of combined <cite>Songs</cite> Copy S).</p><p>Between 1818 and 1827, <cite>Innocence</cite> and

      <cite>Experience</cite> were always printed as part of the combined

      <cite>Songs</cite>. In c. 1818, Blake printed combined

      <cite>Songs</cite> Copies T2 and U; in c. 1821, Copy V; in 1825,

      Copies W and Y; in 1826, Copies Z and AA; and in 1827, Copy X. In

      all but Copy V, the plate order is the same, though Copy T2 has had

      Plate 49 repositioned and a few <cite>Innocence</cite> poems

      replaced with earlier impressions. The plate order in these last

      copies and in "Innocence" of combined <cite>Songs</cite> Copy S (c.

      1811) follows, with minor variations, the plate order of combined

      <cite>Songs</cite> Copy R, which was Blake's personal copy until he

      sold it to John Linnell in 1819. The coloring of combined

      <cite>Songs</cite> Copies K and M is posthumous.</p></div></remarks><related><relHeader>All Known Copies</relHeader><relationship><link type="copy" ptr="songsie.b">Copy B, 1789, 1794</link><br/>
