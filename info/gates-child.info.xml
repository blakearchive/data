<info id="gates-child"><worktitle><div id="GATES-CHILD.title"><h1>*For Children: The Gates of Paradise*</h1></div></worktitle><remarks><div id="GATES-CHILD.top"><p>Through a numbered series of emblems with inscriptions ranging

      from single words to brief aphorisms, Blake puts the course of

      human life from birth to death in psychological perspective. Some

      of the plates form narrative sequences; others exemplify mental

      states and their reification in the external world.</p><p>Blake etched in intaglio the eighteen plates of <cite>For

      Children</cite> in 1793 and printed all extant copies (A-E) in the

      same year. The imprint on Plate 2, the title plate, reads

      "Published by W Blake No 13 Hercules Buildings Lambeth and J.

      Johnson St. Pauls' Church Yard." In Copy A the title page is a

      proof that bears fragments of an erased imprint that may refer to

      J. Dodsley as the publisher or co-publisher. There is no other

      evidence that either Johnson (a bookseller for whom Blake executed

      many engravings) or Dodsley actually participated in the

      publication or selling of the book. Copy D has been supplemented

      with two plates (19, 20) etched c. 1820 as part of Blake's revision

      of <cite>For Children</cite> into <cite>For the Sexes: The Gates of

       Paradise</cite>, plus an additional impression of Plate 2 in its

      later, <cite>For the Sexes</cite>, state.</p></div></remarks><related><relHeader>All Known Copies</relHeader><relationship>
