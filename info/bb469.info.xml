Published in 1809, William Hayley’s biography of his close friend, the artist George Romney, contains 12 plates bearing the inscription ‘Published April 14th.” Blake engraved only one of these plates, “Sketch of a Shipwreck after Romney,” usually placed facing page 84. 
            </p><p>
                Blake first produced a drawing after Romney’s now lost painting, *A Shipwreck at the Cape of Good Hope*, which depicts a horseman named Woltemad rescuing survivors. According to Blake’s letter to Hayley of 22 June 1804, Flaxman had suggested that this painting should be engraved for Hayley’s *Life of Romney* (Erdman pages 752-53). Blake sent Hayley the preparatory drawing with his letter of 16 July 1804 (Erdman page 753) and, in an untraced letter from Hayley, received permission to begin the engraving. Blake spent the rest of the year working sporadically on the print and keeping Hayley regularly updated on his progress. In his letter of 7 August 1804, Blake informs his patron that he is working on the engraving and in his letter of 28 September 1804 states that he will soon send Hayley a proof (Erdman pages 754-55). He makes similar statements on 23 October and 4 December, before finally sending a proof with his letter to Hayley of 18 December 1804 (Edman pages 756-58).               
            </p><p>In addition to “Sketch of a Shipwreck after Romney,” Blake produced a portrait engraving of Romney for Hayley’s biography. Although Blake finished (or almost finished) the plate, Hayley did not include it in the published work. A recently discovered impression is available in the Archive under Separate Prints and Prints in Series, Engraved by Blake After Designs by Other Artists.</p></div></remarks><related><relationship>
