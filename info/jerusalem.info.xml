<info id="jerusalem"><worktitle><div id="JERUSALEM.title"><h1>*Jerusalem The Emanation of The Giant Albion*</h1></div></worktitle><remarks><div id="JERUSALEM.top"><p>Blake's final and longest epic in illuminated printing

      constitutes a recapitulation and summation of his multiple

      interests, ranging from his own mythology to biblical history, from

      sexuality to epistemology, and from the Druids to Newton. The cast

      of characters is vast, but Los (the artist's imagination at work in

      the material world), Jerusalem and Albion (the female and male

      portions of divided humanity who must be reunited), the nature

      goddess Vala, and Jesus play major roles. The poem is divided into

      four chapters, each addressed to a different audience: the Public,

      the Jews, the Deists, and the Christians. <cite>Jerusalem</cite>

      concludes with a vision of human consciousness in a

      post-apocalyptic universe. Portions of <cite>The Four Zoas</cite>,

      Blake's long manuscript poem, are repeated (often with little

      revision) in <cite>Jerusalem</cite>.</p><p>The one-hundred plates of <cite>Jerusalem</cite> were etched in

      relief, with many designs in white-line etching, between c. 1804

      (the date on the title page) and 1820. Sixty plates may have been

      completed by 1807; a few examples were exhibited in 1812. The

      printing of 1820 produced Copies A, C, and D. In the next year,

      Blake printed Copies B (chapter 1 only, Plates 1-25) and E. Copy F

      was printed, but left uncollated by Blake, in 1827. Copies H-J are

      posthumous. There are two arrangements of the plates in chapter 2,

      early (Copies A and C) and late (Copies D and E). Copy F was

      collated by John Linnell, using Copy C as a model. Most lifetime

      copies have hand tinting in gray or black, but only Copies B and E

      are colored.</p></div></remarks><related><relHeader>All Known Copies</relHeader><subHeader>This list includes untraced copies known only from sales catalogues.</subHeader><relationship>
