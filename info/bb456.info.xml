The thirty-seven plates of John Flaxman's illustrations to *The Works Days and Theogony of Hesiod* are one of Blake's major endeavors as a commercial etcher/engraver of designs by other artists.  Flaxman began to sketch designs based on Hesiod's poems in the early 1790s, but it was not until February 1816 that he entered into a contract with the publisher Longman &amp; Co. to "furnish a series of Drawings to illustrate Hesiod" (Bentley page 556).  Blake had already been commissioned to execute the plates, almost certainly on the recommendation of Flaxman, a friend of many years.  Inscriptions on a set of pre-publication proofs in the Bodleian Library indicate that Blake submitted impressions to Longman between November 1814 and October 1816; the project was completed by January 1817.  Blake, who received very few other engraving commissions during this period, was paid 5 guineas (£5.5s.) for each plate, a total of £194.5s. plus £13.13s. as reimbursement for purchasing the copperplates (Longman's records, Bentley page 558).  Without the Hesiod project, Blake and his wife Catherine might have descended into dire poverty.
      </p><p>
         Blake executed the Hesiod illustrations in an unusual graphic style.  Rather than continuous outlines, found in the engravings of Flaxman's other classical compositions, Blake used stippled lines—that is, lines composed of dots.  It is surprising to see Blake, who wrote in a letter of 1827 that "a Line is a Line in its Minutest Subdivision[s]" (Erdman page 783), deploying a technique that divides lines into points.  Perhaps he was responding to the character of Flaxman's preliminary drawings, now untraced, upon which the etchings/engravings were based.  If these were in soft pencil, then stippled lines would be an appropriate equivalent.  It is also possible that Flaxman or his publisher directed Blake to use this style.
      </p><p>
         The texts accompanying the Hesiod designs were executed in continuous lines by a writing engraver named "Jeffreys" in Longman's accounts (Bentley page 557).  The quotations and paraphrases from Hesiod's poems are based on the second edition (1815) of *The Remains of Hesiod*, translated by Charles Abraham Elton. 
      </p><p>
         Flaxman's classical compositions were influenced by, and often understood as recreations of, Greek and Etruscan vase paintings.  His illustrations of Homer's *Iliad* and *Odyssey* and of Dante's *Divine Comedy* were published, or at least engraved, in 1793.  They soon became famous and highly influential throughout Europe.  These were followed by designs for the tragedies of Aeschylus in 1795 and Blake's Hesiod engravings in 1817.  Blake also contributed three plates to the 1805 revised publication of the *Iliad* illustrations.  The Hesiod plates were frequently reprinted and included in *The Classical Compositions of John Flaxman* of 1870.  The publisher, Bell and Daldy, reportedly sold the copperplates as scrap metal in 1917 (Ruthven Todd, "Blake's Dante Plates," *Times Literary Supplement*, 29 August 1968, page 928).
