Among his many other endeavors, Thornton was the physician for Blake’s patron John Linnell, who probably played a key role in securing the commission.  Blake’s assignment was to illustrate Ambrose Philips’ English “imitation” of Virgil’s first eclogue.</p><p>Blake first produced four small designs as relief etchings on a single copperplate, but this was rejected by Thornton.  There may have been several reasons, including the unconventional style of etching, the semi-nudity of some of the figures, and the difficulties letterpress printers would have encountered with such an unusual matrix.  Apparently Blake was asked to prepare wood engravings, a medium in which he had never before worked, instead of relief etchings.  He executed a series of at least twenty-one pen, pencil, and wash drawings; these were probably approved by Thornton.  The wood engravings that Blake produced from them, however, were far less conventional.  Thornton was again taken aback by Blake’s bold transgression of contemporary styles and sensibilities.  Several influential artists, including Linnell and Sir Thomas Lawrence, commended Blake’s work; their opinions convinced Thornton to print them in his 1821 edition.  Three designs were engraved by a journeyman for the sake of comparison with Blake’s own productions in wood, and Thornton added a statement below Blake’s first design implying his own hesitations about Blake’s artistry.</p><p>We present here a selection of Blake’s preliminary drawings.  Twenty of these were sold at auction from the Linnell collection in 1918.  These are now widely dispersed.  The present ownership of each drawing reproduced here is recorded on the Work Information page.  Seven drawings are untraced and one drawing in the Linnell group (Butlin 769.4) was not engraved.  Blake almost certainly executed a preliminary drawing for his first wood engraving, but none has ever been recorded.</p></div></remarks><related>
