<info id="thel"><worktitle><div id="THEL.title"><h1>*The Book of Thel*</h1></div></worktitle><remarks><div id="THEL.top"><p><cite>The Book of Thel</cite> is Blake's first illuminated book

      written in lines of fourteen syllables, a measure used in most of

      his subsequent books. Thel, a virgin shepherdess burdened by her

      sense of mortality, seeks meaning for her life by talking with

      several creatures—a lily, cloud, worm, and clod of clay. These

      speaking symbols of life's transience are satisfied with their lot

      because all believe themselves to be part of natural cycles related

      through self-sacrifice to a higher purpose. On the final plate,

      Thel comes to her grave and hears her own unanswered questions

      redolent with fears of both death and sexuality. This voice, and

      Thel's flight from it, indicate either her failure to accept the

      harsh facts of life or the failure of her interlocutors' philosophy

      to satisfy the human desire for transcendental truths.</p><p>Blake etched <cite>The Book of Thel</cite> in relief, with a few

      touches of white-line work, on eight plates in 1789, the date on

      the title page, and 1790. Plate 1, "Thel's Motto," and Plate 8, the

      final plate, which may be a substitute for an earlier version of

      the poem (although there is no evidence that any such early version

      was etched), appear to have been etched later than Plates 2-7.

      Their lettering style is present in <cite>The Marriage of Heaven

       and Hell</cite> but not in <cite>Thel</cite>'s other plates. Both

      plates are missing from the first copy of <cite>Thel</cite>

      printed, proof Copy a (black ink, Plates 2-5, 7 only, with Plate 6

      and a duplicate Plate 2 in the San Francisco Public Library). This

      first printing of the finished work can be divided into five issues

      according to ink color: Copies H-L (green), B, E, M (raw sienna),

      A, D, R (orange-yellow ochre), C (raw umber), and G (blue).

      Untraced Copies P and Q may also be from this printing; but, given

      gaps in the relevant provenances, they might also be the same as

      Copies G and H. Large-paper Copy F, with rudimentary color

      printing, was produced in 1795; Copies N and O can be dated to c.

      1818. A pencil drawing in the British Museum shows alternative

      versions of Plates 6 and 7.</p></div></remarks><related><relHeader>All Known Copies</relHeader><subHeader>This list includes untraced copies known only from sales catalogues.</subHeader><relationship>Copy a (proofs), c. 1789<br/>
