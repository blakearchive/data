         the culmination of his long pictorial engagement with that biblical

         subject. His first efforts were a small group of wash drawings of

         the mid-1780s showing Job in his misery with his wife and three

         friends (Butlin 162-64). Another version of this subject appears

         among Blake's emblem series he sketched in his Notebook (Butlin

         201.20), but the composition appearing in the wash drawings became

         the basis for the large intaglio etching/engraving, "Job" (Essick

         V), which Blake listed in his advertisement <cite>To the

            Public</cite> of 10 October 1793. This print may have stimulated

         Blake's chief patron, Thomas Butts, to commission a tempera

         painting, <cite>Job and His Daughters</cite> (Butlin 394) c.

         1799-1800 and, about six years later, a series of nineteen water

         colors illustrating the story of Job (Butlin 550, the so-called

         "Butts Set"). In 1821, Blake and his new patron John Linnell

         borrowed the water colors from Butts. Linnell traced the series and

         Blake colored them (Butlin 551, the so-called "Linnell Set"). Blake

         also added two more compositions to this later group and added

         versions of these same compositions to the earlier group, so that

         both sets now have twenty-one designs.</p><p>The Linnell set led directly to his commissioning of the

         engravings, as set forth in a contract dated 25 March 1823. Blake

         first executed a series of twenty-one reduced pencil sketches of

         the central designs (Butlin 557). These he transferred to

         copperplates. Rather than using the customary "mixed method" of

         preliminary etching followed by engraving, Blake used pure line

         engraving in the Job plates. Perhaps one of his motivations was to

         evoke the art of the master engravers of the Renaissance whom Blake

         greatly admired, such as Albrecht Dürer. The Job engravings

         are generally considered to be Blake's masterpiece as an intaglio

         printmaker.</p><p>According to John Linnell, the border designs, unique to the

         engraved series, were a last-minute addition to the copperplates.

         Blake also added a title page, perhaps late in the production

         process. The title page is not numbered, but all the others are

         numbered, upper right in the copperplate, 1-21. The plate numbered

         "1" (Object 3 here) was mistakenly dated 1828 in the imprint; all

         the others were dated 1825. Linnell's account books show that the

         engravings were not published until March 1826.</p><p>Blake follows the general outline of the story of Job in the

         Bible, but also incorporates into his designs many motifs

         representing his personal interpretation. At the beginning, Job and

         his family attend only to the letter, rather than the spirit, of

         God's laws. Job thereby falls under a false conception of God and

         into the hands of Satan. Job's sufferings are recorded in the first

         half of the series, culminating in his horrific vision of a

         devil-god in the eleventh design. Job's spiritual education and

         material restoration are pictured in the second half of the series.

         In the penultimate design, Job tells his story to his daughters;

         the entire family is restored to life in the final design. Some

         critics and biographers have interpreted the Job series as personal

         statements about Blake's own tribulations and the spiritual peace

         he found late in life. However appealing this approach may be, it

         is made questionable by the early dating of the Butts series, the

         basis for all the later series.</p></div></remarks><related><relationship>
