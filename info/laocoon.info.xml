            Laocoön, Blake reinterprets the famous Greek sculpture as a

            copy of an original Hebraic work representing Jehovah and his two

            sons, Satan and Adam. Other inscriptions surrounding the central

            design set forth Blake's interrelated opinions on money, empire,

            morality, Christianity, and the arts. The central image of the

            statue may have been executed as early as c. 1815 in connection

            with Blake's work on illustrations for Abraham Rees, *The Cyclopaedia; or, Universal Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and Literature*. The inscribed texts surrounding the statue were

            almost certainly added at a much later date, c. 1826-27. Both

            impressions (A and B) of the single plate, etched and engraved in

            intaglio, were printed in 1826 or 1827.</p></div></remarks><related><relHeader>All Known Copies</relHeader><relationship>
