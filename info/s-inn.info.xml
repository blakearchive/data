<info id="s-inn"><worktitle><div id="S-INN.title"><h1>*Songs of Innocence*</h1></div></worktitle><remarks><div id="S-INN.top"><p>This lyric anthology evokes a predominantly pastoral world prior

      to the dualisms of adult consciousness. Human, natural, and divine

      states of being have yet to be separated. The child is the chief

      representative of this condition; other recurrent figures, such as

      the shepherd and lamb, point ultimately to the figure of Christ as

      the incarnation of the unity of innocence. In a few poems, the

      rhetoric, irony, and divided consciousness of experience begin to

      insinuate themselves into the landscape of innocence. In 1794,

      Blake combined <cite>Innocence</cite> with its contrary companion,

      the <cite>Songs of Experience</cite>, to create the combined

      <cite>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</cite>.</p><p>Blake etched the <cite>Songs of Innocence</cite> in relief, with

      white-line work in some designs, on thirty-one plates in 1789, the

      date on the title page. The first printing, also of 1789, produced

      sixteen (or possibly seventeen) copies: U (black ink) and possibly

      untraced Copy V; I, J, X, and "Innocence" of <cite>Songs of innocence and of Experience</cite> copy

      F (green ink); A-H, K-M, Z (yellow ochre or raw sienna ink). In

      addition, the "Innocence" section of what would later become

      <cite>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</cite> Copies B-E were

      printed in this first session. After 1794, the printing history of

      <cite>Innocence</cite> becomes complex because Blake began printing

      it with <cite>Experience</cite> to form copies of the combined

      <cite>Songs</cite> while continuing also to issue <cite>Songs of

       Innocence</cite> and <cite>Songs of Experience</cite> separately.

      Complicating matters further are the facts that some separately

      issued copies of <cite>Innocence</cite> were combined with

      <cite>Experience</cite> by collectors and dealers, and that copies

      of <cite>Innocence</cite> now separate were once part of copies of

      the combined <cite>Songs.</cite></p><p>In 1795, Blake printed both sections of <cite>Songs of Innocence

      and of Experience</cite> Copies A and R. In a separate print-run of

      the same year, he printed eight sets of <cite>Innocence</cite> and

      nine sets of <cite>Experience</cite> impressions to form

      <cite>Innocence</cite> Copy N, the "Innocence" section of combined

      <cite>Songs</cite> Copy J, the "Experience" section of combined

      <cite>Songs</cite> Copies J, O, and S, and both sections of

      combined <cite>Songs</cite> I, L, M, and BB. The "Innocence"

      section of combined <cite>Songs</cite> Copy O was once joined with

      the "Experience" section of combined <cite>Songs</cite> copy K;

      untraced <cite>Innocence</cite> Copy W was probably once joined

      with the "Experience" section of combined <cite>Songs</cite> copy

      N. In c. 1802, Blake printed three copies of <cite>Songs of

       Innocence</cite> (O, R and Y printed as a single copy and later

      divided into incomplete copies, and the "Innocence" section of

      combined <cite>Songs</cite> Copy P), along with two copies of

      <cite>Experience</cite> (the "Experience" sections of

      <cite>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</cite> Copies P and Q). In c. 1804, he printed another

      three copies of <cite>Songs of Innocence</cite> (P, Q, and the

      "Innocence" section of combined <cite>Songs</cite> Copy Q); in c.

      1811 he printed two more copies (<cite>Innocence</cite> Copy S and

      the "Innocence" section of combined <cite>Songs</cite> Copy S).

      This was the last time Blake printed <cite>Songs of

       Innocence</cite> separately. <cite>Songs of Innocence</cite> copy T

      is posthumous, with hand coloring in imitation of Copy B. No two

      copies of <cite>Songs of Innocence</cite> share the same

      arrangement of the plates.</p><p>Between 1818 and 1827, Blake always printed

      <cite>Innocence</cite> and <cite>Experience</cite> as parts of the

      combined <cite>Songs</cite>. In seven of the eight copies produced,

      the plate order remained the same (see <cite>Songs of Innocence and

       of Experience</cite>).</p></div></remarks><related><relHeader>All Known Copies</relHeader><subHeader>This list includes untraced copies known only from sales catalogues.</subHeader><relationship>Copy A, 1789<br/>
