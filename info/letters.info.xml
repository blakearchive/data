            <p>Letters may be less often treasured and transmitted from generation to generation
                than works of art. Blake’s surviving correspondence begins rather late in his career, in
                October 1791, the month before he turned 34, when he drops a short note to
                architect-editor Willey Reveley “to embrace the offer of engraving such beautiful
                things”—drawings by William Pars for the third volume of James Stuart and Nicholas
                Revett’s *Antiquities of Athens*, 1794—“&amp; will do what he can by the end of
                January [1792].” He writes his last letter, as far as we know, the month before his
                death at age 69 in August 1827—just three sentences to the friend and benefactor of
                his final decade, artist John Linnell, to thank him for sending ten pounds and to
                indicate that his “journey to Hampstead on Sunday brought on a relapse . . . .
                however I am upon the mending hand to day &amp; hope soon to look as I did for I
                have been yellow accompanied by all the old Symptoms.”</p>
            <p>About ninety of Blake’s letters survive, an unknown fraction of the total.
                Several—ten in the present group of 54—are known only from partial and full
                transcriptions in the second, expanded, edition of Alexander Gilchrist’s *Life of William Blake* (1880). Blake traveled seldom and not very
                far, and he was little known beyond a small circle of British contemporaries, most
                of them in London. His circle of correspondents was narrow and the geographical
                circuit small. Only three correspondents—friends and patrons Thomas Butts, William
                Hayley, and John Linnell—occasion most of the letters. There are none addressed to
                such erstwhile friends and associates as Thomas Stothard, Joseph Johnson, and Henry
                Fuseli. No surviving letter traveled outside of England, and most letters simply
                traveled across town. But Blake’s modest body of correspondence comprises an
                absorbing, revealing miscellany of simple business receipts, accounts, and reports
                on work in progress alongside friendly and not so friendly exchanges on matters of
                practical and intellectual substance. Occasionally they burst out into visions that
                amalgamate, in a characteristic Blakean vein, homely details, intensely energized
                prose, and inspired poetry.</p>
            <p>Whether or not we concur with Geoffrey Keynes’s estimation of Blake’s best letters as
                worthy of “an honoured place in any anthology of letters by men of genius”
                    (*Letters*, page xix), they are indispensable in preserving facts and
                contexts for his life and work that would be otherwise unknown and in showing him
                shift pragmatically from role to role in a very natural—and human—way, exposing
                facets of character and personality not always so apparent in his art. If he can be
                a self-advertising seeker of custom and patronage, he can also be a defensively
                boastful brother; a maker of excuses; an optimistic, excited participant; a
                miserable urban artisan trapped in the country, seeking comfort from London friends
                and patrons; a repatriated but terrified Londoner facing trial on charges of
                sedition stemming from a confrontation in the provinces—and now desperately
                dependent on Thomas Hayley, the Felpham patron whom he had come to resent if not
                despise.</p>
            <p>The letters feel closer to the externalities of everyday life than any other work
                from Blake’s hand, and some start out to be one very ordinary thing and end up being
                another quite extraordinary thing. Blake’s resistance to uniformity shows up in the
                range of expression of his most compelling letters—those grounded in everyday
                transactions but punctuated by bursts of artistic expression and intense thought
                colored by a volatile rainbow of anxiety, relief, stubborn resentment, pride, fury,
                disappointment, terror, frustration, hope, happiness, and even joy. Most of the
                letters have plain utilitarian purposes. Blake is not an artist-thinker in
                correspondence with an international circle; nonetheless, Blake being Blake, he
                seldom puts pen to paper without interesting consequences for readers, even when the
                primary aim is perfectly ordinary.</p>
            <p>G. E. Bentley, Jr., has created a list of letters that Blake may have written but are
                absent from the present record. See “William Blake and His Circle: A Checklist of
                Publications and Discoveries in 2011,” *Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly* 46:1
                (summer 2012). Untraced letters turn up more often than one might expect.</p>
