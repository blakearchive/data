      *</h1></div></worktitle><remarks><div id="but536.top"><p>
         The poetry of John Milton was important to Blake as both poet and artist from his earliest years.  As he told John 
         Flaxman in a letter of 12 September 1800, "Milton lovd me in childhood &amp; shewd me his face" (Erdman page 707).  Several 
         early drawings, such as the *Satan, Sin, and Death* of c. 1780 (Butlin 101), were probably inspired by Milton.  
         In 1790-92, Blake loosely sketched several illustrations to *Paradise Lost* in his Notebook (Butlin 201; see 
         Related Works, below).  He composed his first series of water colors illustrating one of Milton's poems in 1801 when 
         the Rev. Joseph Thomas commissioned the eight designs for *Comus* (Butlin 527) presented here.  This commission 
         and its date are established by John Flaxman's comment in a postscript to Blake in a letter to William Hayley of 31 
         July 1801: "The Revd. Joseph Thomas of Epsom desires you will at your leisure, make a few sketches of the same size 
         [as each other], which maybe any size you please from Milton's Comus for Five Guineas" (Butlin volume 1, page 373).  
         Thomas later acquired (very probably on commission) a set of twelve water color illustrations to *Paradise 
            Lost* in 1807 (Butlin 529) and six water colors illustrating "On the Morning of Christ's Nativity" in 1809 
         (Butlin 538).  In about 1815, Blake produced another set of *Comus* designs for his patron Thomas Butts (Butlin 
         528).  This later group pictures the same eight subjects, but with many significant differences in motifs and in the 
         positions and portrayals of characters from the poem.
      </p><p>
         Here, as usual in his work as an illustrator of other poets' works, Blake paid close attention to the text, but 
         this disciplined approach did not preclude his 
         own interpretations.  For example, Milton ends his 
         masque with joyous dance and song, but Blake ends his illustrations on a more serious note, as indicated by the 
         facial expressions of all six figures.  The selection of passages to illustrate in itself reveals Blake's emphasis 
         on unusual states of consciousness, including trances and visions.
      </p><p>
         Blake's literary response to the life and works of John Milton finds its fullest expression in the illuminated book 
         *Milton a Poem*.
