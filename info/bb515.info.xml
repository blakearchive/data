         Edward Young, *Night Thoughts*</h1></div></worktitle><remarks><div id="bb515.top"><p>

         Although there are no extant documentary records of the contract, it was probably in late 1794 or early 

         1795 that the publisher Richard Edwards commissioned Blake to illustrate a new, deluxe edition of 

         Edward Young's long meditative poem, *The Complaint, and the Consolation; or, Night Thoughts*, first 

         published in 1742-45 and generally known by the short title of *Night Thoughts*.  This was the largest 

         commercial project for which Blake was ever employed.  With what must have been enormous energy, he 

         executed 537 water colors (Butlin 330.1-537) illustrating the poem's nine sections, which Young called 

"Nights."  Edwards began the project by having the pages from the first and second editions of the poem glued into windows cut into large leaves of Whatman wove paper. These text pages were positioned slightly off-center so as to create a lower margin greater 

         than the upper and an outer margin greater than the inner, as in most letterpress books.  Blake filled 

         these large marginal spaces with his designs—a format retained in the published engravings with the 

         letterpress text of the poem printed in a central framed panel.  Blake was paid the paltry sum of twenty 

         guineas for his water colors, presumably because he expected to receive a great deal more for the engravings.  

      </p><p>Although all the water colors may not have been completed by the spring of 1796, Blake began at that time to etch 

         and engrave a selection of forty-three designs illustrating the first four Nights.  These were published 

         in 1797 as the first of four intended large quarto volumes.  The registration of the plates to the sheets of 

         paper, which were barely large enough to accommodate the engravings, was frequently poor, with the 

         result that even untrimmed copies of the book are missing small marginal areas of some of the designs 

         and/or the imprints and Blake's monogram signatures in the lower margins.  Before any further volumes 

         could be produced, Edwards closed his publishing business.  Blake's disappointment must have been 

         profound.  The failure of the *Night Thoughts* project may have been one of the reasons why Blake decided, 

         in 1800, to move from London to the village of Felpham on the Sussex coast and place himself under the 

         patronage of William Hayley.</p><p>Most of the water colors bear a cross or star to the left of the line (or first line of the passage) 

         illustrated.  This procedure was continued, somewhat irregularly, through the use of asterisks in 

         the published volume.  In some cases, the line preceded by an asterisk in the engravings is not the 

         same as in the corresponding water colors.  Many copies of the 1797 volume contain a two-page "Explanation 

         of the Engravings," possibly written by Blake's friend and fellow-artist Henry Fuseli.  The texts of these 

         commentaries are included in the Editors' Notes for each plate.</p><p>While Blake based his designs closely on the text, many of the images are based on personifications or 

         metaphors in the poem.  This approach tends to literalize what is only a figure of speech in the text, 

         thereby confounding conventional distinctions between the literal and the metaphoric.  Further, Blake 

         drew heavily on his own repertory of motifs and postures when illustrating Young, and thus there are 

         many parallels between the *Night Thoughts* designs and the pictures in Blake's illuminated books.  The 

         influence of the *Night Thoughts* project on Blake's writings is most directly evinced by his division 

         of his long manuscript poem, *Vala* or *The Four Zoas* (Bentley 209), into nine Nights.  That manuscript 

         also contains forty-seven pre-publication proofs of the *Night Thoughts* engravings, with lines of *The 

            Four Zoas* written in the text panels.  A further group of twenty-four proofs is now in the Houghton 

         Library, Harvard University.</p><p>Copy 1 presented here is uncolored; Copy 2 is one of at least twenty-seven copies with contemporary 

         or near-contemporary hand coloring.  The colorist or colorists have never been convincingly identified.  

         The same palette appears to have been used for most copies, but the placement of the colors varies 

         somewhat among copies.  Such variation is not characteristic of the commercial hand coloring of the 

         late eighteenth century in which a model is followed very closely.  Some scholars have divided the 

         colored copies into two styles, one dated to c. 1797 and the other to c. 1805.  There are, however, 

         colors common to the palettes of these two styles.  Two copies (Yale Center for British Art and 

         Houghton Library, Harvard University) bear early inscriptions attributing their coloring to Blake; 

         a copy in the Library of Congress has a pencil inscription attributing its coloring to Blake's wife 

         Catherine.  Five copies bear J C (or possibly H) monograms that would seem to relate to their coloring.
