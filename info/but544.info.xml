         Regained"*</h1></div></worktitle><remarks><div id="but544.top"><p>The poetry of John Milton was important to Blake as both poet
         and artist from his earliest years. As he told John Flaxman in a
         letter of 12 September 1800, "Milton lovd me in childhood &amp; shewd
         me his face" (Erdman page 707). Several early drawings, such as the
         <cite>Satan, Sin, and Death</cite> of c. 1780 (Butlin 101), were
         probably inspired by Milton. In 1790-92, Blake loosely sketched
         several illustrations to <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> in his
         <cite>Notebook</cite> (Butlin 201). He composed his first series of
         water colors illustrating one of Milton's poems in 1801 when the
         Rev. Joseph Thomas commissioned eight designs for
         <cite>Comus</cite> (Butlin 527). Thomas later acquired (very
         probably on commission) a set of twelve water color illustrations
         to <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> in 1807 (Butlin 529) and, in 1809,
         six water colors illustrating "On the Morning of Christ's Nativity"
         (Butlin 544). Between 1808 and 1815, Blake produced similar (but
         not in every respect identical) sets of the <cite>Paradise
            Lost</cite> and "Nativity" designs for Thomas Butts (Butlin 529,
         542). Twelve illustrations to "L'Allegro" and "Il Penseroso" for
         Butts followed c. 1816-20. The twelve designs for *Paradise
            Regained* presented here are on the same paper, watermarked
         1816, Blake used for the "L'Allegro" and "Il Penseroso" designs.
         Dated by Butlin to c. 1816-20, the <cite>Paradise Regained</cite>
         designs may have also been commissioned by Butts, but they were
         apparently either never delivered to him, or returned by him to
         Blake, since John Linnell's account books indicate that he
         purchased the designs directly from Blake in 1825. Thus it is
         possible that the <cite>Paradise Regained</cite> designs were
         produced at a later date, c. 1820-25, on commission for
         Linnell.</p><p>The <cite>Paradise Regained</cite> designs exemplify Blake's
         mature style as a water colorist and his close attention to the
         text he is illustrating. Many of the designs significantly
         juxtapose the dignified symmetry and calm repose of Blake's
         portrayals of Christ with the anxious and twisting energies of
         Satan. Through the deployment of such postures and gestures, Blake
         dramatizes the poem's conflict between divine imagination and
         satanic materialism. This struggle offers a pictorial analogue to
         the contests between the Zoas and their Spectres or Selfhoods in
         Blake's epic poems.</p><p>Blake's literary response to the life and works of John Milton
         finds its fullest expression in the illuminated book <cite>Milton a
            Poem</cite>.</p></div></remarks><related><relationship><link type="object" ptr="but476.1.wc.01">*The Third Temptation*</link><br/>
