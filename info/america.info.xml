         <cite>Europe</cite> and <cite>The Song of Los</cite>), Blake

         explores the radical paradigms of political repression and revolt

         through a highly imaginative treatment of the American Revolution.

         While historical figures such as Washington and Paine appear, much

         of the symbolic and thematic weight is placed on Blake's own

         invented mythological figures, including "Albions Angel" and

         "Londons Guardian" (forces of the British government), Urizen (the

         god of restrictive reason and the origin of political repression),

         and fiery Orc (the spirit of revolt). The American Revolution is

         viewed as a harbinger of universal revolution, epistemological as

         much as political.</p><p>In 1793, Blake etched in relief, with considerable white-line

         work in some designs, and first printed twenty-three plates for

         <cite>America</cite>. These include eighteen major text and design

         plates used in all complete copies, a small plate (e) bearing the

         word "Preludium" and printed above the design on Plate 3, and four

         plates (a-d) never published, perhaps because of potentially

         actionable references to "the King" and "George." The first

         printing consisted of proof Copy a (Plates 1, 4, 11, 12, 15, a-c in

         black, dark green, and dark blue inks), Copies E-G, I, K, L in

         greenish black or dark olive inks, and Copies C, D, H, R in bluish

         black and blue green inks (there is no copy designated as "J").

         There are three later printings: 1795 (Copies A, B), c. 1807 (copy

         M), and 1821 (Copy O). Copies N, P, and Q are posthumous.</p></div></remarks><related><relHeader>All Known Copies</relHeader><subHeader>This list includes untraced copies known only from sales catalogues.</subHeader><relationship>
