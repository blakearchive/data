Water Color Drawings,wc,1775-c. 1790,1775,1780swc.jpg,,1780swc,"<p>Blake's activities as a water colorist from the mid-1770s through the next decade reveal his increasing skills in that medium, ranging from apprentice work to original compositions exhibited at the Royal Academy. Assignments from his engraving instructor, James Basire, included the precise copying of tomb monuments in Westminster Abbey (Objects 1-5). These water colors were later engraved, probably with Blake's assistance, as illustrations for Joseph Ayloffe's <i>Account of Some Ancient Monuments in Westminster Abbey</i> (1780), republished in volume 2 of the Society of Antiquaries' <i>Vetusta Monumenta</i> (c. 1789).  This early contact with Gothic art profoundly affected Blake's later work as an artist and his writings on the history of art.</p><p>Shortly after his release from apprenticeship in 1779, Blake began to develop a series of designs picturing major events in the history of England (Objects 7-12). He exhibited one of these, <i>The Death of Earl Goodwin</i> (Object 9) or a more finished version of the design, at the Royal Academy in 1780. This group of pictures may have culminated in ""The History of England, a small book of Engravings,"" advertised in Blake's prospectus <i>To the Public</i> in October 1793. Unfortunately, no copy of that work has ever been recorded. Blake developed at least one work in this series, <i>Pestilence, Probably the Great Plague of London</i> (Object 12), into a slightly larger and more finished water color (Object 14). <i>Lear and Cordelia</i> (Butlin 53) was probably executed as part of the history of England series but is presented in the Archive under Water Color Drawings, Illustrations to Shakespeare.</p><p>Blake's early water colors include several designs with biblical subjects (Objects 6, 13, 15, 18, 20-23, 27). The most highly finished and important of these are three illustrations to the story of Joseph and his brethren recounted in Genesis (Objects 20, 22, 23). These were exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1785. One year earlier, Blake's <i>A Breach in a City, the Morning after the Battle</i> (Object 19), had appeared at the same venue. Blake was trying, by the mid-1780s, to establish his reputation as a ""history"" painter&mdash;that is, as a specialist in themes taken from history, the Bible, and canonical literary texts such as Milton's <i>Paradise Lost</i>. In the eighteenth century, such subjects were believed to be appropriate for the greatest artistic ambitions, but all of Blake's exhibited works were in water colors rather than the more highly regarded medium of oil painting.</p><p>Almost all of Blake's water colors fit comfortably within the long tradition of water color <i>drawing</i>, in which one delineates form by line and the tinting is confined within firm outlines. Water color <i>painting</i>, a style developed by artists such as J. M. W. Turner, allowed for a freer use of washes, unconfined by pen and ink or pencil boundaries and without underlying washes laid in for modeling.",1780swc.info.xml,1,"but5.1,but7.1,but8.1,but9.1,but10.1,but75.1,but51.1,but52.1,but60.1,but62.1,but64.1,but184.1,but109.1,but185.1,but127.1,but133r.1,but96.1,but144.1,but191.1,but155.1,but158.1,but156.1,but157.1,but87r.1,but88r.1,but91.1,but258.1",0,  
Illustrations to Shakespeare,wc,c. 1779-c. 1825,1779,shakespearewc.jpg,,shakespearewc,"<p>Although less extensive and well known than his illustrations of John Milton's poems, Blake's water colors based on Shakespeare's plays constitute a significant group of designs. The earliest, dating from c. 1779 (Butlin 53), is probably one of Blake's illustrations of English history but nonetheless evokes Shakespeare's <i>King Lear</i>. The series of seven small ovals picturing characters from the plays also dates from Blake's early years (Butlin 84). The concentrated focus on just one or two figures filling most of the pictorial space may be Blake's response to popular interest in miniature portraiture. The reason for his execution of this group is not known; like the English history designs, they may have been intended for eventual publication as engravings. The series of Shakespeare character portraits by John Hamilton Mortimer, published as engravings in the mid-1770s, may have influenced Blake's similar project.</p><p><i>Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing</i> (Butlin 161) is one of Blake's largest water colors of the 1780s. Its size and quality suggest that it may have been intended for exhibition, like the water colors illustrating the life of Joseph displayed at the Royal Academy in 1785. The circle of dancers and Puck's stance with arms raised echo similar motifs in George Romney's <i>Leveson-Gower Family</i>, painted in 1776-77 and published as a mezzotint by John Raphael Smith in 1781.</p><p>Blake was clearly attracted to the vision of Queen Katherine in <i>Henry VIII</i>, act 4, scene 2, for he executed four versions beginning c. 1783-90 and concluding with the highly finished and complex water color of c. 1825-26 (Butlin 247, 547.3, 548, and 549). His interest in the subject, and perhaps features of his later renditions, may have been influenced by Henry Fuseli's painting exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1781 or the slightly different version engraved by Francesco Bartolozzi in 1788. Blake's water color of Queen Katherine's dream dated 1809 is part of a series of six illustrations (Butlin 547) to Shakespeare's plays commissioned by Joseph Thomas, the clergyman who had earlier employed Blake to illustrate Milton's <i>Comus</i> and <i>Paradise Lost</i>. In a letter of 31 July 1801 to William Hayley, John Flaxman added a postscript to Blake, including the following: ""he [Thomas] also desired you [Blake] will make two designs in bister or Indian Ink, from Shakespeare's Troylus &amp; Cressida, Coriolanus, either of the 3 plays of Henry 6.<sup>th</sup> Richard the 3.<sup>d</sup> or Henry the 8.<sup>th</sup> each design for one play for which he will give a Guinea each, the dimensions as follow the paper. an upright square of 12 Inches &amp; half by 8 Inches, within this Space leaving a moderate margin, the principal figure not exceeding 6 Inches high"" (Butlin 547). Blake's designs (most now trimmed) roughly follow these size requirements, necessitated by Thomas's desire to create an extra-illustrated copy of the 1632 second folio of Shakespeare's plays, but Blake waited eight years before completing the commission, changed the medium from monochrome drawings to water colors, and illustrated only two plays, <i>Richard III</i> and <i>Henry VIII</i>, specified by Flaxman. Blake may have chosen the other passages for illustration, at some point convincing Thomas of their appropriateness.</p><p>Many of Blake's Shakespeare designs show his predilection for scenes dealing with perceptions that extend beyond the world of the physical senses. The four versions of Queen Katherine's dream epitomize this lifelong interest in imaginative and visionary experiences. A corollary is Blake's attraction to representations of the arts, demonstrated by <i>Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing</i> and his portrayal of Pegasus, the classical embodiment of poetic inspiration, in <i>As If an Angel Dropped Down from the Clouds</i> among the designs for Thomas (Butlin 547.6).",shakespearewc.info.xml,1,"but53.1,but84.1,but247.1,but161.1,but246.1,but547.1,but548.1,but549.1",0,
The Poetical Works of Geoffrey Chaucer,comeng,1783,1783,bb442.1.1.com.100.jpg,bb442.1,bb442,"<p>This small plate, engraved by Blake after a design by Thomas Stothard, is the engraved title page to volume 13 of <i>The Poetical Works of Geoffrey Chaucer</i>, published as part of John Bell's edition of <i>The Poets of Great Britain Complete from Chaucer to Churchill</i> issued in 109 volumes between 1777 and 1787. The letterpress title page is dated 1782 but Blake's engraving is dated 1783.</p><p>The roundel design illustrates ""a balade whiche Chaucer made in the praise or rather dispreise of women for their doublenes"" (page 106). In the eighteenth century this text was believed to have been authored by Chaucer, but modern scholars have rejected this attribution. The passage illustrated, lines 81-84 on page 109, refers to the biblical story of Samson and Delilah. In Stothard's design, Samson rests his head in Delilah's lap just after his locks were shorn by the Philistines (Judges 16: 19). Only this central design can be attributed with certainty to Stothard and Blake. The frame may have been designed and executed by others. Blake's water color of c. 1800-03, <i>Samson Subdued</i> (Butlin 455), is based on the same passage in Judges but the figures are differently configured and arranged.</p><p>In some copies of volume 13 a different plate of the same design is signed by ""Cooke"" as the engraver&mdash;probably the J. Cook who engraved other title pages in Bell's <i>Poets</i>. Later issues contain Cook's plate.</p>",bb442.info.xml,0,,1,
"Illustrations to John Bunyan's ""The Pilgrim's Progress""",wc,c. 1824-27,1824.B,but829.1.1.wc.300.jpg,but829.1,but829,"<p>It's not surprising that Blake would illustrate <i>The Pilgrim's Progress</i>, second only to the Bible as the most read book in Britain and America in Blake's time, but it's difficult to determine his motivation for taking on the project and the designs raise several questions that are hard to answer. Part one of Bunyan's allegorical tale was described on the title page as ""the similitude of a dream"" when first published in 1678. Blake began work on his illustrations no earlier than 1824 and left them unfinished upon his death in August 1827.</p> <p>In the last four years of his life, Blake was busy with several major projects, including the final stages of engraving his twenty-two illustrations to the Book of Job, the 102 water color and seven engraved illustrations to Dante's <i>Divine Comedy</i>, an illustrated manuscript of Genesis, and the printing and detailed coloring of five copies of <i>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</i> with a total of 270 plates. In light of these undertakings and Blake's increasing bouts of illness, it is difficult to believe that he would further burden himself with the task of illustrating <i>The Pilgrim's Progress</i> on speculation-that is, without a commission but in the hope of finding a purchaser. John Linnell, who commissioned the Job and Dante projects, would seem to be a logical candidate, but there is no record of his involvement. Object 20, <i>Christian with the Shield of Faith, Taking Leave of His Companions,</i> was acquired, possibly as early as 1827, by Elizabeth (Mrs. Charles) Aders, a friend of Linnell's who met Blake no later than August 1825 and in December acquired from him <i>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</i> Copy AA. She may have commissioned the entire <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i> group but kept only one of the few designs with fine, albeit incomplete, coloring by Blake. Aders apparently rejected the remaining designs or returned them to Blake's widow, Catherine, because of their unfinished condition. The first written reference to the existence of the Bunyan designs, lacking only the one retained by Aders, is in the catalogue of Sotheby's auction of 29 April 1862, lot 187, ""a series of twenty-eight designs for The Pilgrim's Progress."" The large number of works by Blake in this sale, offered anonymously ""from the cabinet of an amateur"" and possibly other vendors, were once in Frederick Tatham's possession, although with an intervening collector and/or dealer. Tatham acquired Blake's works remaining in his estate by inheritance or gift in 1831 from Catherine Blake. Thus it seems probable that either the Bunyan water colors were executed without a patron or they are the product of a commission from Aders never completed.</p> <p>William Michael Rossetti, in his catalogue of Blake's works published in the 1863 edition of Alexander Gilchrist's <i>Life of William Blake</i>, claimed that the Bunyan designs were ""much injured by the handiwork of Mrs. Blake, the colour being untidy-looking and heavy for the most part, and crude where strength is intended. Two of the designs, at any rate, may be considered untouched by Mrs. Blake"" (volume 2, page 235). Subsequent scholars have taken a less harsh view of the coloring, but most have accepted the idea that Catherine Blake, probably after her husband's death, tinted many of the designs or at least substantially augmented coloring already executed by him. Attributions of the coloring of each design are briefly noted in Butlin 829.1-29. In the list below of each object we quote or summarize Butlin's comments and add our own opinions about the attribution of the coloring to either William or Catherine Blake. These observations on coloring are also presented in the Editors' Notes to each object.</p> <p>Object 1: Butlin states that the coloring was ""more or less finished by [William] Blake himself.""

The rainbow may be by William, but we attribute most, possibly all, of the other coloring to Catherine.</p> <p>Object 11: Butlin implies that William colored the design, ""with only a few outlines touched in in [sic] ink by a later hand."" We attribute the coloring to William and the ink outlining to Catherine.</p> <p>Object 12: Butlin states that the design was ""left very unfinished by Blake but the cage heavily gone over in black and the figures touched-up"" by another hand. We attribute most, possibly all, of the coloring to Catherine.</p> <p>Object 13: Butlin states that ""both figures and setting have been heavily gone over [by another hand] to produce a finished watercolour, though the granular treatment of the flesh may be Blake's."" We attribute most, possibly all, of the coloring to Catherine.</p> <p>Object 14: Butlin states that the design, presumably including the coloring, is ""entirely by Blake apart from some possible reinforcement in the dark blues."" We attribute most, possibly all, of the coloring to Catherine.</p> <p>Object 15: Butlin states that there is ""some touching-up [by another hand] on Christian's outlines; also the mauve edge of the leading Shining One's wing."" We attribute most of the coloring to Catherine, but the blue sky may have been colored by William.</p> <p>Object 16: Butlin states that the design, presumably including the coloring, is ""largely by Blake though ink outlines probably added"" by another hand. We attribute most, possibly all, of the coloring to Catherine.</p> <p>Object 17: Butlin states that the design was ""finished by Blake with the exception of the rainbow which seems to have been reinforced by another hand."" We attribute the coloring to both William and Catherine.</p> <p>Object 18: Butlin states that the design was ""finished by Blake with only slight reinforcement in pen"" by another hand. We attribute most, possibly all, of the coloring to Catherine.</p> <p>Object 19: Butlin states that the design was ""lightly sketched and coloured by Blake. Prudence and the portcullis have been reinforced [by another hand?] and a streaky sky introduced into the solid architecture above the gateway. The penwork on Christian himself is probably original."" We attribute most, possibly all, of the coloring to Catherine.</p><p>Object 20: Butlin states that the design ""escaped the going-over [by another hand] suffered by most of the rest of the series."" We attribute the unfinished coloring to William.</p> <p>Object 21: Butlin states that the design has been ""heavily gone over in all parts,"" presumably by another hand. We attribute most, possibly all, of the coloring to Catherine.</p> <p>Object 22: Butlin states that the design was ""left unfinished by Blake, with some subsequent reinforcement in pen of Christian's head, the outlines of the main figures and the architectural forms behind."" We concur and attribute this ""subsequent"" work to Catherine. We also attribute to her the black coloring of the trees along the left and right margins.</p> <p>Object 23: Butlin states that the design was ""left largely unfinished by Blake in pencil and delicate washes, though the colouring of the right-hand mountebank may also be his; the quartering and heavy outlines of the other one were almost certainly added later."" We attribute most, possibly all, of the coloring to Catherine.</p> <p>Object 24: Butlin states that the design is ""unfinished, with outlines reinforced in pen or point of brush and some strengthening of colour in the flames"" by another hand. We attribute most, possibly all, of the coloring to Catherine.</p> <p>Object 25: Butlin states that ""all the outlines have been gone over and the greys, which fill most of the background, have probably been reinforced"" by another hand. We attribute most, possibly all, of the coloring to Catherine.</p> <p>Object 26: Butlin states that ""the outlines of the figures have been reinforced in ink [by another hand], and the colour of the sky and the tone of the architectural landscape are probably not original. ""We attribute most, possibly all, of the coloring to Catherine.</p> <p>Object 27: Butlin states that ""the heads and outlines have been reinforced in pen and ink [by another hand]. The colour of the sky has probably been added; it clashes with the tones of the four shepherds."" We attribute the coloring to both William and Catherine.</p> <p>Object 28: Butlin states that the design was ""left unfinished by Blake and miraculously free from later accretions."" The coloring of the foliage may have been added by Catherine.</p> <p>Object 29: Butlin states that ""the heads of Christian and Hopeful and their two attendant angels have been reinforced in pen and ink, and, although the rainbow-like bands of colour running through the figures are Blake's, some of the heavier touches of colour on the angels' wings may have been added"" by another hand. We attribute the coloring of the background, lower left, and the landscape at the bottom to Catherine.</p> <p>In addition to Blake's own inscription within the design of Object 10, the margins and versos of Blake's water colors bear several inscriptions in pencil, both numbers (apparently an attempt to sequence the designs) and captions or titles above and below the designs. Transcriptions are given in Butlin 829.1-29, in G. E. Bentley, Jr., ""The Inscriptions on Blake's Designs to <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>,"" <i>Blake Newsletter</i> 6.2 (fall 1972): 68-70, and in Sotheby's auction catalogue of 14 November 1996, lot 253.With the exception of the title above the design of Object 23, these inscriptions are not shown in the Archive's reproductions. We quote Butlin's transcriptions in the Editors' Notes to each object. Butlin suggests ""that some at least of the numbers may have been the work of Blake himself"" and tentatively attributes the long inscription top right on Object 2 to Blake, but does not attribute what he calls the ""usual hand"" that wrote all others. Bentley attributes all the inscriptions to Frederick Tatham, but in our view his authorship is questionable.</p> <p>Blake produced one further illustration to <i>The Pilgrim's Progress</i>, a white-line etching titled <i>The Man Sweeping the Interpreter's Parlour</i>, based on a famous passage contrasting the harsh laws of the Old Testament to the salvific forgiveness of the New. The print probably dates from c. 1822 and thus at about the same time that the circle of young artists, including Samuel Palmer and George Richmond, who gathered around Blake in his final years began to refer to his dwelling as ""the house of the Interpreter,"" clearly an allusion to Bunyan's text and possibly to the print as well. In ""A Vision of the Last Judgment"" that he wrote in his Notebook c. 1810, Blake comments as follows on <i>The Pilgrim's Progress</i>: ""Note here that Fable or Allegory is Seldom without some Vision Pilgrims Progress is full of it..."" (Erdman page 554). Perhaps Blake intended his illustrations to expand the viewer's mental state and thereby perceive the imaginative ""Vision"" within Bunyan's allegory, the ""dream"" within the ""similitude.""</p>",but829.info.xml,0,,0,
Virgil Relief Etching,spb,1820,1820.A,bbwba504.1.6-9.sp.100.jpg,bbwba504.1,bbwba504,"<p>When planning a third edition of his successful school text, <i>The Pastorals of Virgil</i>, Robert John Thornton employed Blake to contribute some of the new designs for the two-volume work. Among his many other endeavors, Thornton was the physician for Blake's patron John Linnell, who probably played a key role in securing the commission. Blake's assignment was to illustrate Ambrose Philips' English ""imitation"" of Virgil's first eclogue.</p><p>Blake first produced four small designs as relief etchings on a single copperplate. This work, the unique impression of which was unknown until 1990, is reproduced here. Blake was again attempting to integrate one of his unconventional graphic techniques into a commercial project, just as he had tried but failed in 1805 to produce white-line etchings as illustrations for Robert Cromek's new edition of Robert Blair's <i>The Grave</i> (see the separate plate of <i>Deaths Door</i>).</p><p>The relief-etched Virgil plate was rejected by Thornton. There may have been several reasons, including the unconventional style of etching, the semi-nudity of some of the figures, and the difficulties letterpress printers would have encountered with such an unusual matrix. Apparently Blake was asked to prepare wood engravings, a medium in which he had never before worked, instead of relief etchings. His next step was to execute a series of preliminary pencil, pen and ink, and wash drawings, the basis of the wood engravings printed in the 1821 edition of <i>The Pastorals of Virgil</i>.For the attribution of this work to Blake and further discussion of the relationship among the Virgil drawings, the wood engravings, and this relief etching, see Robert N. Essick, ""A Relief Etching of Blake's Virgil Illustrations,"" <i>Blake: An Illustrated Quarterly</i>, 25.3 (winter 1991-92): 117-27.",bbwba504.info.xml,0,,0,

Bunyan explains his allegory as a representation of how the Law (the man sweeping) is unable to dispel Sin (the dust), but the Gospel of the New Testament (the female angel laying the dust with water) can overcome Sin.</p><p>The plate is probably a ""Woodcut on Copper"" but might be a ""Woodcut on Pewter."" Blake described both processes in his Notebook (Erdman page 694). There are reasonable arguments for dating at least the first state of the plate to two very different periods of Blake's career, the mid-1790s and the 1820s. The majority of the evidence tends to favor c. 1822 for the execution of both states&mdash;see Essick pages 108-09 for discussion of the pertinent issues. The only known impression of the first state is in an American private collection and not available for reproduction.</p><p>Blake appears to have regularly prepared to-size preliminary drawings for transfer to the plates of his white-line metal cuts, but there are no recorded preliminary or related drawings for <i>The Man Sweeping</i>. His c. 1824-27 water color illustrations of <i>The Pilgrim's Progress</i> (Butlin 829), left incomplete at Blake's death, do not include a design based on the passage illustrated by <i>The Man Sweeping</i>.",esxx.info.xml,0,,0,

The personification of Mirth is of course the central and largest figure, surrounded by personifications of the various forms of humor and emotional states named by Milton, including ""Laughter"" (the figure holding his sides right of Mirth's torso) and ""wrinkled Care"" (the male figure left of Mirth's right shoulder).</p><p>The first state of the plate, executed in line and stipple, was probably produced shortly after the watercolor. The graphic style is well within the compass of conventional tastes of the time and may have been intended as a commercially viable work. The second state is a complete stylistic transformation, converting the design into a line etching/engraving with dramatic contrasts of darkness and illumination. These characteristics, plus the addition of inscriptions, are typical of Blake's revisions of several of his earlier prints c. 1820-25. The inscription below the design is quoted in part from Ecclesiastes 1:2 or 12.8.",esxviii.info.xml,0,,0,
The Chaining of Orc,spb,1812,1812.A,esxvii.1-1a.1.sp.100.jpg,esxvii.1-1a,esxvii,"<p>The text of <i>Vala</i>, or <i>The Four Zoas</i>, accompanying a design generally similar to <i>The Chaining of Orc</i>, identifies the figures. Orc, the spirit of revolution, has been chained to a rock by his father, Los. He repents the deed while Orc's mother, Enitharmon, weeps in sorrow (Erdman page 342).</p><p>It is extremely difficult to determine the graphic technique (or techniques) Blake used to create <i>The Chaining of Orc</i>. The word ""Type"" in the inscription is good evidence that the print is&mdash;at least in part&mdash;a copperplate relief etching because Blake calls the plates for his illuminated books ""types"" on Plate 3 of <i>Jerusalem</i> and refers to his first relief etching as a ""Stereotype"" at the end of <i>The Ghost of Abel</i> (Erdman pages 145, 272). Further, some of the darker areas left of Orc's head appear to be embossed into the paper, suggesting that these were printed from small relief plateaus. None of Blake's other relief etchings shows the fine, stipple-like textures visible in both recessed and relief areas on the plate. This effect may have been produced by some form of sand-grain aquatint. Alternatively, the textures might have been produced by inking both relief and recessed areas with an inking ball lightly charged with very thick, tacky ink.",esxvii.info.xml,0,,0,
Chaucers Canterbury Pilgrims,spb,1810,1810.A,esxvi.1-1a.1.sp.100.jpg,"esxvi.1-1a,esxvi.2-2c,esxvi.3-3i,esxvi.4-4dd",esxvi,"<p>Blake included his tempera painting of <i>Sir Geoffrey Chaucer and the Nine and Twenty Pilgrims on Their Journey to Canterbury</i> (Butlin 653) in his 1809 exhibition. The <i>Descriptive Catalogue</i> for the exhibit includes a long, detailed description of the work and defense of its style and historical accuracy. Blake's engraving of this design&mdash;his largest and most ambitious&mdash;is dated 1810 in its imprint. There are at least four (possibly five) states of the plate. The first, known in a single impression, includes the 1810 imprint and other inscriptions but may be a proof never issued by Blake. The second state, datable to the same year, exists in only two impressions, both at least partly hand colored, possibly by Blake or his wife Catherine. The considerably darkened third state probably also dates from 1810 and can be considered the finished state of the plate at that time. The characteristics of the fourth state, with its burnished highlights and scratched inscriptions referring to war, money, and politics, indicate that it was produced late in Blake's career, c. 1820-25. The final (fifth) state of the plate may not be a true ""state,"" as properly defined, but simply later impressions of the fourth state after the scratched inscriptions had worn off the copperplate. Posthumous impressions were printed by the London art dealer Colnaghi over many years, beginning in 1881. The Philadelphia book dealer Charles Sessler printed more impressions in 1941. The original copperplate is now in the Yale University Art Gallery,  New Haven, Connecticut.</p><p>Blake's design was embroiled in controversy even before he executed the engraving. Who first had the idea of producing a panoramic view of Chaucer's Pilgrims setting off on their journey? John Thomas Smith, writing in 1828, contended that late in 1805 Robert H. Cromek, the publisher of the 1808 edition of Robert Blair's <i>The Grave</i> with Blake's illustrations, saw Blake's sketches for his Chaucer painting and subsequently commissioned Thomas Stothard to paint the same subject (Bentley, <i>Records</i>, page 614). His painting was exhibited at Cromek's house two years before Blake's 1809 exhibition and Cromek planned to publish an engraving of it. Blake was harshly critical of Stothard's picture in <i>A Descriptive Catalogue</i>. Smith also offers Stothard's version of the story, one in which Blake visited Stothard while the latter was working on his design, with the implication that Blake was prompted to execute what he thought would be a more historically accurate rendition of the pilgrims (Bentley, <i>Records</i>, pages 614-15). Cromek, in a letter of 1807, claimed that the idea for the Chaucer design was his (Bentley, <i>Records</i>, page 235). The engraving of Stothard's design was not completed until 1817.

Enoch,spb,c. 1806-07,1806.A,esxv.1-1a.1.sp.100.jpg,esxv.1-1a,esxv,"<p><i>Enoch</i> is Blake's only lithograph, the graphic technique of drawing and printing from a stone matrix invented in the mid-1790s by Alois Senefelder in Germany. Blake's production of <i>Enoch</i> was very probably connected with the reissues of <i>Specimens of Polyautography</i> in 1806 and 1807 by Georg Jacob Vollweiler, owner of the English patent for polyautographs (as lithographs were then called). Vollweiler lent lithographic stones to a number of artists, apparently including Blake, but <i>Enoch</i> was not included in <i>Specimens</i>. Only five impressions are known; four are on buff (light beige) or light chocolate brown wove paper of a type used by Vollweiler for lithographs by other artists. The impression on buff paper at Northwestern University Library has a watermark dated 1806. The pencil sketch generally titled <i>In Maiden Meditation, Fancy-Free</i> (Butlin 582 recto and verso) might be a preliminary drawing for <i>Enoch</i>.</p><p>A pen and ink inscription by George Cumberland on the verso of the copy of <i>Enoch</i> now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, describes Blake's introduction of his own techniques into the lithographic process. According to Cumberland, Blake did not use lithographic ink or crayon to draw his design but substituted a mixture of asphaltum and linseed oil. Even when introduced to a new graphic process, Blake could not resist further experimentation.</p><p>The Hebrew inscription&mdash;""Enoch""&mdash;on the open book held by the central, patriarchal figure identifies him as the father of Methuselah and the great-grandfather of Noah. He is surrounded by representatives of music, painting, and poetry. The Hebrew inscription on the tablet held by the youthful male hovering on the right is from Genesis 5:24, ""And Enoch walked with God&hellip;."" Eusebius and other early theologians, both Christian and Jewish, credited Enoch with the invention of writing and considered him to have been a divinely inspired instructor in many fields of learning.</p><p>Late in his life, c. 1824-27, Blake drew five pencil sketches illustrating an English translation of the Ethiopian Book of Enoch (Butlin 827). This project is distinct from the <i>Enoch</i> lithograph and does not contain a similar design.",esxv.info.xml,0,,0, 
Experimental Relief Plate,spb,c. 1805-22,1805.B,esxiv.1-1a.1.sp.100.jpg,"esxiv.1-1a,esxiv.2-1b",esxiv,"<p>Almost everything about this relief and white-line etching remains uncertain, including the reason for its execution, its iconography, and its date. There are only two known impressions, both on the same type of paper and thus probably printed at the same time, one inked in relief and one inked in intaglio&mdash;that is, with the etched recesses inked and the relief surfaces cleaned. The leg, torso, and arm positions of the headless figures are nearly identical to those of the rising youth in Blake's white-line etching <i>Deaths Door</i> of 1805 but differ from earlier versions of this figure type in Blake's art. The plate might have some connection with Blake's plans to write an ""account of [his] various Inventions in Art"" (letter to George Cumberland of 19 Dec. 1808, Erdman page 770). The two impressions could be used to demonstrate the differences between relief and intaglio printing. The stipple-like texturing on the legs of the repeated figure do not appear again in Blake's relief etchings until Plate 2 of <i>The Ghost of Abel</i> (1822). Given these parallels and possibilities, a wide date range of c. 1805-22 seems advisable.</p><p>Blake's method of relief etching required him to build a border of wax around his plate before pouring acid on it. The area beneath the wax remained in relief and, when inked as it is in the first impression reproduced here, printed as a border around the entire plate. The presence of such a border at the top of the plate when printed in relief indicates that the upper figure, like his twin below, was originally etched headless.",esxiv.info.xml,0,,0,
Moore & Co.'s Advertisement,spb,c. 1797-98,1797.A,esxii.1.1.sp.100.jpg,esxii.1,esxii,"<p>As his signature (""Blake. d. &amp; sc:"") on the plate indicates, Blake both designed and engraved most of the <i>Moore &amp; Co's Advertisement</i>. A preliminary pencil sketch (Butlin 340 verso) shows that Blake designed all the motifs below the clouds at the top. The Royal Arms top center and the feathers (left) and coat of arms (right) of the Prince of Wales are of course not of Blake's own invention. The inscription between the columns and the Latin quotation from Martial below the design were probably executed by an anonymous writing engraver; the references to the ""Loom[s]"" and ""Frame"" and the signature immediately below the design were scratched in drypoint by Blake. London directories list Moore &amp; Co. only for the years 1797 and 1798. Thus, a date of c. 1797-98 seems probable for Blake's etching/engraving.</p><p>Blake may have been known to Moore &amp; Co. through his family's hosiery and haberdashery business, continued by his brother James until about 1812 (Bentley, <i>Records</i>, pages 7-8). The carpet rollers lower left and center may have reminded Blake of his own rolling press, a machine which in turn influenced images in his later poetry such as ""a wheel to turn the cogs of the adverse wheel"" (<i>Milton a Poem</i>, Erdman page 124). There are only two traced impressions of the plate. Even if originally printed in substantial numbers, most impressions of ephemera such as the Moore advertisement are destroyed or discarded and thus become scarce after a few decades and exceedingly rare after two centuries.",esxii.info.xml,0,,0, 
Albion rose,spb,1795,1795.A,esvii.1-1b.1.sp.100.jpg,"esvii.1-1b,esvii.2-2d",esvii,"<p>In 1795 Blake cut a large copperplate, 39.4 x 54.4 cm., into four equal pieces. He used one of these quarters to etch and engrave the first state of <i>Albion rose</i>&mdash;a title based on the inscription on the second (final) state of the plate. There is no recorded intaglio printing of the first state, but in the same year Blake printed two impressions in colors from the surface of the plate. In 1796 he incorporated the first of these impressions into <i>A Large Book of Designs</i> Copy A. The second impression, more lightly colored, is reproduced here. Fortunately, some of the underlying etched and engraved lines are visible. These show that several features of the final state, including the lines of radiance emanating from the figure, the worm near his left foot, and the bat-winged moth flying between his feet had not yet been executed on the plate. The color printing in both impressions obscures the areas where the signature and date and the inscription below the design appear in the final state.</p><p>Late in his career, c. 1820-25, Blake returned to some of his earlier separate plates to revise them both visually, through the addition of dramatic contrasts of darkness and illumination, and thematically through the addition of inscriptions. The revisions to <i>Albion rose</i> included the motifs noted above, the inscription below the design, and possibly the ""WB"" signature and date. In the first state of the plate, the figure may represent mankind transformed and energized by the French Revolution. In the second state, the inscription identifies him as Albion, Blake's representative of humanity in his later poetry, in a Christ-like act of self-sacrifice that lifts him above the creatures of darkness. The date, ""inv 1780,"" memorializes Blake's invention, and first execution, of the figure in a pencil drawing datable to that year (Butlin 73). Embossed vertical lines in this sketch indicate that Blake counterproofed it onto the copperplate of <i>Albion rose</i>. The date may also have a biographical significance because 1780 was Blake's first full year as an independent artist after his release from apprenticeship under the engraver James Basire. A further personal connection between the final state of <i>Albion rose</i> and Blake's life is suggested by his letter to William Hayley of 23 Oct. 1804 in which he states that he had been ""a slave bound in a mill among beasts and devils"" but now is ""again enlightened with the light [he] enjoyed in [his] youth"" (Erdman page 756).",esvii.info.xml,0,,0,

Satan directs the Pope, wearing his triple crown, towards the hellish region lower left to which three monarchs and their attendant soldiers have already been confined. At least two ghostly faces of other damned souls hover to the right of the Pope, whose face is a caricature of King George III, head of the Church of England just as the Pope is the head of the Roman Catholic church. The date of the plate is uncertain, but can reasonably be ascribed to c. 1794 based on both its political theme and its graphic style.</p><p>There are only three extant impressions of <i>Lucifer and the Pope in Hell</i>. The first is a working proof, lacking many of the etched and engraved lines of the second (finished) state, including the pupils of Lucifer's eyes. Although visible only in a raking light, fine pencil lines cover the lower half of the Pope's gown. Some of these pencil lines accord with additions to the finished state and were very probably drawn by Blake. Both the proof and the second state were probably printed shortly after the plate was boldly etched and engraved c. 1794.

Both are among the ""Series of subjects from the Bible"" Blake announced in his prospectus <i>To the Public</i> of 1793, although only <i>Job</i> is specifically listed. The only extant impressions of <i>Ezekiel</i> include the extensive burnishing and dramatic contrasts between darkness and illumination typical of Blake's revisions of his earlier separate plates late in his career, c. 1820-25. Thus, all known impressions are in the second state of the plate.

A more finished version of this design, dateable to c. 1793, became the basis for his large etching/engraving of 1793. Job is shown in despair, beseeching God with eyes and hands turned upward, his wife huddled at his side and his supposed friends on the left offering accusation more than succor. Blake included the subject of this separate plate and its basic format in all his later series of Job illustrations. This composition, or at least its subject and emotional expression, may have been influenced by James Barry's <i>Job Reproved by His Friends</i>, an engraving of 1777. The size, lettering, and graphic style of Blake's <i>Ezekiel</i> separate plate of 1794 indicate that it was executed as a companion to <i>Job</i>.

Edward & Elenor,spb,1793,1793.C,esiv.1-1b.1.sp.100.jpg,esiv.1-1b,esiv,"<p>Blake's considerable interest in the history of England as the basis for pictures is demonstrated by a group of water colors executed between c. 1779 and 1793 (Butlin 51-69), a list of subjects he wrote in his Notebook c. 1790-93 (Object 118, Erdman page 672), ""The History of England, a small book of Engravings"" advertised in Blake's prospectus <i>To the Public</i> (1793), and this large separate plate of <i>Edward &amp; Elenor</i>, also advertised in <i>To the Public</i> and dated 1793 in its imprint. No copy of the ""small book of Engravings"" has ever been recorded, and thus <i>Edward &amp; Elenor</i> is Blake's only original print based on England's history.</p><p>This etching/engraving depicts a famous incident in the life of King Edward I as told in Rapin de Thoyras, <i>History of England</i> (1723-31). During the siege of Acre, Edward was wounded by a would-be assassin's poison-tipped arrow. Queen Elenor (or Eleanor) is shown sucking the poison from the wound, thereby saving the King's life.  Blake's interest in this episode may have been stimulated by his apprenticeship drawings of Edward's coffin and Elenor's tomb in Westminster Abbey (Butlin 1, 2, 23-25). The foreshortened space of the design and the frieze-like arrangement of figures bespeak Blake's response to the neoclassical styles of the 1780s and early 1790s. More specifically, the composition shows the influence of John Hamilton Mortimer, whose work Blake admired.</p><p>There is only one other traced impression of <i>Edward &amp; Elenor</i>.

This second impression, more thinly color printed than the first, is reproduced here. Fragments of a text can be seen right of the descending child. These are parts of a text of six lines more clearly printed as a blind embossment on the verso of this impression (see the Diplomatic Transcription and Supplemental Views). Both text and design were very probably first produced as part of <i>America a Prophecy</i> (1793), but like three other plates it was not published in any copy of the illuminated book. The width of the plate is the same as several others in <i>America</i>, the lettering style and size are the same as in the illuminated book, and the reference in the text to the ""British Colonies"" is consistent with the subject of <i>America</i>. The design was probably below the text on the <i>America</i> copperplate as originally constituted. To create this separate print, Blake either cut the plate or masked it with a piece of paper along its top edge.</p><p>The design can be interpreted as an illustration to the text still on the plate: the bent figure on the right is the dreaming Thiralatha and the standing figure on the left is a dream projection of her self grasping, and perhaps kissing, one of the personified ""joyful images."" Thiralatha is also named in <i>Europe a Prophecy</i> (1794), Plate 17, where she is grouped with Sotha as one of the ""secret dwellers of dreamful caves"" (Erdman page 66).

In its first state, dated 1793 in the imprint, the inscription reads ""Our End is come."" The three figures&mdash;a crowned monarch guarded by two armed soldiers&mdash;represent the old order about to be swept away by the forces of revolution.  Although not a comic caricature print of the type made famous by Blake's contemporary James Gillray, this first state of what would later become <i>The Accusers</i> participates in the political controversies of the 1790s, a conflict waged with both words and images.  The only known impression of the first state is bound as the frontispiece to <i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i> Copy B.</p><p>When Blake printed Copy A of <i>A Large Book of Designs</i> for Ozias Humphry in 1796, he apparently pulled a second impression of each plate to build up his stock of images. The second impression of <i>The Accusers</i>, printed in colors from the surface of the copperplate, reveals a good many of the underlying incised lines, particularly in the floor and along the right side of the plate. These indicate that the horizontal hatching lines on the wooden post on the right, visible in the third state, have been incised into the copper, but that other third-state alterations, including the laurel wreath adorning the figure on the right, have not yet been executed. Thus, the color printed impression reproduced here represents an intermediate, second state of the plate. There is no known intaglio impression of this second state, but it is probably the same as the now untraced impression that Edward W. Hooper exhibited at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts in 1891. The exhibition catalogue records the same imprint as the first state, but a new title inscription: ""When the senses are shaken / And the soul is driven to madness Page 56"" (<i>Exhibition of Books, Water Colors, Engravings, Etc. by William Blake</i>, Boston Museum of Fine Arts, Feb. 7-15 March 1891, page 33). The page reference is to the opening lines of the ""Prologue"" to ""King Edward the Fourth"" on page 56 of Blake's <i>Poetical Sketches</i> (1783): ""O for a voice like thunder, and a tongue / To drown the throat of war!-When the senses / Are shaken, and the soul is driven to madness"" (Erdman page 439). Fragments of this inscription are visible in some impressions of the third state, thereby confirming the transcription in the 1891 catalogue. The page reference inscribed in the second state, executed between 1793 and its color printing in 1796, would be cryptic to anyone not familiar with Blake's first, privately published, book of poems. Perhaps he planned to use the plate as an illustration accompanying a copy of <i>Poetical Sketches</i> or a new edition of ""King Edward the Fourth."" The second state inscription does not radically alter the iconography of the print, although it might be argued that Blake is now emphasizing the horrors of revolutionary war rather than its goals.</p><p>Late in his career, c. 1820-25, Blake returned to some of his earlier separate plates to revise them both visually, through the addition of dramatic contrasts of darkness and illumination, and thematically through the addition of inscriptions. With his extensive revisions in the third state of <i>The Accusers</i>, Blake has changed the meaning of the design. The addition of a laurel wreath to the soldier on the right implicates imperial Rome in Blake's critique of state power. As the new title inscription indicates, the setting is no longer the revolutionary conflicts of Blake's era but ""A Scene in the Last Judgment."" The figures are now ""Accusers"" who charge the innocent with theft, adultery, and murder. The title universalizes the scene but the emphasis on false accusation may have been motivated by Blake's personal experiences. In 1803, the soldier John Scolfield accused Blake of making seditious remarks against Britain's king.  Blake was acquitted in the next year, but false accusation soon became a leitmotif in Blake's writings. In a letter to William Hayley of 28 May 1804, Blake states that ""in London every calumny and falsehood utter'd against another of the same trade is thought fair play. Engravers, Painters, Statuaries, Printers, Poets, we are not in a field of battle, but in a City of Assassinations"" (Erdman page 751).

Blake then surrounded the printed image with India ink wash, slightly grayer than the black printing solution. Some of this wash also appears on the figures, notably the knees, lower legs, and right side of the torso of the central female. The print testifies to Blake's experimentation with a wide range of graphic processes throughout his career.</p><p>The attribution of the print to Blake is based on the printing technique, the anatomical and gestural parallels between the figures and those appearing in Blake's work beginning in the 1780s, and the similarities between the design and a small pencil drawing, datable to c. 1787-93, on Object 18 (Bentley page 18) of Blake's Notebook. The print's title was first proposed in 1972 because of the general similarities between the composition and traditional emblems of charity. The c. 1788 dating is conjectural; the print could have been produced a year earlier or later, but generally accords with Blake's imagery and graphic experiments in the replication of drawings in the late 1780s.

The Approach of Doom,spb,c. 1787-88,1787.A,esiii.1.1.sp.100.jpg,esiii.1,esiii,"<p><i>The Approach of Doom</i> is probably one of Blake's earliest experiments in relief and white-line etching and thus can be dated to c. 1787-88. The figures are delineated in black line; the background was first executed as a solid mass and then extensively hatched in white line. The frontispiece to <i>America a Prophecy</i> (1793) exemplifies Blake's later refinements of this mixed technique.</p><p>The design is based on a pen and wash drawing attributed to Blake's younger brother Robert, probably executed c. 1785 and now in the British Museum. The attribution of the original design to Blake's brother makes the work, in the strictest sense, a reproduction plate. It has, however, generally been grouped with Blake's original graphics because of his changes in the design, the artistic and personal intimacy between designer and etcher, and the importance of the graphic medium to Blake's development as a printmaker. Use of a strong acid and a thin acid resist appears to have resulted in some pitting of the copperplate, particularly evident in the area left of the figures devoid of white-line work. The only known impression appears to have been heavily inked in some areas and lightly inked in those places where a grainy, reticulated texture appears.</p><p>The design&mdash;a group of people huddled on the margin of the sea and fearful of some unseen presence to the left&mdash;is generally similar in setting and emotional expression to the frontispiece to <i>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</i> (1793) and in accord with Blake's sense of impending catastrophe for the old order. Two of his separate plates of the early 1790s, <i>The Accusers of Theft Adultery Murder</i> (1793) and <i>Lucifer and the Pope in Hell</i> (1794), engage the same basic theme.",esiii.info.xml,0,,0,  
Joseph of Arimathea Among the Rocks of Albion,spb,1773,1773.A,esi.1-1a.1.sp.100.jpg,"esi.1-1a,esi.2-2d",esi,"<p>As the inscribed date of ""1773"" on the second state of <i>Joseph of Arimathea Among the Rocks of Albion</i> indicates, Blake engraved his first separate plate at the age of fifteen or sixteen in only his second year of apprenticeship to the engraver James Basire. The print may have been a type of shop exercise intended as a demonstration of the young man's skills. The figure is based on the unidentified figure wearing a Phrygian cap and standing on the far right of <i>The Crucifixion of Saint Peter</i> painted by Michelangelo in the Pauline Chapel of the Vatican (1549). Blake could have known this figure through several engravings of the entire painting or the figure alone without background in the (unfinished?) engraving by Nicolas Beatrizet (c 1515-60). Both the original painting and Beatrizet's engraving picture the man with eyes closed, whereas they are clearly open in Blake's plate. As he indicates in his pen and ink inscription on the only known impression of the first state, Blake's immediate source was a ""drawing"" by ""Salviati""&mdash;either Francesco Rossi Salviati (1510-63) or his less famous student Gioseffo Porta (1535-85) who used the same name. Basire had visited Italy and may have acquired the ""Salviati"" drawing (or an engraving of it?) at that time. The background is probably Blake's own invention, but may have been influenced by the very similar seascape and rocky cliff in Joshua Reynolds' portrait of Commodore Keppel, painted in 1752.</p><p>Late in his career, c. 1820-25, Blake returned to some of his earlier separate plates to revise them both visually, through the addition of dramatic contrasts of darkness and illumination, and thematically through the addition of inscriptions. With his extensive revisions in the second state of <i>Joseph of Arimathea Among the Rocks of Albion</i>, Blake transformed a technically competent but dull and flat apprentice plate into an energetic work of art and a statement of some of his more important religious and aesthetic beliefs. For these reasons the print is included among Blake's original graphics rather than grouped with his reproductive works. The engraved inscriptions identify the figure as Joseph of Arimathea, Christ's disciple who, according to an old Somersetshire legend, brought Christianity to England. Blake further identifies Joseph as an apostle of Christian art: as he states in his <i>Laoco&ouml;n</i> inscriptions of c. 1826-27, ""Jesus &amp; his Apostles &amp; Disciples were all Artists"" (Erdman page 274). For Blake, Christian art was most fully embodied in the Gothic style. Thus Joseph, who according to the legend built a church at Glastonbury, can be further identified with the builders of Gothic cathedrals.",esi.info.xml,0,,0,
Blake's Notebook,ms,c. 1787-1818,1787.A,,bb122.1,bb122,"<p>What we now think of as Blake's Notebook was probably begun by his younger brother Robert for sketching and then preserved by William after Robert's early death in 1787.

Why William Palmer we don't know, but that route bypassed Frederick Tatham, who inherited what was left of William Blake in Catherine's hands at her death. In an outbreak of religious fervor that led Tatham to reject Blake's infernal heresies, he eventually burned a considerable stash, contents mostly unknown. Safe from the flames, the Notebook went eventually from Palmer to Dante Gabriel Rossetti at a propitious time before Blake was slated for dramatic revival through the efforts of Alexander Gilchrist, his wife Anne, and their helpful associates and informants, including the Rossetti brothers, Dante and William. They were careful to minimize Blake's objectional side as they shaped surviving materials. Dante Rossetti bound the Notebook with <a href=""http://www.rossettiarchive.org/docs/3-1862.blms.radheader.html"">his own heavily edited transcription</a> of ""All that is of any worth in the book.""</p><p>The underlying pattern is familiar.

Ellis and William Butler Yeats, in their lavish and extensive three-volume <i>Works of William Blake, Poetic, Symbolic, and Critical, Edited with [296] Lithographs of the Illustrated ""Prophetic Books,"" and a Memoir and Interpretation</i> (1893), to reach deeper into the well to retrieve stranger (and in most quarters less acceptable) writing and images as they constructed their unorthodox Blake with strong mystical inclinations.</p><p>Artists' notebooks are often dissected and analyzed, of course, as part of the deep background for the genesis and evolution of texts and images. Editors of twentieth century printed editions almost always sorted items from the Notebook into meaningful literary categories&mdash;""Satiric Verses and Epigrams,"" ""Songs and Ballads,"" ""Miscellaneous Prose""&mdash;leaving little trace of the book as a whole&mdash;and of course omitting images altogether. But Blake's Notebook, like its artistic kin, can and should also be considered as an integral work, in this case the work of a lifetime, unlike any other that he left us.</p><p>In <i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i> Blake imagines a Printing House in Hell whose apocalyptic output&mdash;created by dragons, vipers, eagle-like men, and lions of flaming fire&mdash;""took the forms of books & were arranged in libraries"" (plate 15, Erdman page 40), there to await suitably apocalyptic readers to open the pages and liberate the volatile content. Artists' notebooks, more than most books, declare their dynamic energies outright. Open the pages and you know instantly that you must participate.

"Illustrations to Edward Young's ""Night Thoughts""",wc,c. 1795-97,1795,but330.1.2.wc.100.jpg,but330.1,but330,"<p>Although there are no extant documentary records of the contract, it was probably in late 1794 or early 1795 that the publisher Richard Edwards commissioned Blake to illustrate a new, deluxe edition of Edward Young's long meditative poem, <i>The Complaint, and the Consolation; or, Night Thoughts</i>, first published in 1742-45 and generally known by the short title of <i>Night Thoughts</i>.  This was the largest commercial endeavor for which Blake was ever employed.  Edwards began the project by having the pages from the first and second editions of the poem glued into windows cut into large leaves of Whatman wove paper.  These text pages were positioned slightly off-center so as to create a lower margin greater than the upper and an outer margin greater than the inner, as in most letterpress books.  With what must have been enormous energy, Blake filled these large marginal spaces with 537 water color designs illustrating the poem's nine sections, which Young called ""Nights.""  Blake was paid the paltry sum of twenty guineas for his water colors, presumably because he expected to receive a great deal more for engraving them.</p><p>Most of the inset text pages contain at least two sets of inscribed marks in their left margins.  Many of the pen and ink marks and a few in pencil, mostly in the form of crosses, were partly trimmed off the text leaves or covered by the edges of the windows when they were mounted into the larger leaves containing Blake's water colors.  This trimming or covering clearly indicates that the pen and ink marks were inscribed prior to mounting and also suggests that Edwards or someone in his employ inscribed these marks as indications&mdash;or at least recommendations&mdash;of the lines of the poem to be illustrated.  The crosses and stars written in pencil were probably inscribed after the text leaves were mounted and may have been executed by Blake.  These pencil marks correspond in most instances to the line or lines of the poem illustrated.  Shortly after the designs were delivered to Edwards, he had all but two of them placed in stiff paper mats that in turn were bound into two folio volumes.  The mats are not included among our reproductions.  For further information about the inscribed marks and mats, see the Copy Information page and the Editors' Notes for each design.</p><p>Although all the water colors may not have been completed by the spring of 1796, Blake began at that time to etch and engrave a selection of forty-three designs illustrating the first four Nights.  These were published by Edwards in 1797 in the first of four intended large quarto volumes.  Two copies of this work are in the Archive, one uncolored and one with contemporary hand coloring.  Before any further volumes could be produced, Edwards closed his publishing business.  Blake's disappointment must have been profound.  The failure of the <i>Night Thoughts</i> project may have been one of the reasons why Blake decided, in 1800, to move from London to the village of Felpham on the Sussex coast and place himself under the patronage of William Hayley.</p><p>While Blake based his designs closely on the text, many of the images draw upon personifications or metaphors in the poem.  This approach tends to literalize what is only a figure of speech in the text, thereby confounding conventional distinctions between the literal and the metaphoric.  Further, Blake drew heavily on his own repertory of motifs and postures when illustrating Young, and thus there are many parallels between the <i>Night Thoughts</i> designs and the pictures in Blake's illuminated books.  The influence of the <i>Night Thoughts</i> project on Blake's writings is most directly evinced by his division of his long manuscript poem, <i>Vala</i> or <i>The Four Zoas</i> (Bentley 209), into nine Nights.  That manuscript also contains forty-seven pre-publication proofs of the <i>Night Thoughts</i> engravings, with lines of <i>The Four Zoas</i> written in the text panels.</p>",but330.info.xml,0,,0,
"VALA, or The Four Zoas",ms,c. 1796-1807,1796,bb209.1.1.ms.100.jpg,bb209.1,bb209,"<p>The messy, complex manuscript of nearly 150 pages that has slowly settled into Blake's oeuvre under its odd double name has resisted efforts to edit it satisfactorily in print, but for those who aim to grasp the full compass of Blake's artistic, social, and spiritual aspirations, the manuscript is indispensable. Northrop Frye wrote that ""There is nothing like the colossal explosion of creative power in the Ninth Night of <i>The Four Zoas</i> anywhere else in English poetry,"" while the work as a whole is ""the greatest abortive masterpiece in English literature"" (<i>Fearful Symmetry</i> page 305). Indeed, there is that&mdash;but there is also, as Frye recognized, the pivotal place of <i>VALA</i>, or <i>The Four Zoas</i> in Blake's creative life as writer and visual artist.</p><p>It may seem odd, then, that most of the nineteenth century managed to overlook it. In ""The System,"" volume 1 of Edwin John Ellis and William Butler Yeats' very ambitious three volumes of interpretation, paraphrase, selected lithographic reproductions, and edition of Blake's works published in 1893, they scolded their predecessors: ""But though whatever is accessible to us now was accessible to them when they wrote, including the then unpublished 'VALA,' not one chapter, not one clear paragraph about the myth of Four Zoas, is to be found in all that they have published"" (volume 1 page viii). They are pointing to Alexander Gilchrist and his collaborators, who had produced the landmark <i>Life of William Blake, ""Pictor Ignotus""</i> thirty years earlier in the first attempt to piece together the scattered bits of Blake's life: a birth-to-death narrative plus several supplements, including reproductions, extracts, and William Michael Rossetti's lists&mdash;the first of their kind&mdash;of a considerable range of Blake's life's work. Their aim had been to bring into focus a William Blake who, in the years since his death in 1827, had been inexorably dispersing into incoherent filaments that, without strong intervention, would have become irrecoverable. Gilchrist and company had been remarkably successful in assembling a multi-dimensional, concretely memorable representation of Blake.</p><p>Without it, in fact, Ellis and Yeats would never have been able to launch their own massive project three decades later. But they were right about the Four Zoas, which for them was both a central document, <i>VALA</i>, and the central idea in their elaborate interpretation of Blake. How had it come into being and then disappeared for so long?</p><p>In c. 1794-95 Blake secured a commission to produce engraved illustrations for a deluxe new edition of Edward Young's popular long poem, <i>The Complaint: or, Night-Thoughts on Life, Death, & Immortality</i>, structured as nine ""nights."" Blake worked very hard on this commercial project, the largest of his life, producing over 500 large preliminary watercolors and over 40 engravings for the first and only published volume (1797) before the four-volume project was discontinued.</p><p>Out of this intense and undoubtedly disappointing episode emerged one of Blake's most formidable creative efforts&mdash;a long narrative of nine ""nights,"" on paper and proofs of the <i>Night Thoughts</i> engravings left over from the Edwards venture. <i>VALA</i>, or <i>The Four Zoas</i> is epic and cosmic in scope, an attempt to explain the human situation&mdash;and to offer a vision of redemption based on a kind of corrected Christianity that requires a complex retelling of the mental, physical, and spiritual history of the world, one that, as Blake later put it, reads the Bible white where others read black&mdash;""a cyclic vision of life from the Fall to the Last Judgment . . . . in a single form the totality of what Blake came into the world to say"" (Frye page 269).</p><p>The illuminated books of the 1790s had been, in effect, installments in this eventual monomyth, and <i>VALA</i> seems to have become the artistic workshop in which the myth could be fully imagined. Having begun with confidence&mdash;part of the manuscript is clean fair copy in an elegant copperplate hand&mdash;Blake at some point began drafting and revising in several stages. Night the Ninth is titled ""The Last Judgment,"" which is about as finished as one can imagine, but there are two nights numbered seven, many indecisive revisions, sketches of various sorts, and other features that indicate an unfinished, ultimately abandoned project that had at least served to lay the foundations for Blake's largest illuminated books by far, <i>Milton a Poem</i> and <i>Jerusalem</i>, all narrated, like <i>The Four Zoas</i>, in unrhymed heroic fourteeners, the seven-stress line that Blake had begun mastering in the 1790s. The <i>Zoas</i> manuscript seems to have been put aside about 1807 after nearly a decade of off and on work, including the three years that Blake spent in Felpham.</p><p>Before he died, Blake gave the manuscript to his fellow artist, friend, and patron John Linnell, and it remained in the family until 1918. Ellis and Yeats borrowed it from Linnell's sons and went to work trying to sort out the scrambled pages and untangle the mass of revisions so that they could present, in their third volume, a selection of crude lithographic reproductions and a complete (though unreliable) printed edition, with notes, under the title <i>VALA</i>, cited many times in the two preceding volumes of commentary and paraphrase that attempt to build a structure of meaning centered on the myth of the Zoas. This is remarkable because, as they themselves said, this ""prophetic"" side of Blake's oeuvre had been discounted and timidly represented.</p><p>As a poet, Blake had been known almost entirely through the texts extracted from his <i>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</i>. This began to change with the publication of Gilchrist's <i>Life</i>, governed by contradictory impulses toward comprehensive coherence on the one hand and normalization on the other to produce a paradigm of the imaginative artist who was not, however, insane. Remarkably, until Ellis and Yeats published their edition in the final decade of the century, it was mentioned in print only twice, both times dismissively&mdash;first in William Michael Rossetti's list of works by Blake (Gilchrist 1863, volume 2, page [240]; second edition, 1880, volume 2, page 256) and again in the Prefatory Memoir to his Aldine edition (page cxxx). As Rossetti had put it, ""With the exception of this very extraordinary&mdash;. . . and very unreadable&mdash;series of works""&mdash;he means Blake's ""prophecies""&mdash;""our edition presents the whole body of Blake's poetry"" (page cxxx). That next bold move&mdash;taking the ""exception"" from periphery to center to radically realign ""the body of Blake's poetry""&mdash;required Ellis and Yeats, whose spiritual investments attracted them especially to those very works.</p>",bb209.info.xml,0,,0,
"Twelve Illustrations to ""Tiriel""",mono,c. 1789,1789,but198.1.1.wd.100.jpg,but198.1,but198,"<p>Blake produced a dozen highly finished monochrome wash drawings to illustrate his poem <i>Tiriel</i>.  Like the manuscript of the poem, the drawings are usually dated to c. 1789.  Three drawings have been untraced since 1863: <i>Har, Heva and Mnetha</i>, <i>Har and Heva Playing Harps</i>, and <i>The Death of Tiriel's Sons</i>  (Butlin 198.3, 5, 9).  One extant drawing, <i>Hela Contemplating Tiriel Dead in a Vineyard</i> (Butlin 198.12), is in a private collection from which we have not been able to obtain a digital image suitable for presentation in the Archive.</p><p>The character of the drawings indicates that they are preliminaries for intaglio etchings/engravings.  Blake's medium of relief etching, used in most of his illuminated books beginning c. 1788, did not require the preparation of finished preliminary drawings.  He probably intended these illustrations to be interleaved with the text of <i>Tiriel</i> printed from etched and engraved plates or in letterpress.  Such a book, if engraved, would be similar to what Blake described, with a rich use of hyperbole, in his manuscript of <i>An Island in the Moon</i> (c. 1784-85):  "". . . I would have all the writing Engraved instead of Printed & at every other leaf a high finishd print all in three Volumes folio, & sell them a hundred pounds a piece"" (Erdman page 465).  If printed in letterpress, the book would be similar to conventional publications, such as Joseph Ritson's <i>Select Collection of English Songs</i> (1783), for which Blake was regularly employed to engrave the illustrations.</p><p>Stylistically, the <i>Tiriel</i> drawings follow the neoclassical idiom of their time.  Several wash drawings of the 1780s by Blake's friend John Flaxman, such as <i>A Procession of Early British Saints</i> in the Fitzwilliam Museum, are similar in style, use of landscape backgrounds, and emotional expression.  Objects 2 and 8, <i>Har and Heva Bathing</i>, <i>Mnetha Looking On</i> and <i>Har and Heva Asleep with Mnetha Guarding Them</i>, are more loosely executed than their companions and portray larger figures that fill more of the pictorial space.  They may have been slightly later additions to the series.</p><p>Some scholars have dated both the manuscript and the drawings at least two years earlier than 1789&mdash;that is, before Blake's invention and use of relief etching for the publication of his writings.  For an argument in favor of an earlier date, see David Bindman, <i>Blake as an Artist</i> (Oxford: Phaidon, 1977) 43-44.  The pencil <i>Sketch for ""Tiriel Denouncing His Sons and Daughters""</i> is described by Butlin 199 as a preliminary for that wash drawing, object 6, but may be of a later date.  The standing figures on the right in the pencil sketch are close to those in Blake's etching/engraving of 1793, ""Our End is come"" (later state titled ""The Accusers of Theft Adultery Murder"").  Thus, the sketch may be a transitional work between the <i>Tiriel</i> illustration and the separate plate.</p>",but198.info.xml,0,,0,
Poetical Sketches,te,c. 1769-77,1769,,bb128.c,bb128,"<p>Blake's experiences in the London social circle of the Rev. A. S. Mathew and his wife Harriet in the 1780s gave him both inspiration and opportunities. <i>An Island in the Moon</i>, a manuscript fragment that includes poems and songs in wacky satirical contexts, is an early vehicle for his impressions of the Mathew circle. <i>Poetical Sketches</i> is a more serious, in some respects major, literary experiment that grew out of the accumulated earlier efforts of this multi-talented engraver's apprentice to write poems and poetic prose sketches some of which he later probably recited and sang in company. The Mathews must have been impressed, because they joined with the artist and sculptor John Flaxman to subsidize the printing, in 1783, of Blake's first and only typographical collection of poetry. (For what is known about the printing, see the note under Publisher on the Copy Information page.) It was a rudimentary printing job rather than a formally published volume: perhaps fifty copies of eleven sheets that could be folded and assembled into small volumes with a title page presenting ""W. B."" as author followed by a one page, unsigned ""Advertisement"" for these displays of ""poetic originality, which merited some respite from oblivion"" (Object 2). The uncorrected sheets were apparently left in Blake's hands to do with as he saw fit, which, surprisingly, was nothing more than to present individual volumes to friends and patrons now and then throughout his life. He (and others) variously corrected and emended some copies but left others untouched. Only about half-at the latest count twenty-four-survive.</p><p>Despite its somewhat unpromising origins, <i>Poetical Sketches</i> remains vitally important in its revelations of Blake's reading habits and early accomplishments-several fine poems, including the often anthologized ""I Lov'd the Jocund Dance"" and ""How Sweet I Roam'd from Field to Field""-along with strong anticipations of his developing styles and interests. The collection materializes at a productive literary intersection of Elizabethan and neoclassical poetics, biblical allusion, late eighteenth-century innovations, emergent Romantic modes, and idiosyncratic mythopoeic genius. A Shakespearean invocation to the muse begins ""King Edward the Third,"" while it, along with ""Edward IV"" and ""King John,"" sets a tone similar to Shakespeare's history plays. The stimulus of popular eighteenth-century poems-James Thomson's <i>The Seasons</i> (finished in 1730), Edward Young's <i>Night Thoughts</i>, and James Macpherson's pseudo-medieval <i>Ossian poems</i>-can be felt. And, of course, Blake's key predecessor John Milton leaves his mark, particularly in ""Contemplation"" and ""Samson.""</p><p>Although the earliest works may have been drafted when Blake was an ""untutored youth"" (Advertisement, Object 2), the collection conveys a powerful sense of the original author he was fast becoming. His visionary or prophetic mode (""Gwin, King of Norway""), his underlying social and political commitments (in the ironic ""King Edward the Third""), and his easy assimilation of new literary trends (the gothic ""Fair Elinor"") are all evident. As miscellaneous as it is, <i>Poetical Sketches</i> anticipates the major literary work soon to come.</p>",bb128.info.xml,0,,0,
Pencil Sketches,penc,1779-1790,1779,pencil1.jpg,,pencil1,"<p>Drawing lies at the core of Blake's life as an artist. Pencil was his preferred medium for sketching&mdash;more flexible, less expensive, and more easily corrected than pen and ink or chalk. Preliminary work with the pencil preceded more finished work, either as separate sketches for prints and paintings or as drawings underlying water colors. Blake's nineteenth-century writings on the arts testify to his conviction that drawing was fundamental to all pictorial expression:<blockquote><p>The distinction that is made in modern times between a Painting and a Drawing proceeds from ignorance of art. The merit of a Picture is the same as the merit of a Drawing. (<i>A Descriptive Catalogue</i>, Erdman page 549)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Let a Man who has made a Drawing go on & on & he will produce a Picture or Painting but if he chooses to leave off before he has spoild it he will Do a Better Thing[.] (<i>Public Address</i>, Erdman page 576)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Painting is Drawing on Canvas & Engraving is Drawing on Copper & Nothing Else...& he who Draws best must be the best Artist.... (<i>Public Address</i>, Erdman page 582)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Dear Sir, excuse my enthusiasm or rather madness, for I am really drunk with intellectual vision whenever I take a pencil or graver into my hand.... (letter to William Hayley, 1804, Erdman page 757)</p></blockquote> Blake no doubt executed a great many more pencil drawings than those extant today. Sketches were not intended for exhibition or sale; most were probably discarded, while others may have been retained only because of more developed compositions on the other side of the leaves. Even the slightest and least aesthetically ambitious drawings offer insights into the origins and earliest realizations of Blake's designs. These first thoughts on paper often tell us more about Blake's habits of mind, when joined by eye and hand, than more finished works. Sketches are ""the first fruits of [Blake's] imagination,"" as Geoffrey Keynes states in the introduction to his <i>Pencil Drawings of William Blake</i> (1927).</p><p>The forty-three pencil drawings presented here, produced in Blake's first decade as an independent artist, show his early debt to academic standards of precise copying and to the neoclassical emphasis on outline. The first four works may have been drawn while Blake was a student in the Royal Academy schools. Other sketches are preliminaries for some of Blake's most important designs. Among these are the <i>Study for ""Glad Day"", or ""Albion Rose""</i> ( Object 6), Blake's iconic vision of the human form divine in energetic pose, and three sketches (Objects 34-36) for illustrations to <i>Tiriel</i>, the only group of finished drawings Blake composed for one of his own poems. Several sketches are early efforts at picturing events in the Bible, Blake's main inspiration for designs throughout his life.  This biblical cluster includes <i>The Resurrection of the Dead</i> (Object 10), <i>Samuel Presenting Saul to the People</i> (Object 15), and <i>Job's Wife and Other Sketches</i> (Object 31). Other studies, such as <i>Ugolino in Prison</i> and its verso (Objects 21-22), reveal the beginnings of subjects also of lifelong interest for Blake. Only a few drawings for Blake's illuminated books have survived, but studies such as <i>Sketches for ""The Book of Thel""</i> and <i>A Standing and a Recumbent Figure</i> (Objects 37-39) offer fascinating glimpses into Blake's methods of graphic production and revision.</p>",pencil1.info.xml,1,"but71.1,but72r.1,but72v.1,but115v.1,but178v.1,but73r.1,but73v.1,but78r.1,but78v.1,but79r.1,but80r.1,but80v.1,but82v.1,but83.1,but117.1,but123v.1,but127v.1,but133v.1,but148v.1,but154v.1,but207r.1,but207v.1,but223v.1,butwba8.1,but76v.1,but77v.1,but81r.1,but81v.1,but87v.1,but154r.1,but162v.1,butwba3.1,but172.1,but199r.1,but200r.1,but200v.1,but218r.1,but218v.1,but219.1,but235r.1,but235v.1,but88v.1,but220.1",0,
Pen and Ink Drawings,penink,1774-c. 1825,1774,pid.jpg,,pid,"<p>This group of pen and ink drawings, ranging chronologically from Blake's apprenticeship as an engraver to the final decade of his life, offers a comprehensive overview of his work in the medium.  Most were created when Blake was learning his craft as an artist and reveal his exploration of various themes and genres. His apprentice drawings for James Basire (<i>The Body of Edward I</i> and <i>Countess Aveline</i>) show his early engagement with medieval art. Another group (two drawings titled <i>Figures from a Greek Vase</i> and <i>Charon</i>) is clearly based on classical art or mythology, responses to which were central to British art and design in the second half of the eighteenth century. The cluster of related sketches on two leaves, each titled <i>Four Composition Sketches</i>, is the earliest extant example of Blake's attempt to construct a pictorial narrative through a series of images. In these, he began to develop his own version of the sublime, an aesthetic more fully represented by the texts and designs in the illuminated books of the 1790s. Several works from the 1780s show the influence of neoclassicism and take their subjects from two fields of lasting interest to Blake: British history (<i>King Alfred</i>, <i>A Woman Enthroned</i>, and <i>Procession of Monks</i>) and the Bible (<i>Saul and David</i>, <i>Goliath Cursing David</i>, and two versions of <i>The Good Farmer</i>). The three much later drawings are exceptions to Blake's customary procedures and subjects: a landscape <i>Garden Path</i>, <i>The Prophet Isaiah</i> drawn on a woodblock for a wood engraving never executed, and <i>Lady Torrens</i>, a copy of a family portrait by his friend and patron John Linnell.</p><p>Blake did not execute a large number of pen and ink drawings. This is a bit surprising, given the compatibility between the linearity of the medium and his insistence on ""the distinct, sharp, and wirey ... bounding line"" as the ""great and golden rule of art"" (Blake's <i>Descriptive Catalogue</i>, Erdman page 550). He did, however, make extensive use of pen and ink work to outline forms in his water colors, color prints, and hand tinted relief etchings in the illuminated books. For preliminary sketching, Blake favored pencil over pen and ink, probably because of the lower cost of pencil and the ease of erasure and correction it offered.</p>",pid.info.xml,1,"but1.1,but6.1,but99.1,but100.1,btu94.1,but174.1,but175.1,but178r.1,but118r.1,but119Ar.1,but120r.1,but122v.1,but85v.1,but86v.1,but370.1,but773.1,but801.1",0,
Water Color Drawings Illustrating the Bible,wc,c. 1780-1824,1780,biblicalwc.jpg,,biblicalwc,"<p>The Bible had an enormous influence on Blake's work as both artist and poet.  Among his many and complex responses to that text are water color drawings.  These range throughout most of Blake's career, beginning with early works such as <i>Abraham and Isaac</i>, datable to c. 1780, and continuing to <i>Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</i> of c. 1824.  The main group of biblical water colors is a sequence of about 80 works of similar size painted for Thomas Butts between c. 1800 and c. 1806.  The Old Testament subjects emphasize interactions, both revelatory and punishing, between the human and the divine.  New Testament subjects naturally center on the life of Christ.  Most of the works based on books following the four Gospels, such as <i>The Conversion of Saul</i>, picture moments of revelation.  The water colors painted for Butts include some of Blake's greatest works in that medium, including <i>The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed with the Sun</i> and at least seven other examples of the apocalyptic sublime based on the Book of Revelation.</p><p>  The water colors are arranged here according to the order in Martin Butlin's <i>The Paintings and Drawings of William Blake</i>, a catalogue raisonn&eacute; and standard reference work on Blake.  At some point after 1846, many of the water colors painted for Butts were mounted on backing mats inscribed in handsome script with appropriate passages from the Bible.

The use of dialogue interspersed with song lyrics links <i>An Island in the Moon</i> to both   contemporary theatrical forms and broader eighteenth-century traditions of satirical narrative.

Blake, writing in his mid to late 20s, demonstrates a born satirist's instincts for the ridiculous. Though satire is never entirely absent from the illuminated books, only in <i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i> (1790) is it the dominant mode. <i>An Island in the Moon</i> underscores the importance of the extensive stretches of humor and satire that show up frequently among his other writings. So, although Blake left it orphaned, untitled, and   unfinished in a heavily revised manuscript, <i>Island</i> is in some sense a primary literary experiment for him, setting the undertone of much to follow.</p><p><i>Island</i> is an incomplete manuscript written in pen and ink in Blake's hand. It notably contains the earliest extant drafts of ""Nurse's Song,"" ""HOLY THURSDAY,"" and ""The Little Boy Lost,"" which make their first published appearance in his <i>Songs of Innocence</i> (1789). The   history of Blake's associations with the Mathew circle, along with topical allusions to balloon hats&mdash;a short-lived fashion associated with early demonstrations of ballooning&mdash;and the performing monkey General Jacko, suggest a period of composition c. 1784-85. Before the manuscript was   given to the Fitzwilliam Museum in 1905, two or more leaves may have been removed, stranding the passage ("". . . them Illuminating the Manuscript . . ."") that begins abruptly on <a href=""&#xA;            /copy/bb74.1?descId=bb74.1.ms.17"">Object 17</a>. The contents of a final page of lettering   and rough sketches (<a href=""&#xA;            /copy/bb74.1?descId=bb74.1.ms.18"">Object 18</a>) seem unrelated to   the text of <i>Island</i>. The sketches and lettering on the verso of Object 18 may reflect   Robert Blake's attempts to draw subjects that had been set as exercises for him by older brother William, and, in some instances, corrected by one of them (see the Object Note under Editors' Notes for Object 18).

Some years later, probably in 1818 or later, Blake returned to these impressions and drew between four and six framing lines in black ink around each plate.

Most of the drawings are more or less clearly related to passages in the manuscript.  Originally, Blake may have planned to engrave the writing and the illustrations or a selection of them and assemble the two in a set sequence&mdash;with or without a publisher.  Alternatively, he may have envisioned a typographic work with engraved illustrations. But he never saw the project through to completion, and the materials are now dispersed.</p><p><i>Tiriel</i> is a harshly ironic family tragedy with strong, suggestive, but elusive mythical and allegorical overtones reinforced by Blake's first use of the verse paragraphs and heroic fourteeners&mdash;fourteen-syllable lines with six or seven stresses&mdash;that he would employ for the roughly contemporary <i>Book of Thel</i> (1789) and other illuminated works: ""Over the weary hills the blind man took his lonely way"" until at last ""He ceast outstretchd at Har & Hevas feet in awful death"" (object 8, line 2, and object 16, line 7).</p><p>The eight-part narrative, though obscure in meaning, is simple in outline.

Human, natural, and divine states of being have yet to be separated. The child is the chief representative of this condition; other recurrent figures, such as the shepherd and lamb, point ultimately to the figure of Christ as the incarnation of the unity of innocence. In a few poems, the rhetoric, irony, and divided consciousness of experience begin to insinuate themselves into the landscape of innocence.

On the final plate, Thel comes to her grave and hears her own unanswered questions redolent with fears of both death and sexuality.

The French Revolution,te,1791,1791,,bb49.a,bb49,"<p><i>The French Revolution</i> (1791) is the only one of Blake's works of poetry ever slated for conventional publication&mdash;and by England's most prominent publisher of reformers and radicals, Joseph Johnson, whose authors included, among others, Erasmus Darwin, Mary Wollstonecraft, William Godwin, Joseph Priestley, and Thomas Malthus. But Blake's poem falls into a sadly familiar pattern in his artistic life: promises made, projects curtailed or cancelled, hopes dashed. <i>The French Revolution, A Poem. In Seven Books. Book the First</i> is followed by an optimistic ""Advertisement / The remaining Books of this Poem are finished and will be published in their Order."" If books 2-7 did exist, they never progressed beyond a manuscript now lost, any more than the great illuminated book <i>Milton / a Poem in [1]2 Books</i> ever got beyond its first two.</p><p>Only one copy of <i>The French Revolution</i> exists, apparently page proofs (set in type and arranged in pages for final stages of proofreading before publication). Blake's name does not appear. ""Wm Blake"" is inserted in an unknown hand in the customary space for authors' names. The original anonymity was perhaps an error but more likely a consequence of the same reticence to be identified with overtly radical sentiments that Blake showed on other occasions&mdash;in 1790, <i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i> (closing with the chorus of ""A Song of Liberty""), is the only illuminated book neither signed nor dated. If <i>The French Revolution</i> was withdrawn from publication, why? Johnson withdrew Thomas Paine's <i>Rights of Man</i> the same year; perhaps he abandoned Blake's poem for similar reasons. Concern would not have been entirely misplaced: in 1799 Johnson spent six months in prison for seditious libel.</p><p>Blake eventually gave, or sold, the page proofs of <i>The French Revolution Book the First</i> to his friend and patron John Linnell. A posthumous excerpt almost made it into W. M. Rossetti's selections from Blake's work for the 1880 edition of Gilchrist's <i>Life of Blake</i>&mdash;but not quite. Not until 1913 was Blake's poem finally published, in the second edition of John Sampson's <i>Poetical Works of William Blake</i>, well over a century after its original retraction.</p><p>Its date and subject mark <i>The French Revolution</i> as an attempted poetic contribution to the fierce Revolution Controversy, associated especially with Richard Price's sermon and pamphlet, ""Discourse on the Love of Our Country"" (1789), Edmund Burke's widely read <i>Reflections on the Revolution in France</i> (1790), Mary Wollstonecraft's <i>Vindication of the Rights of Men</i> (1790), and Paine's <i>Rights of Man</i> (1791, also printed for Johnson but published by someone less cautious).</p><p>In his edition, Erdman places <i>The French Revolution</i> in the category of Prophetic Works, Unengraved. ""Prophetic"" puts it where it belongs, with early works such as <i>Tiriel</i> (1789), <i>The Book of Thel</i> (1789), and <i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i> (1790)&mdash;all experiments in mythmaking whose tone and meaning can be so elusive. <i>The French Revolution</i> is the most explicitly historical of the early group&mdash;with characters (Fayette, the King), settings (the Bastille, Versailles), and plot elements transplanted from the daily news into mythic narrative that portends apocalyptic change:</p><blockquote>Sick, sick: the Prince on his couch, wreath'd in dim<br/>And appalling mist; . . . from his shoulder down the bone<br/>Runs aching cold into the scepter too heavy for mortal grasp . . . . <br/>. . . Rise, Necker: the ancient dawn calls us<br/>To awake from slumbers of five thousand years<br/>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(Erdman page 286)</blockquote><p>Historically, the plot compresses the earliest stage of the revolution&mdash;May to July 1789&mdash;into a single hypercharged sequence, from dawn to dawn, with suggestions of psychomachia, a psychological struggle against a radical change of mind. For his mode of telling, Blake searches again&mdash;as he had in <i>Tiriel</i> and <i>Thel</i>&mdash;for a poetic line capable of containing such volatile elements. The meter of <i>The French Revolution</i> has been characterized as ""a consistently anapestic roll"" (Frye, <i>Fearful Symmetry</i> page 185) and ""anapestic-iambic septenary"" (Damon, <i>Blake Dictionary</i> page 146), but it may be more helpful to hear it in the broad context of experiments in the long heroic line that start with <i>Tiriel</i> and <i>Thel</i> and culminate in the encyclopedic mythopoeia of <i>The Four Zoas</i>, <i>Milton</i>, and <i>Jerusalem</i>.</p>",bb49.info.xml,0,,0,

To the Public: Prospectus,illbk,1793,1793.E,bb206.1.illbk.1.100.jpg,bb206.1,bb206,"<p><i>To the Public</i>, dated ""October 10, 1793,"" first came to light in Gilchrist's <i>Life of Blake</i>, 1863, where it was introduced with a brief heading that described ""a characteristic Prospectus issued by Blake."" It had been transcribed from an ""original . . . in engraved writing printed in blue on a single leaf about 11 x 7 1/2 inches . . . obtained only at the last moment"" from a ""Mr. Frost""&mdash;perhaps William Edward Frost, a painter, member of the Royal Academy, and sometime collector of engravings by Blake's friend Thomas Stothard (Bentley, <i>Blake Books Supplement</i> page 142). Like several of Blake's letters, then, his 1793 prospectus is known only from the transcription of unknowable accuracy from Gilchrist's biography. </p> <p> Blake was 35 when he published his prospectus. He and his wife were living in Lambeth, a suburb on the south side of the Thames, in a combination of living quarters, workshop, and retail shop. In one respect the prospectus is just a one-page advertisement for a youngish engraver trying to draw attention to his wares, with an opening pitch followed by a list of works and prices, phrased in the conventionally boastful, class-conscious advertising diction of its day: ""Mr. Blake's powers of invention very early engaged the attention of many persons of eminence and fortune; by whose means he has been regularly enabled to bring before the Public works (he is not afraid to say) of equal magnitude and consequence with the productions of any age or country."" </p> <p> In other ways the prospectus punches, as they say, far above its weight. Its opening paragraph makes the startling claim that this engraver has solved the age-old problem of ""the Artist, the Poet, the Musician, [who] have been proverbially attended by poverty and obscurity."" He pinpoints their fundamental dilemma, the inability to reach ""the Public"" across commercial barriers. Middlemen&mdash;publishers, printers, shop owners in control of the means of production and distribution&mdash;have been able to block the free expression of artists ""owing to a neglect of means to propagate such works as have wholly absorbed the Man of Genius."" This 35-year-old engraver is not thinking of himself as a mere copyist but as an artist who belonged in the company of Britain's greatest painters and poets: ""Even Milton and Shakespeare could not publish their own works."" </p> <p> In his opening paragraph Blake implicitly bills himself as an amalgam of Prince and Elon Musk, a great artist who has discovered a technology that can set others free. He is an entrepreneur offering a method with the potential to liberate the artist and the audience, previously thwarted through no fault of their own (""never the fault of the Public""), to commune freely and openly for the first time. This is to be accomplished by a revolutionary ""method of Printing both Letter-press""&mdash;that is, texts&mdash;and ""Engraving""&mdash;that is, pictures&mdash;""in a style"" both grander and cheaper than heretofore possible. Blake implicitly claims that his invention would allow writers and artists to create and publish their works even if they were not trained engravers or letterpress printers. And, for several of his own works, Blake uses the language that has seemed to his posterity best fitted to label the products of his new technology: ""Illuminated Books"" in ""Illuminated Printing""&mdash;phrases he never uses again. </p> <p> Like so many visionary startups that promise to disrupt the status quo and replace it with liberating new technology, Blake's was a failure. It did not spread to the artistic community as he imagines it might, by introducing learnable handmade elements in a composite medium capable of delivering, in any combination, anything that could be written or drawn and thus displace a prevailing system that had led the audience to expect, as the norm, mechanical regularity in specialized media. </p> <p> Even his own use of his autographic medium probably played a large part in severely limiting his audience during his lifetime. Only decades later did mid-Victorian sponsors identify the problem and begin to separate Blake's words from his pictures and foster the production of conventional editions of poetry that could be printed, published, and sold alongside Milton, Shakespeare, Tennyson, and Browning. With that radical move, ""the Public"" that Blake never blamed for his failures began slowly to convene and expand into the worldwide audience that we take for granted today. In a late reversal of fortune, that appreciative audience has found in the original composite form of ""Illuminated Printing"" Blake's most tantalizing body of artistic work. </p>",bb206.info.xml,0,,0,

The Large Color Printed Drawings,cprint,1795,1795,cpd.jpg,,cpd,"<p>Blake's twelve large color prints, first designed and executed in 1795, are often considered to be his greatest works as a pictorial artist. Both their sublime imagery and the printmaking technique Blake used to create them evolved out of his illuminated books of 1790-95. Although at least one of the prints, <i>God Judging Adam</i>, shows evidence of having been printed from a copperplate etched in relief, the other eleven appear to have been painted within pen and ink outlines on gessoed millboards (a thick cardboard) and printed onto large sheets of damp wove paper using a rolling press. From such a prepared matrix Blake was often able to print two impressions (a first and second pull) without repainting the matrix, and he finished all impressions in water colors and pen and ink. No more than three impressions of any one of the twelve designs printed from the same matrix are extant. After printing, each impression was worked up with pen and ink outlining and water colors. For a full technical description of Blake's large color prints and their relation to the illuminated books and <i>Book of Designs</i>, see Joseph Viscomi, <i>William Blake's Printed Paintings</i> (New Haven and London: Paul Mellon Centre, 2021).</p><p>An impression of <i>Elohim Creating Adam</i> (Butlin 290) and an impression of <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> (Butlin 304) may be untraced. There are thirty extant impressions of twelve designs, all produced in at least two printings, c. 1795 and c. 1804-05. It is possible that, c. 1805, Blake added more hand outlining and tinting to some impressions printed in 1795. No design has more than three extant impressions. As with the illuminated books, each impression is different due to variations in color printing and finishing.</p><p>Modern scholars have interpreted the connections among the designs and their iconography, but no interpretation has become definitive. It seems as though the twelve subjects are not a series with a fixed sequence, but rather a group of designs centered upon images of the fallen world. Within that group are a few companion prints, such as <i>Elohim Creating Adam</i> and <i>Satan Exulting over Eve</i>, associated in subject, design, or both. The textual sources for the images range from the Bible to Shakespeare and Milton.</p><p>The large color prints are widely dispersed. The Archive contains all thirty extant impressions of the twelve designs.

Thirteen of the numbered plates and the title-page vignette are signed by Blake; a further three unsigned plates (7, 12, and 14) have been attributed to Blake by modern scholars.  As both title pages indicate, the full-page plates are based on drawings by Stedman.  None of the drawings on which Blake based his engravings has been traced, but it is likely that Blake made various minor alterations in Stedman's amateur designs.</p><p>Blake began work on the Stedman plates in 1791.  Stedman visited Blake in June 1794 and subsequently the engraver helped the author with various business matters, very probably including negotiations with the book's publisher, Joseph Johnson.  Blake's attitudes towards slavery and colonialism were indebted to Stedman's autobiographical narrative, as is particularly evident in the texts and designs of his illuminated books <i>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</i> and <i>America</i>, both dated 1793.  Stedman's relationship with a female slave, Joanna, may have influenced Blake's complex representations of gender and sexuality.</p><p>Most, possibly all, of the large-paper copies issued in 1796 have hand-colored plates that include touches of gold and silver.

These impressions of the designs only from Blake's illuminated books were richly color printed, very probably in 1796, the date Blake wrote on an impression of <i>The First Book of Urizen</i> Plate 1 in Copy B of <i>A Small Book of Designs</i>. Copy A, now in the British Museum, was prepared for Humphry and passed from his collection to his son, William Upcott. Blake or his wife Catherine gathered the 23 impressions with string through three holes, the method they used in his illuminated books, but he did not number them; they may not constitute a sequential series but simply a gathering of beautifully color printed designs.</p><p>When preparing the set of prints for Humphry in 1796, Blake apparently pulled a second impression of each plate (or at least of most of them) to build up his own stock of works. These impressions, now widely dispersed and eight not discovered until 2007, constitute most of Copy B of <i>A Small Book of Designs</i>. The thinner color printing in the Copy B impressions indicates that they are second pulls with little if any addition of color to the copperplates between pulls. Like those in Copy A, these impressions were stabbed through three holes. Many years later, probably c. 1818 or later, Blake added pen and ink framing lines around the prints (similar to those in <i>Songs</i> Copies R and V, both in the Archive), inscribed most of them with verse captions, and numbered them, apparently to indicate their order in a series. Blake had at least 22 numbered and framed impressions at one time, although subsequent treatment (or mistreatment) led to the erasure of some of the numbers and the trimming of the framing lines and captions.</p><p>Shared stab holes indicate that Copy B was at one time bound, probably by Blake or his wife Catherine. Three plates in Copy B&mdash;<i>The First Book of Urizen</i> Plates 9, 12, and 22&mdash;are not present in Copy A. These three impressions were probably not pulled during the 1796 printing of Copy A but were printed as part of Blake's production of color printed copies of <i>Urizen</i> in 1794. They are all full-page designs without text and thus could be incorporated into a group specifically printed without texts.</p><p>In his 1818 letter to Turner, Blake explains, with a note of regret, that the color prints for Humphry were created ""with the Loss of some of the best things For they when Printed perfect accompany Poetical Personifications &amp; Acts without which Poems they never could have been Executed"" (Erdman page 771). Although the impressions in <i>A Small Book of Designs</i> are some of Blake's finest works as a color printer, their separation from the texts of the illuminated books sacrifices the interplay between words and images. Blake's attitude toward the Book of Designs when he produced them may have differed from his much later statements to Turner.  Perhaps the verses he added to Copy B at about the same time he was writing to Turner were attempts to compensate for that loss.</p>",bb136.info.xml,0,,0,
"Edward Young, Night Thoughts",comb,1797,1797,bb515.1.1.com.100.jpg,"bb515.1,bb515.2",bb515,"<p>Although there are no extant documentary records of the contract, it was probably in late 1794 or early 1795 that the publisher Richard Edwards commissioned Blake to illustrate a new, deluxe edition of Edward Young's long meditative poem, <i>The Complaint, and the Consolation; or, Night Thoughts</i>, first published in 1742-45 and generally known by the short title of <i>Night Thoughts</i>.  This was the largest commercial project for which Blake was ever employed.  With what must have been enormous energy, he executed 537 water colors (Butlin 330.1-537) illustrating the poem's nine sections, which Young called ""Nights.""  Edwards began the project by having the pages from the first and second editions of the poem glued into windows cut into large leaves of Whatman wove paper. These text pages were positioned slightly off-center so as to create a lower margin greater than the upper and an outer margin greater than the inner, as in most letterpress books.  Blake filled these large marginal spaces with his designs&mdash;a format retained in the published engravings with the letterpress text of the poem printed in a central framed panel.  Blake was paid the paltry sum of twenty guineas for his water colors, presumably because he expected to receive a great deal more for the engravings.</p><p>Although all the water colors may not have been completed by the spring of 1796, Blake began at that time to etch and engrave a selection of forty-three designs illustrating the first four Nights.  These were published in 1797 as the first of four intended large quarto volumes.  The registration of the plates to the sheets of paper, which were barely large enough to accommodate the engravings, was frequently poor, with the result that even untrimmed copies of the book are missing small marginal areas of some of the designs and/or the imprints and Blake's monogram signatures in the lower margins.  Before any further volumes could be produced, Edwards closed his publishing business.  Blake's disappointment must have been profound.  The failure of the <i>Night Thoughts</i> project may have been one of the reasons why Blake decided, in 1800, to move from London to the village of Felpham on the Sussex coast and place himself under the patronage of William Hayley.</p><p>Most of the water colors bear a cross or star to the left of the line (or first line of the passage) illustrated.  This procedure was continued, somewhat irregularly, through the use of asterisks in the published volume.  In some cases, the line preceded by an asterisk in the engravings is not the same as in the corresponding water colors.  Many copies of the 1797 volume contain a two-page ""Explanation of the Engravings,"" possibly written by Blake's friend and fellow-artist Henry Fuseli.  The texts of these commentaries are included in the Editors' Notes for each plate.</p><p>While Blake based his designs closely on the text, many of the images are based on personifications or metaphors in the poem.  This approach tends to literalize what is only a figure of speech in the text, thereby confounding conventional distinctions between the literal and the metaphoric.  Further, Blake drew heavily on his own repertory of motifs and postures when illustrating Young, and thus there are many parallels between the <i>Night Thoughts</i> designs and the pictures in Blake's illuminated books.  The influence of the <i>Night Thoughts</i> project on Blake's writings is most directly evinced by his division of his long manuscript poem, <i>Vala</i> or <i>The Four Zoas</i> (Bentley 209), into nine Nights.  That manuscript also contains forty-seven pre-publication proofs of the <i>Night Thoughts</i> engravings, with lines of <i>The Four Zoas</i> written in the text panels.  A further group of twenty-four proofs is now in the Houghton Library, Harvard University.</p><p>Copy 1 presented here is uncolored; Copy 2 is one of at least twenty-eight copies with contemporary or near-contemporary hand coloring.  The colorist or colorists have never been convincingly identified.  The same palette appears to have been used for most copies, but the placement of the colors varies somewhat among copies.  Such variation is not characteristic of the commercial hand coloring of the late eighteenth century in which a model is followed very closely.  Some scholars have divided the colored copies into two styles, one dated to c. 1797 and the other to c. 1805.  There are, however, colors common to the palettes of these two styles.  Two copies (Yale Center for British Art and Houghton Library, Harvard University) bear early inscriptions attributing their coloring to Blake; a copy in the Library of Congress has a pencil inscription attributing its coloring to Blake's wife Catherine.  Six copies bear J C (or possibly H) monograms that would seem to relate to their coloring.</p>",bb515.info.xml,0,,0,
Illustrations to Gray's Poems,wc,c. 1797-98,1797,but335.1.1.wc.100.jpg,but335.1,but335,"<p>The 116 water-color illustrations to Thomas Gray's poems are among Blake's major achievements as an illustrator. They were commissioned in 1797 by Blake's friend, the sculptor John Flaxman, as a gift for his wife Ann, to whom Blake addressed the poem that ends the series. The commission may have been inspired by the Flaxmans' seeing Blake's water-color designs to Edward Young's <i>Night Thoughts</i>, begun in 1795. The Gray illustrations follow the same basic format. Blake cut windows in large sheets of the same type of Whatman paper used for the <i>Night Thoughts</i> illustrations and mounted in these windows the texts of Gray's poems from a 1790 octavo edition published by John Murray, leaving out some prefatory materials, fly-titles, the notes, and the 7 engraved illustrations. Blake then drew and colored his designs surrounding the letterpress texts. On blank versos near the beginning of each poem, and in one case on a separate piece of paper pasted over letterpress text, Blake inscribed with pen and ink either titles for each design or quotations from the poem to indicate the passage illustrated. On most text pages, Blake also drew a pencil cross left of the first line of the illustrated passage. He numbered most leaves consecutively in pen and ink, beginning a new sequence for each of the 13 poems.</p><p>Blake conceived of his work as an illustrated book, rather than a series of unbound designs, as indicated by his offsetting Gray's texts above and to the right (left on versos) from the middle of each leaf&mdash;then the convention for all letterpress books. Although listed by William Michael Rossetti in his catalogue of Blake's drawings and paintings, published in the 1863 and 1880 editions of Alexander Gilchrist's <i>Life of William Blake</i>, the Gray illustrations were virtually unknown until their rediscovery by Herbert Grierson in 1919.</p><p>Blake's illustrations respond to Gray's poems in a variety of ways, but always with respect for the specifics in the text. Many motifs are visualizations&mdash;and hence literalizations&mdash;of Gray's metaphoric images. The Gray illustrations share iconographic and stylistic similarities with the <i>Night Thoughts</i> designs; both series are indebted to the pictorial imagery Blake developed in his illuminated books of the early- and mid-1790s. For the more comic passages in Gray's poems, Blake deployed a broad, almost caricature-like style. Many of the designs emphasize the imagination at work in the world through inspired acts of reading, writing, and performing music. </p>",but335.info.xml,0,,0,
Paintings Illustrating the Bible,paint,c. 1799-1803,1799,biblicaltemperas.jpg,,biblicaltemperas,"<p>The Bible had an enormous influence on Blake's work as both artist and poet.  Among his many and complex responses to that text is a group of paintings he created for his patron Thomas Butts, beginning in 1799.  Most were executed in that year and the next, but at least three were probably completed while Blake was in Felpham, 1802 and 1803.  Fifty-three of these ""cabinet paintings"" (as small works of this type were called in Blake's time) have been recorded.  Only thirty are now traceable, seven based on the Old Testament and the remainder on the New.</p><p>The medium of these paintings, now generally called ""tempera,"" is water-based with a glue and/or gum binder.  Blake applied his pigments in multiple layers, including intervening applications of transparent glue or gum.  Outlines were often reinforced with black ink and the finished compositions glazed with glue.  Blake was probably trying to create jewel-like paintings; in his <i>Descriptive Catalogue</i> of 1809, he compared them to ""enamels"" and ""precious stones"" (Erdman page 531).  He never used the word ""tempera"" but called his medium ""fresco""&mdash;a term that recalls Renaissance wall paintings&mdash;and claimed that he had invented the new genre of ""portable Fresco"" (<i>Exhibition of Paintings in Fresco</i>, Erdman pages 527), an alternative to paintings in oil.  Most were executed on canvas, but three are on copper and one (<i>The Agony in the Garden</i>) is on tinned iron.</p><p>Unfortunately, Blake's medium was inherently unstable.  The pigment layers expanded and contracted at different rates.  Almost all his temperas of 1799-1803 show considerable surface cracking and other defects; many have been repaired at least once.  Some, such as <i>The Miracle of the Loaves and Fishes</i>, have been over-painted in ways that misrepresent Blake's original work.</p><p>Blake's biblical temperas of 1799-1803 can be divided into two groups according to size.  Most are approximately 27 x 38 cm., but five of the extant paintings measure about 32.5 x 49.5 cm.  The works in the larger size illustrate the life of Christ and may form their own series.  The four paintings of the Evangelists (two extant) may constitute another sub-category. </p><p>Most of the biblical passages illustrated by these paintings are associated with long-standing iconographic conventions.  Blake appears to have been aware of these traditions, probably learned through reproductive engravings.  Blake's <i>Lot and His Daughters</i> is strikingly similar to Rubens' painting of the scene.  Although Matthew 2.14 does not indicate that Joseph, Mary, and Jesus were accompanied by guardian angels and putti in their journey to Egypt, Blake's <i>The Flight into Egypt</i> includes such figures in accord with many representations of the event from the fifteenth through the eighteenth centuries.</p><p>The paintings are arranged here according to the biblical texts illustrated.  Some of the subjects, including <i>The Christ Child Asleep on a Cross</i>, <i>The Body of Christ Borne to the Tomb</i>, and <i>Christ the Mediator</i>, are not based on specific passages but can be associated with events related in the Bible.</p>",biblicaltemperas.info.xml,1,"but379.1,but381.1,but382.1,but387.1,but390.1,but392.1,but394.1,but396.1,but400.1,but401.1,but403.1,but404.1,but406.1,but409.1,but410.1,but411.1,but415.1,but416.1,but417.1,but419.1,but420.1,but424.1,but425.1,but426.1,but429.1",0,

""Where any view of Money exists Art cannot be carried on."" ""Christianity is Art &amp; not Money"" (<i>Laoco&ouml;n</i>). Rail as he might about the destructive force of commerce and money as ""The Great Satan,"" Blake had to recognize that money is also ""the lifes blood of Poor Families"" (<i>Laoco&ouml;n</i>)&mdash;and Catherine and William Blake were often a poor family. Blake's biographer Gilchrist tells the story of Catherine Blake's way of reminding her husband that money was running out&mdash;by putting an empty plate in front of him. One hoped-for effect was money exchanged for goods or services, perhaps paintings, engravings, or drawing lessons&mdash;verified by a receipt.</p><p>Receipts remind us of bookkeepers and taxes. For most people most of the time, receipts surely fall near the bottom in rank order of interest and importance&mdash;until we need one that is missing or discover one that proves something otherwise uncertain or unknown. Their unstable place in the hierarchy of documents makes them rare. They tend to be small, easily overlooked, or discarded when the works they signify move along from place to place, generation to generation. The ones published here are survivors, and most have never been reproduced.</p><p>Blake's receipts often help to establish the first buyer of his works&mdash;and the date when a specified amount of money was exchanged for specified objects. Beyond that, the receipts teach lessons in the easily overlooked business side of Blake's arts and the arts of his era, in which he was a full if frustrated participant. And the documents are often striking. There are beautiful receipts in formal words, numbers, and symbols precisely inscribed in fancy handwriting, decorated with colorful seals that certify the transactions. Equally eye catching, there are scrawled, scratchy composites that are simply fascinating to look at. And there are, of course, plain, practical lists laid out more or less neatly in columns.</p><p>In our treatment of the receipts, we are departing from the editorial principles favored by earlier editors: Geoffrey Keynes mixed receipts and letters in a single chronologically ordered category; David V. Erdman largely excluded them; G. E. Bentley, Jr., excluded them from his edition of <i>William Blake's Writings</i> and moved them into an elaborate appendix to <i>Blake Records</i> that attempts to cover a broad range of transactions from multiple angles&mdash;including, for example, the receipts generated by Blake's customer, promoter, and friend John Linnell, a careful keeper of accounts, in the course of producing Blake's engraved <i>Illustrations of the Book of Job</i> (22 plates, 1823-26). Bentley assembled Linnell's payments to Blake but also to dealers in copper, ""french paper"" and ""Drawing paper,"" in specialized printing for engravings, and cloth bindings, among other products and services (<i>BR</i> 2nd ed., appendix 3, ""Blake's Accounts"").</p><p>We have decided instead to publish the receipts in adjacent but separate categories to focus attention on a distinctive commercial genre with some striking historical features. But the border between receipts and letters is porous because Blake's financial and personal dealings are entwined. As he embeds poems in his letters, complicating distinctions between them, he similarly personalizes sterile lists of products and prices with greetings, inquiries, and news. And sometimes what we label a receipt is strictly not&mdash;but rather, say, a formal contract to carry out a project on specified terms, such as the 25 March 1823 ""Memorandum of Agreement"" to engrave the drawings that would be published as <i>Illustrations of the Book of Job</i>&mdash;on copper plates that would be provided by Linnell. The agreement is in Linnell's hand, with signatures by both men. Deciding how to treat documents that defy the rules of our rigid categories is one of the questionable pleasures of editing.</p>",bb134.info.xml,0,,0,
Letters,ltr,1791-1827,1791,letters.jpg,,letters,"<p>Letters may be less often treasured and transmitted from generation to generation than works of art. Blake's surviving correspondence begins rather late in his career, in October 1791, the month before he turned 34, when he drops a short note to architect-editor Willey Reveley ""to embrace the offer of engraving such beautiful things""&mdash;drawings by William Pars for the third volume of James Stuart and Nicholas Revett's <i>Antiquities of Athens</i>, 1794&mdash;&amp; will do what he can by the end of January [1792]."" He writes his last letter, as far as we know, the month before his death at age 69 in August 1827&mdash;just three sentences to the friend and benefactor of his final decade, artist John Linnell, to thank him for sending ten pounds and to indicate that his ""journey to Hampstead on Sunday brought on a relapse . . . . however I am upon the mending hand to day &amp; hope soon to look as I did for I have been yellow accompanied by all the old Symptoms.""</p><p>About ninety-five of Blake's letters survive, an unknown fraction of the total. Several are known only from partial and full transcriptions in the second, expanded, edition of Alexander Gilchrist's <span style=""font-style:italic"">Life of William Blake</span> (1880). Blake traveled seldom and not very far, and he was little known beyond a small circle of British contemporaries, most of them in London. His circle of correspondents was narrow and the geographical circuit small. Only three correspondents&mdash;friends and patrons Thomas Butts, William Hayley, and John Linnell&mdash;occasion most of the letters. There are none addressed to such erstwhile friends and associates as Thomas Stothard, Joseph Johnson, and Henry Fuseli. No surviving letter traveled outside of England, and most letters simply traveled across town. But Blake's modest body of correspondence comprises an absorbing, revealing miscellany of simple business receipts, accounts, and reports on work in progress alongside friendly and not so friendly exchanges on matters of practical and intellectual substance. Occasionally they burst out into visions that amalgamate, in a characteristic Blakean vein, homely details, intensely energized prose, and inspired poetry.</p><p>Whether or not we concur with Geoffrey Keynes's estimation of Blake's best letters as worthy of ""an honoured place in any anthology of letters by men of genius"" (<i>Letters</i>, page xix), they are indispensable in preserving facts and contexts for his life and work that would be otherwise unknown and in showing him shift pragmatically from role to role in a very natural&mdash;and human&mdash;way, exposing facets of character and personality not always so apparent in his art. If he can be a self-advertising seeker of custom and patronage, he can also be a defensively boastful brother; a maker of excuses; an optimistic, excited participant; a miserable urban artisan trapped in the country, seeking comfort from London friends and patrons; a repatriated but terrified Londoner facing trial on charges of sedition stemming from a confrontation in the provinces&mdash;and now desperately dependent on Thomas Hayley, the Felpham patron whom he had come to resent if not despise.</p> <p>The letters feel closer to the externalities of everyday life than any other work from Blake's hand, and some start out to be one very ordinary thing and end up being another quite extraordinary thing. Blake's resistance to uniformity shows up in the range of expression of his most compelling letters&mdash;those grounded in everyday transactions but punctuated by bursts of artistic expression and intense thought colored by a volatile rainbow of anxiety, relief, stubborn resentment, pride, fury, disappointment, terror, frustration, hope, happiness, and even joy. Most of the letters have plain utilitarian purposes. Blake is not an artist-thinker in correspondence with an international circle; nonetheless, Blake being Blake, he seldom puts pen to paper without interesting consequences for readers, even when the primary aim is perfectly ordinary.</p> <p>G. E. Bentley, Jr., has created a list of letters that Blake may have written but are absent from the present record.

Epistolary evidence indicates that Blake was responsible for the unsigned plate.</p><p>By the end of 1799, Hayley was hurrying to prepare the poem for publication before the death of his terminally ill son, Thomas Alphonso Hayley. In a letter to Flaxman of 21 December, Hayley states ""I wish to have only the two following Decorations, if you approve them&mdash;a Frontispiece &amp; a vignette at the close&mdash;the first from poor Toms outline of Demosthenes at the base of Neptunes Statue . . . &amp; a neat small Head, as a closing vignette, from your medallion of the dear disciple [Thomas Hayley]"" (Bentley, <i>Records</i> page 85). In January 1800, Blake had been commissioned to execute these engravings (Objects 2 and 3), probably through the recommendation of Flaxman. In addition, Blake engraved the bust of Pericles after a drawing by Tom Hayley that became the frontispieces in the published work.  With his letter of 1 April 1800, Blake sent Hayley a proof of the medallion of Tom Hayley (Erdman page 705). On 17 April, Hayley responded with some criticisms of the proof and, after his son's death on 2 May, invited Blake to Felpham to complete the engraving (Bentley, <i>Records</i> pages 87-88, 90). </p><p>Blake spent at least three weeks working beside Hayley in Felpham during July 1800. He completed both a half-length drawing of Thomas Alphonso and the engraving of the medallion portrait (Object 3). Later that year, after Blake had relocated to Sussex, he painted a series of 18 portrait heads to decorate Hayley's library, including portraits of Thomas Alphonso and Demosthenes.</p>",bb467.info.xml,0,,0,

According to his <i>Memoirs</i>, Hayley composed the poem on 22 September 1800 ""to relieve the necessities of a meritorious poor Woman on the Kentish coast"" (Bentley, <i>Records</i>, pages 99-100). In a letter to Thomas Butts of 23 September, Blake states, ""I have begun to Work &amp; find &#8230that Felpham is propitious to the Arts"" (Erdman page 711). Blake was almost certainly referring to <i>Little Tom the Sailor</i>, which comprises head and tailpiece designs on separate plates, etched and engraved in white line, and the texts of Hayley's ballad and a colophon etched in relief on two copperplates.</p><p>Hayley probably gave Blake the ballad to etch on the day of its composition or shortly thereafter. The ballad was published, according to the colophon, on 5 October 1800. It therefore took Blake approximately thirteen days to relief etch the texts as well as design and execute the two illustrations. A preliminary sketch of the headpiece is in the Victoria and Albert Museum. To print the ballad, Blake placed his four plates one above the other in his rolling press and printed them on one leaf of paper.</p><p>By the end of the November 1800, the initial print run appears to have almost sold out. In a letter to Hayley of 26 November, Blake, referring to the ballad, claims, ""we can muster a few in colours and some in black which I hope will be no less favour'd tho' they are rough like rough sailors"" (Erdman page 714).

Eighteen Heads of Poets: Chaucer,paint,c. 1800-1803,1800.A,but343.5.1.pt.100.jpg,but343.5,but343,"<p>In 1800 Blake’s new patron William Hayley commissioned him to paint a series of portraits of famous poets to decorate the latter’s library at his residence, Turret House, in Felpham, Sussex.  Blake had at least begun preliminary work on these eighteen tempera paintings by the fall of 1800, as indicated by his letter to Hayley of 26 November: ""Absorbed by the poets Milton, Homer, Camoens, Ercilla, Ariosto, and Spenser, whose physiognomies have been my delightful study…"" (Erdman page 714).  Among these <i>Heads of Poets</i> is a portrait of Geoffrey Chaucer. His features and dress are probably based on an engraving by George Vertue published in John Urry’s 1721 <i>Works of Geoffrey Chaucer</i>. A copy of the book was in Hayley’s Library. One detail, however, suggests that Blake may have consulted other Chaucer portraits engraved by Vertue, one issued in 1730 among his series of ""Twelve Celebrated English Poets"" and another published in 1737 and 1740 editions of <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>. These two, like Blake's version, show three buttons on Chaucer's gown rather than the two buttons in the plate published with Urry's text.</p><p>In most of the eighteen paintings in the group, Blake included characters from the poet's works right and left of the central portrait. For Chaucer, Blake pictures the Merchant on the left and the Wife of Bath on the right, both from <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>.

As he told John Flaxman in a letter of 12 September 1800, ""Milton lovd me in childhood &amp; shewd me his face"" (Erdman page 707).  Several early drawings, such as the <i>Satan, Sin, and Death</i> of c. 1780 (Butlin 101), were probably inspired by Milton.  In 1790-92, Blake loosely sketched several illustrations to <i>Paradise Lost</i> in his Notebook (Butlin 201; see Related Works, below).  He composed his first series of water colors illustrating one of Milton's poems in 1801 when the Rev. Joseph Thomas commissioned the eight designs for <i>Comus</i> (Butlin 527) presented here.

For example, Milton ends his masque with joyous dance and song, but Blake ends his illustrations on a more serious note, as indicated by the facial expressions of all six figures.  The selection of passages to illustrate in itself reveals Blake's emphasis on unusual states of consciousness, including trances and visions.</p><p>Blake's literary response to the life and works of John Milton finds its fullest expression in the illuminated book <i>Milton a Poem</i>.</p>",but528.info.xml,0,,0,
"William Hayley, Designs to a Series of Ballads",comb,1802,1802,bb466.2.1.com.100.jpg,bb466.2,bb466,"<p>While Blake was resident in Felpham on the Sussex coast, his new patron William Hayley began to write a series of ballads to be illustrated by the artist-engraver.  These were published in 1802 as quarto numbers, each with three engravings by Blake.  As the general title page indicates, the poems all deal with ""Anecdotes Relating to Animals.""  In his ""Preface,"" Hayley states that his plan was to issue one ballad a month, ""and to complete the whole series in fifteen Numbers.""  The letterpress text was printed by the Chichester printer Joseph Seagrave; the plates were printed by Blake and his wife Catherine on their own rolling press.  Although two book dealers, P. Humphry and R. H. Evans, were selected to sell the ballads, most copies seem to have been sold by Hayley to his friends.  Sales were less than brisk and the project ceased after only four ballads were issued.  Blake designed and executed twelve plates, including a frontispiece for the general title page and a tailpiece to the ""Preface,"" both issued with the first ballad.  Two further plates were engraved by Blake after designs on antique gems (Plates 5 and 11).</p><p>The London bookseller Richard Phillips published an octavo edition of fifteen ballads by Hayley in 1805.  For this volume, Blake engraved new plates of his designs for three of the ballads first published in 1802 and both designed and engraved new illustrations for two of the additional ballads.</p>",bb466.info.xml,0,,0,
"William Hayley, The Life, and Posthumous Writings, of William Cowper",comeng,1803-04,1803.B,bb468.1.1.com.100.jpg,bb468.1,bb468,"<p>William Hayley's three-volume biography of his friend and fellow poet, William Cowper, was an immediate success when published and did much to established Cowper's reputation as a man of letters. The first two volumes were published in 1803 and the third the following year. The work contains six plates, all signed by Blake as the engraver. Blake also signed one plate, known as ""The Weather House"" (Object 4) as the designer, although the roundel in the lower portion of the design picturing three hares was probably based on a design by George Romney. Blake's work on these engravings was scrutinized by members of Hayley's circle, notably Cowper's cousin, Lady Harriet Hesketh, and their criticisms may have led to some of the friction that appears in Blake's relationship with Hayley from 1801 onward.</p><p>The plates for Hayley's biography of Cowper constitute one of the first commissions Blake worked on during his three-year sojourn on the West Sussex coast. In a letter to Thomas Butts of 11 September 1801, Blake states that his ""Principal labour at this time is Engraving Plates for Cowpers Life"" (Erdman page 716). Writing to his brother James two years later, on 30 January 1803, Blake states that his wife Catherine ""has undertaken to Print the whole number of the Plates for [the first two volumes of] Cowpers work"" (Erdman page 726). </p><p>Blake made two drawings of Cowper after Romney's portrait of the poet.  These were the basis for two miniature paintings of Cowper and the portrait engraving that is the frontispiece for Hayley's biography (Object 1). There are also four drawings of the designs for Cowper's funeral monument that Blake produced at Hayley's request in 1802.  The first two drawings are Hayley's first idea for the monument and were sent to John Flaxman who was commissioned to sculpt the monument. The third drawing revises Hayley's first idea and was the basis from Flaxman's finished monument as well as Blake's engraving, which was published in the third volume of Hayley's biography (Object 6). Blake made two drawings of this second idea, presumably one for Flaxman to sculpt and the other for Blake to engrave.</p>",bb468.info.xml,0,,0,
"William Hayley, The Triumphs of Temper",comeng,1803,1803.A,bb471.1.1.com.100.jpg,bb471.1,bb471,"<p>First published in 1781, William Hayley's long mock-epic poem was one of the most popular works of the final decades of the eighteenth century. Heavily indebted to Alexander Pope's <i>The Rape of the Lock</i>, Hayley's didactic poem seeks to teach adolescent girls to become accomplished wives by exercising their temper.  The sixth edition of the poem, published in 1788, was the first to be illustrated; it contains seven plates after designs by Thomas Stothard. In 1803, Hayley commissioned Blake to engrave a series of new illustrations based on designs by  John Flaxman's half-sister, Maria Flaxman, for a twelfth edition of the poem. She produced seven designs, of which Blake engraved six.</p><p>Blake worked on these plates for the first six months of 1803. In his letter to Thomas Butts of 10 January 1803, Blake reports that he was ""now engaged in Engraving 6 small plates for a New Edition of M<sup>r</sup> Hayleys Triumphs of Temper. from drawings by Maria Flaxman sister to my friend the Sculptor"" (Erdman page 723). At the end of the month, on 30 January, Blake informs his brother James of the commission and state that he would be paid ""10 G[uineas]"" for each plate (Erdman page 726). By the end of June, the engravings were evidently complete, for Hayley sent a copy of the twelfth edition to Lady Harriet Hesketh, William Cowper's cousin. In a letter of 1 July, she tells Hayley of her disappointment with the prints. In a letter to John Flaxman of 7 August 1803, Hayley, presumably referring to Hesketh's comments, states: ""I am sorry to say that the Ladies (&amp; it is a Ladys Book) find fault with the Engravings&mdash; our poor industrious Blake has received sixty Guineas for them from my Bookseller &amp; I believe both the artist &amp; the paymaster are dissatisfied on the occasion"" (Bentley, <i>Records</i> page 157). In the same letter, Hayley also reports that he and Blake made the decision to omit from the engravings the figure of Minerva represented in one of Maria Flaxman's original designs. In response, John Flaxman remarked in a letter to Hayley of 24 August 1803 that one of his half-sister's drawings depicting ""Serena viewing herself in the Glass when dressed for the Masquerade whilst her Maid adjusts her train"" was overlooked for engraving (Bentley, <i>Records</i> page 166).</p><p>Two of Maria Flaxman's original designs were on display at the Royal Academy annual exhibition in 1800. All seven drawings were sold at auction at Christie's on 26 February 1883. These are currently untraced.</p><p>Blake's engravings were repeated in a very small print run of the thirteenth edition of <i>The Triumphs of Temper</i>, published in 1807. The copperplates had worn significantly and were replaced by the original engravings after designs by Stothard in another 1807 issue of the poem.</p>",bb471.info.xml,0,,0,
Portrait of George Romney,speng,1803-05,1803,bbwba14.1.1.sp.100.jpg,bbwba14.1,bbwba14,"<p>In the final months of his three-year sojourn in Felpham, Blake began working on two sketches based on a painting of a shipwreck and a self-portrait by the artist George Romney. These were prepared as preliminary drawings for engravings to illustrate Hayley's biography of Romney. In a letter to John Flaxman of 7 August 1803, Hayley reveals that Blake had ""made two excellent drawings of Romney,"" one of which was after an unfinished self-portrait of Romney in Hayley's possession, before stating that he intends for both drawings to be ""engraved for a single quarto volume of [Romney's] Life"" (Bentley, <i>Records</i>, page 157). In the same letter, Hayley reveals that after some haggling with Blake over fees, they had agreed on a price of 40 guineas for a portrait engraving of Romney's self-portrait.</p><p>Shortly after he returned to London, Blake wrote to Hayley on 7 October 1803, stating ""I lose no moment to complete Romney to satisfaction"" (Erdman page 736). Over the next few weeks Blake made significant progress on the plate, informing Hayley on 26 October, ""I go on finishing Romney with spirit"" (Erdman page 738). In a letter to Hayley of 13 December, Blake implies that the plate was sufficiently finished for proofs to be taken: ""M<sup>r</sup> Romney[s] Portrait goes on with spirit. I do not send a proof because I cannot get one the Printers [<i>being</i>] &lt;having been this afternoon&gt; unable or unwilling &amp; my Press not yet being put up"" (Erdman page 739). By the beginning of May 1804, Blake had either assembled his own press or convinced the copperplate printer to pull a proof impression, which Blake showed to one of Romney's oldest friends, Adam Walker (Blake's letter to Hayley, 4 May 1804, Erdman page 748). On 22 June Blake offered Hayley another update, citing his former partner, James Parker, to emphasize the plate's quality: ""Head of Romney is in very great forwardness. Parker commends it highly. Flaxman has not yet seen it. but shall soon, &amp; then you shall have a Proof of it for your remarks also"" (Erdman page 753). On 16 July 1804 Blake finally sent Hayley a proof, ""still [in] an unfinishd state"" (Erdman page 753).</p><p>Blake continued to work on the portrait engraving during the second half of 1804. In his letter of 7 August, Blake describes working on ""Romneys Head"" with ""Spirit &amp; neatness."" In a letter to Hayley of 28 September, Blake promises a second proof of the engraving: ""You shall soon see a Proof of Him in a very advancd state. I have not yet proved it but shall soon when I will send you one"" (Erdman page 755). On 23 October Blake claims that he will soon send proofs of ""the Head of R"" and repeats this claim in his letter of 4 December (Erdman pages 756-57). Blake finally sent Hayley the second proof on 18 December and ten days later sent Hayley a letter commenting that ""I am very far from shewing the Portrait of Romney as a finishd Proof. be assured that with our Good Flaxmans good help &amp; with your remarks on it in addition I hope to make it a Supernaculum"" (Erdman pages 758-60). In a postscript, Blake reiterates his claim that the portrait engraving required more work: ""I made a very high finishd Drawing &lt;of Romney&gt; as a Companion to my &lt;drawings of the&gt; head of Cowper (you remember) with which Flaxman is very much satisfied &amp; says that when my Print is like that I need wish it no better, &amp; I am determind to make it so at least"" (Erdman page 760). Despite these assurances, Hayley did not include the engraving in his biography of Romney, not published until 1809. Only Blake's engraving of the shipwreck design appears in the book.</p><p>Blake's sketch for the Romney portrait engraving was auctioned at Sotheby's on 29 April 1862, lot 178, but has not been recorded since that sale. In his 1942 edition of Alexander Gilchrist's <i>Life of William Blake</i>, Ruthven Todd claims that a copy of the engraving was in the Rosenwald Collection. There is, however, no record of it in that collection, now divided between the National Gallery of Art, Washington, and the Library of Congress.

In the poem's first ""Book,"" John Milton returns from heaven to the mortal world and unites with the imagination through the person of William Blake. Together, they set out to reconfigure the relationship between a living poet and a great predecessor. In the second and final book, Milton unites with his feminine aspect, Ololon, in progress towards the apocalyptic overcoming of divisions between the sexes, between the living and the dead, and between human consciousness and its alienated projections into the external world. This plot is integrated with expansive references and allusions that range from the Bible to Blake's own life, particularly the difficult relationship with his patron William Hayley. Portions of <cite>The Four Zoas</cite>, Blake's long manuscript poem, are repeated (often with little revision) in <cite>Milton</cite>.</p><p>Blake etched forty-five plates for <cite>Milton</cite> in relief, with some full-page designs in white-line etching, between c. 1804 (the date on the title page) and c. 1811.

His first efforts were a small group of wash drawings  of the mid-1780s showing Job in his misery with his wife and three friends (Butlin 162-164). Another version of this subject appears  among Blake's emblem series he sketched in his Notebook (Butlin  201.20), but the composition appearing in the wash drawings  culminated in the large intaglio etching/engraving, ""Job"" (Essick  V) which Blake listed in his advertisement <i>To the Public</i> of 10 October 1793. This print may have stimulated Blake's chief  patron, Thomas Butts, to commission a tempera painting, <cite>Job and His Daughters</cite> (Butlin 394) c. 1799-1800 and, about six years later, a series of nineteen water colors illustrating the  story of Job (Butlin 550, the so-called ""Butts Set""). In 1821,  Blake and his new patron John Linnell borrowed the water colors  from Butts. Linnell traced the series and Blake colored them  (Butlin 551, the so-called ""Linnell Set""). Blake also added two more compositions to this later group and added versions of these  same compositions to the earlier group, so that both sets now have  twenty-one designs. The Linnell set led directly to his  commissioning engravings. These began as a series of reduced sketches executed in 1823 (Butlin 557); the engravings themselves, with a title page added, were not finished and published until  1826.</p> <p>The Butts set of twenty-one water colors is presented here. Its dating is based on stylistic features, the history of commissions  from Butts, and the presence, on two of the designs (5, 11), of  Blake's near-monogram ""WB inv,"" which Blake began to abandon c. 1806.</p> <p>Blake follows the general outline of the story of Job in the  Bible, but also incorporates into his designs many motifs  representing his personal interpretation. At the beginning, Job and his family attend only to the letter, rather than the spirit, of God's laws. Job thereby falls under a false conception of God and  into the hands of Satan. Job's sufferings are recorded in the first  half of the series, culminating in his horrific vision of a devil-god in the eleventh design. Job's spiritual education and  material restoration are pictured in the second half of the series. In the penultimate design, Job tells his story to his daughters; the entire family is restored to life in the final design. Some  critics and biographers have interpreted the Job series as personal statements about Blake's own tribulations and the spiritual peace he found late in life. However appealing this approach may be, it is made questionable by the earlier dating of the Butts series, the basis for all the later works.</p>",but550.info.xml,0,,0,

Blake had lost the potentially lucrative commission to engrave his own designs; his relationship with Cromek descended into anger and argument. In spite of their disagreement, Cromek included a portrait of Blake as a frontispiece to the volume, published in 1808. Cromek promoted the book aggressively and the illustrations to <i>The Grave</i> became Blake's best known work through much of the nineteenth century.</p> <p>The published volume includes Blake's dedicatory poem ""To the Queen,"" a prefatory comment on the designs by Henry Fuseli, and a concluding section ""Of the Designs"" (unsigned, but probably by Benjamin Heath Malkin). The last presents an alternative arrangement of the plates independent of the textual sequence of lines illustrated. A second edition was published by Rudolph Ackermann in 1813; he also reprinted the plates, with inscribed titles in Spanish, in Jose Joaquin de Mora's <i>Meditaciones Poeticas</i> (1826), a series of poems written in response to Blake's designs. Nineteen of the finished water-color preliminary drawings for <i>The Grave</i> were rediscovered in 2001, as noted for each in the list of ""Related Works,"" below. For this group, see ""<a href=""&#xA; /work/butwba10"">Illustrations to Robert Blair's <i>The Grave</i></a>"" under Water Color Drawings in the main table of ""Works in the William Blake Archive.""

His selection of subjects and themes emphasizes immortality more than death, the latter often presented as a passage to the former. Although Cromek very probably made the final selection of designs to publish, they tend to fall into contrastive pairs in format and theme&mdash;e.g., death of the wicked man/death of the good man, parting of the soul and body/reunion of the soul and body.</p>",bb435.info.xml,0,,0,
"Descriptions of ""L'Allegro"" and ""Il Penseroso"" Designs",ms,c. 1816-20,1816.B,bb69.1.1.ms.100.jpg,bb69.1,bb69,"<p>The poetry of John Milton was important to Blake as both poet and artist from his earliest years. As he told John Flaxman in a letter of 12 September 1800, ""Milton lovd me in childhood &amp; shewd me his face"" (Erdman page 707). Several early drawings, such as the <cite>Satan, Sin, and Death</cite> of c. 1780 (Butlin 101), were probably inspired by Milton. In 1790-92, Blake loosely sketched several illustrations to <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> in his Notebook (Butlin 201; see Related Works, below). He composed his first series of water colors illustrating one of Milton's poems in 1801 when the Rev. Joseph Thomas commissioned eight designs for <cite>Comus</cite> (Butlin 527). Thomas later acquired (very probably on commission) a set of twelve water color illustrations to <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> in 1807 (Butlin 529) and six water colors illustrating ""On the Morning of Christ's Nativity"" in 1809 (Butlin 538). Between 1808 and 1815, Blake produced similar (but not in every respect identical) sets of the <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> and ""Nativity"" designs for Thomas Butts (Butlin 529, 542), to which he added the twelve illustrations to ""L'Allegro"" and ""Il Penseroso"" c. 1816-20 (Butlin 543) presented here. Although we can be confident that Butts was the first owner of these illustrations and very probably commissioned them, there are no extant records of such a commission. The dating of the water colors is based on the presence of an ""1816"" watermark in six of the designs and on stylistic features, particularly the high degree of finish with fine brush strokes, indicative of Blake's later style.</p><p>Each design is accompanied by a separate sheet of paper on which Blake wrote in pen and ink a brief title, now considered the verso of each sheet because glued to a backing sheet. The rectos of the inscribed sheets bear pen and ink quotations, in Blake's hand, of the lines illustrated, to which Blake added his own comments on the motifs pictured. These quotations and comments are of course important in understanding Blake's pictorial responses to ""L'Allegro"" and ""Il Penseroso."" The rectos of these inscribed sheets are presented here, each following the water color to which it refers. Because of the backing sheets, the verso inscriptions can only be read with the aid of a strong backing light, but they cannot be photographed. Thus, they are included here in the Editors' Notes, but they are not reproduced.</p><p>As is typical of his work as an illustrator of the works of other poets, Blake paid close attention to the text, but this disciplined approach did not preclude the inclusion of his own interpretations. In itself the selection of passages to illustrate indicates Blake's emphasis on imaginative states of consciousness, including dreams and visions.</p><p>Blake's literary response to the life and works of John Milton finds its fullest expression in the illuminated book <cite>Milton a Poem</cite> (c. 1804-10; see Related Works, below).</p>",allegropenseroso.info.xml,0,,0,
"Sketches for Robert Blair's ""The Grave""",penc,1805,1805,gravepd.jpg,,gravepd,"<p>In October 1805, Blake was commissioned by the engraver and would-be publisher Robert H. Cromek to prepare forty drawings illustrating Robert Blair's <i>The Grave</i>, a popular ""Graveyard"" school poem first published in 1743. Cromek planned to select twenty of these designs for a de luxe edition of the poem. In Cromek's first prospectus of November 1805, Blake is named as both the designer and engraver of fifteen designs. Blake etched one image, ""Deaths Door,"" in white-line, but Cromek rejected it. The dark power of the white-line print appeals to modern tastes, but was far from fashionable in the early nineteenth century.  In a second prospectus, also of November 1805, Cromek announced that Louis Schiavonetti would engrave twelve designs for the new edition.

Most are rough first thoughts on paper; some were developed into finished water colors and engraved by Schiavonetti, but other designs were not further developed.

The Pickering Manuscript,ms,c. 1807,1807,bb126.1.1.ms.100.jpg,bb126.1,bb126,"<p>An intriguing glimpse of the Pickering Manuscript poems surfaces on 16 August 1803, the month before Blake's return to London after three years in Felpham, Sussex. The increasingly miserable artist-in-residence for William Hayley writes his London friend and patron Thomas Butts a letter that attempts to give some ""Picture of my Present state I pray God to keep you &amp; all men from it &amp; to deliver me in his own good time."" Blake's verbal self-portrait culminates in three stanzas that open with an exclamatory couplet: ""O why was I born with a different face / Why was I not born like the rest of my race"" (Erdman pages 733-34). </p> <p>He varied that couplet only slightly in the separate poem ""<a href=""&#xA; /copy/bb126.1?descId=bb126.1.ms.08"">Mary</a>,"" which may have been composed around the same time. At some point he copied ""Mary"" neatly into a 22-page manuscript with nine other poems, seven known from no other source. Not earlier than 1802, probably after the abandonment of the quarto <i>Ballads</i> project in 1805 (see Blake's letter to William Hayley, 22 January 1805, Erdman pages 762-63), Blake reutilized paper that had been used in Hayley's <i>Designs to a Series of Ballads</i>, 1802 (to which Blake had contributed engraved illustrations), trimmed off Hayley's printed texts (and with them the 1802 watermark), and on the spacious inside margins wrote out the ten poems that constitute the Pickering Manuscript&mdash;named after B. M. Pickering (1836-1878), one of its several nineteenth century owners.</p> <p>The poems may have been composed from about 1800 through perhaps 1804 (see Bentley, <i>Blake Books</i> pages 341-42). In the final manuscript version, the clarity and formality of the hand, the neatness and uniformity of the arrangement, the scarcity of changes, and even the number of poems tantalizingly suggest a specific occasion for the collection. But there are no designs, no title page, and no concrete evidence to indicate whether Blake intended some form of publication or, perhaps, as David Erdman suggests, made the collection for a friend or patron (Erdman page 859n). If so, that friend or patron never received it. It remained with Blake's wife Catherine after his death in 1827. The poems were not published until 1866&mdash;the year Pickering bought the manuscript&mdash;in <i>Songs of Innocence and Experience, with Other Poems</i>, edited by R. H. Shepherd.</p> <p>In attempts to capture the character of the collection in a title, it has also been called the Ballads Manuscript (Bentley) and the Auguries Manuscript (Johnson and Grant). Its sometimes ballad-like poems range in length from sixteen lines in four stanzas reminiscent of the <i>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</i> (""<a href=""&#xA; /copy/bb126.1?descId=bb126.1.ms.01"">The Smile</a>"") to one undivided sequence of 132 aphoristic lines (""<a href=""&#xA; /copy/bb126.1?descId=bb126.1.ms.13"">Auguries of Innocence</a>""), with the other poems at various lengths in between. All have, in one way or another, strong precedents in earlier work&mdash;characteristic subject matter, ideology, and attitude; ballad- and hymn-like structures built upon characteristic rhythms, rhymes, and repetitions; a striking penchant (and talent) for aphorism and invented proverb; and strong ironies in strange mixtures of story and saying, among other familiar traits. No one who has read the <i>Songs</i> and the Proverbs of Hell in <i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i> will fail to recognize the poetic neighborhood of the Pickering Manuscript as Blake's.</p> <p>But he must have sensed that these were ten instances of particularly masterful&mdash;refined, powerful, compelling, inspired&mdash;poetry underwritten by an increasingly codified mythology. Thus one of the most elegant and memorable narratives of the Pickering group, ""The Mental Traveller,"" is the kind of poem that has helped give Blake the reputation of an artist who ""must Create a System, or be enslav'd by another Mans"" (as his hero Los says in <i>Jerusalem</i> Plate 10, Erdman page 153). Like some other poems in the group, ""The Mental Traveller"" comes across as a module that Blake could easily have slipped into his more extended mythopoeic ventures. It encapsulates with extraordinary concision a smooth, dark core of Blake's storytelling: ""She lives upon his shrieks &amp; cries / And She grows young as he grows old"" (<a href=""&#xA; /copy/bb126.1?descId=bb126.1.ms.03"">Object 3</a>). Like most of the poems in this grouping, ""The Mental Traveller"" is sharp but enigmatic, as if it can simultaneously know precisely what it is about but remain baffling to readers who want to crack its code.</p> <p>Then again, the manuscript also beckons to readers (and poets, artists, and musicians, because these are among Blake's most influential lines) who want light with their darkness&mdash;who prefer their unsparing social insights balanced against hope and healing. This attractive, popular Blake is best represented here in the long aphoristic sequence ""Auguries of Innocence,"" where ""under every grief &amp; pine / Runs a joy with silken twine,"" ""Man was made for Joy &amp; Woe,"" and it is possible ""To see a World in a Grain of Sand / And a Heaven in a Wild Flower / Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand / And Eternity in an hour"" (<a href=""&#xA; /copy/bb126.1?descId=bb126.1.ms.16"">Object 16</a>). Miraculous acts of imagination can be achieved even in a world where ""The Harlots cry from Street to Street / Shall weave Old Englands winding Sheet"" (<a href=""&#xA; /copy/bb126.1?descId=bb126.1.ms.18"">Object 18</a>) and ""The Babe that weeps the Rod beneath / Writes Revenge in realms of death"" (<a href=""&#xA; /copy/bb126.1?descId=bb126.1.ms.16"">Object 16</a>).</p>",bb126.info.xml,0,,0,

Exhibition of Paintings in Fresco,te,1809,1809.A,,bb36.a,bb36,"<p>This flyer contains an advertisement for Blake's 1809 exhibition and a one-page text on ""The Invention of a portable Fresco,"" dated May 15, 1809 (in pen and ink in both recorded copies).

Blake had enclosed ""a ticket of admission"" to his exhibition and a short letter asserting that ""Florentine &amp; Venetian Art cannot exist together"" and the destruction of the latter ""will be shortly accomplish'd,"" claims he expounds upon in the exhibition's <i>Descriptive Catalogue</i>.</p><p>Of the nine tempera paintings and seven water colors exhibited, Blake's advertisement singles out his two largest works, <i>The Ancient Britons</i>, now lost, and ""The Canterbury Pilgrims from <i>Chaucer</i>,"" later titled <i>Sir Jeffery Chaucer and the Nine and Twenty Pilgrims on Their Journey to Canterbury</i> (Butlin 653). He also references ""Two Pictures, representing grand Apotheoses of Nelson and Pitt,"" later titled <i>The Spiritual Form of Nelson Guiding Leviathan</i> (Butlin 649) and <i>The Spiritual Form of Pitt Guiding Behemoth</i> (Butlin 651), respectively. These works, together with the ""variety of cabinet Pictures"" comprising the exhibition, are also described in greater detail in the <i>Descriptive Catalogue</i>.</p><p>Blake's short text on ""portable Fresco"" envisions the walls of any ""great Building,"" such as ""Westminster Hall,"" ornamented with frescos, Blake's term for water colors. These designs ""would be removable at pleasure."" Such portability would have allowed the large works of Raphael and Michelangelo to be transported to England. Blake claims to have recovered the lost art of ""Fresco Painting"" and applied it to works ""larger than Life."" Preferring the color-retaining quality of fresco to oil, which ""grows yellow, and at length brown,"" Blake laments his exclusion from the Royal Academy and the British Institution, both of which had refused to exhibit fresco designs. This rejection motivated his solo exhibition: ""it is therefore become necessary that I should exhibit to the Public, in an Exhibition of my own, my Designs, Painted in Water-colours.</p>",bb36.info.xml,0,,1,
A Descriptive Catalogue,te,1809,1809.B,bb32.d.1.typ.100.jpg,bb32.d,bb32,"<p>Printed by a job printer in a small run, perhaps fewer than one hundred copies, <i>A Descriptive Catalogue of Pictures, Poetical and Historical Inventions, Painted by William Blake, in Water Colours, Being the Ancient Method of Fresco Painting Restored: and [water color] Drawings, For Public Inspection, and for Sale by Private Contract</i> accompanied his self-organized one-man exhibition of 1809-10. It hung in the rooms above his brother's haberdashery shop in Soho&mdash;Blake's childhood home. The price of the catalogue included admission to the exhibition.</p><p>British artists spent much of the later eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries struggling to find viable commercial outlets. Lamenting that they lacked the infrastructure of patronage, exhibition, and refined understanding that supported Continental artists, they promoted the formation of new institutions, such as the Royal Academy and the British Institution, to add gravity and legitimacy to match commercial opportunity. Commercial gallery schemes such as Boydell's Shakspeare Gallery were popular if unsuccessful marketing experiments. Diverse individual and group exhibitions, both fixed and traveling, were attempted in locales from Green Park to the Royal Academy to the homes of individual artists, such as J. M. W. Turner, who devoted domestic space to the exhibition of their work. Descriptive catalogues and other printed documentation were a regular part of these innovations in art marketing.</p><p>Blake's catalogue describes sixteen pictures, nine in his version of ""portable fresco"" (gum- or glue-based tempera), seven in water color&mdash;several of those borrowed from his patron Thomas Butts. The exhibition was anchored by two of the temperas, <i>Sir Jeffery Chaucer and the Nine and Twenty Pilgrims on Their Journey to Canterbury</i>&mdash;described perceptively in considerable detail and afterwards engraved&mdash;and <i>The Ancient Britons</i>, by far the largest painting Blake ever executed. It and four others are now lost.</p><p>Henry Crabb Robinson later characterized Blake's catalogue as a ""veritable folio of fragmentary utterances on art and religion, without plan or arrangement"" (<i>Blake Records</i> page 450). Rhetorically, it is a high decibel, cacophonous, aggressive amalgam of painting by painting descriptions punctuated with strong statements of artistic principle colored by enthusiasm, resentment, blame, and defensiveness, sharpened by hints of conspiracy, technical description, and assorted other forays, often within a single entry. Blake makes his usual appeal ""to the Public""&mdash;the authentic, idealized public in which he consistently claims to have faith&mdash;as a refuge from the villains of commerce, politics, and bad art.</p><p>It is easy to see why Robert (brother of Leigh) Hunt, the only reviewer, charged Blake, ""an unfortunate lunatic,"" with having produced ""a farrago of nonsense, unintelligibleness, and egregious vanity, the wild effusions of a distempered brain"" (<i>The Examiner</i> 17 Sept. 1809, <i>Blake Records</i> page 283). But Charles Lamb, tolerant of eccentricity, was ""delighted"" with the catalogue, according to Crabb Robinson (<i>Blake Records</i> page 694). Of course, the crusade that Blake attempted to launch with his exhibition was in one sense mad&mdash;or at least hopelessly quixotic, yet another dismal failure to secure recognition, respect, and income. We have no attendance records, but what slender evidence there is suggests that the exhibition and catalogue attracted little other than sufficient public mockery and scorn to wound and infuriate Blake once again.</p><p>But, more broadly, the exhibition signaled a pivot from the battered hopes of an inventive youth and middle age&mdash;years when Blake was often able to claim some of Britain's best artists as supporters, despite a string of major disappointments&mdash;into his last two decades, ultimately brightened by the appearance of a new generation of artistically sympathetic young admirers and sponsors. The catalogue and the exhibition it registers are products of new, or renewed, artistic ideas and projects, bolstered by a determination to crusade openly for the reformation of British art&mdash;to eliminate its commercialism and return (as Blake imagined it) to older, purer, original forms of expression represented by Michelangelo and Raphael, who he thought united conception and execution in coherent lines lost by modern British oil portraitists such as Joshua Reynolds, whose elaborate effects of tone and color were mere pretty, superficial distractions from the impoverished, incoherent&mdash;in Blake's lexicon, blurred and blotted&mdash;visions beneath them. The 1809 exhibition and catalogue aim to call Reynolds's bluff, as it were, by showing modern artists and audiences how to shed the hypocrisies of blotting and blurring and return to the truth of vision expressed in media, such as ""the Ancient Method of Fresco Painting Restored,"" that could bear the weight of truth.</p>",bb32.info.xml,0,,0,

Blake sent Hayley the preparatory drawing with his letter of 16 July 1804 (Erdman page 753) and, in an untraced letter from Hayley, received permission to begin the engraving. Blake spent the rest of the year working sporadically on the print and keeping Hayley regularly updated on his progress. In his letter of 7 August 1804, Blake informs his patron that he is working on the engraving and in his letter of 28 September 1804 states that he will soon send Hayley a proof (Erdman pages 754-55).

Several early drawings, such as the <cite>Satan, Sin, and Death</cite> of c. 1780 (Butlin 101), were probably inspired by Milton.

He composed his first series of water colors illustrating one of Milton's poems in 1801 when the Rev. Joseph Thomas commissioned eight designs for <cite>Comus</cite> (Butlin 527). Thomas later acquired (very probably on commission) a set of twelve water color illustrations to <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> in 1807 (Butlin 529) and, in 1809, the six water colors illustrating ""On the Morning of Christ's Nativity"" presented here (Butlin 538). Between 1808 and 1815, Blake produced similar (but not in every respect identical) sets of the <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> and ""Nativity"" designs for Thomas Butts (Butlin 529, 542). The Butts set of the ""Nativity Ode"" water colors is now in the Huntington Library and Art Gallery.</p> <p>Blake's interest in the ""Nativity Ode"" began some years before his execution of these water colors. His illuminated book, <cite>Europe a Prophecy</cite> (1794), clearly shows the influence of Milton's ode. By 1809, Blake may have taken a renewed interest in the poem because of his increasingly Christocentric theological views.

Blake's Chaucer: An Original Engraving,te,1810,1810,,bb11.a,bb11,"<p>This second and longer of the two advertisements that Blake issued for his engraving, <i>Chaucers</i><i> Canterbury Pilgrims</i>, was printed in 1810. The previous year Blake had exhibited his tempera painting, <i>Sir Jeffery Chaucer and the Nine and Twenty Pilgrims on Their Journey to Canterbury </i>(Butlin 653) along with eight other paintings and seven water colors. The first one-page prospectus, published in May 1809, the same month as the exhibition, promised that the engraving would be completed in September 1810. This second advertisement is a three-page leaflet containing the title of the work, its dimensions (""Three Feet 1 Inch long, and 1 Foot high""), and its price, ""Three Guineas,"" lowered from the four guineas listed for subscribers in the prospectus from the previous year.</p><p>The bulk of the 1810 advertisement is devoted to a description of the design, including the setting, ""early morning before sun-rise when the Jolly Company are just quitting the Tabarde Inn,"" a list of Chaucer’s characters and their location within the composition, and further details concerning the inn and surrounding landscape. Blake concludes the advertisement with the assertion that despite their names being altered by time, ""the Characters themselves for ever remain unaltered and consequently they are the Physiognomies or Leneaments of Universal Human Life beyond which Nature never steps."" The engraving was completed in October of 1810.</p>",bb11.info.xml,0,,1,
The Prologue and Characters of Chaucer's Pilgrims,comb,1812,1812,bb443.2.1.com.100.jpg,bb443.2,bb443,"<p>This edition of the ""Prologue"" to Geoffrey Chaucer's <i>Canterbury Tales</i> was published as a companion and advertisement for Blake's large engraving, ""Chaucers Canterbury Pilgrims,"" dated 1810 in the imprint. As the title page states, the book is ""intended to illustrate a particular design of Mr. William Blake, which is engraved by himself.""  The brief ""Preface"" also highlights Blake's work: ""To the genius and fancy of that celebrated Artist Mr Blake, it occurred, that tho' the names and habits of men altered by time, yet their characters remained the same; and as Chaucer had drawn them Four Hundred years past, he might as justly delineate them at the present period, and by a pleasant picture, bring to our imagination the merry company setting out upon their journey."" The ""Preface"" is not signed, but Alexander Gilchrist, in his 1863 <i>Life of William Blake</i>, suggests that the author is ""possibly"" Blake's friend, Benjamin Heath Malkin (1: 243). The comment about changing ""names and habits"" and unaltered ""characters"" echoes Blake's own statements about Chaucer's pilgrims in his <i>Descriptive Catalogue</i> of 1809. If Malkin is the author of the ""Preface,"" he very probably consulted either the <i>Descriptive Catalogue</i> or Blake himself. Chaucer's text is presented in two forms on facing pages, the original Middle English, taken from Thomas Speght's 1687 edition, and a ""modernis'd"" version published in 1741 by George Ogle.</p><p>Object 1, the frontispiece to the volume, is a reduced version of the left side of the separate plate, ""Chaucers Canterbury Pilgrims,"" extending from the Reeve (far left) to the Merchant. There are several differences in scale and details, notably in the inscriptions over the portal of ""THE TABARDE INNE,"" the windows upper left, the number and configuration of the white birds on the roof, and the Gothic architecture seen through the portal and in the background. The shafts of light in the sky do not appear in this area in the separate plate.</p><p>Object 2, a view of Canterbury Cathedral, serves as a tailpiece to the modernized text, page 58. The large Gothic window and twin towers at the left end of the building are a fair representation of the Cathedral as it presently appears; the pointed third tower to the right does not match its present construction. Although unsigned, the etching/engraving was almost certainly designed and engraved by Blake.</p>",bb443.info.xml,0,,1,

He composed his first series of water colors illustrating one of Milton's poems in 1801 when the Rev. Joseph Thomas commissioned eight designs for <cite>Comus</cite> (Butlin 527). In 1809, Blake produced for Thomas a set of six illustrations to Milton's ""On the Morning of Christ's Nativity"" (Butlin 538). Blake repeated the same basic ""Nativity Ode"" designs, with many minor but intriguing variations, for his main patron, Thomas Butts, in about 1815 (Butlin 542). This later series is presented here. The date is based on stylistic considerations&mdash;see the Note following Composition Date on the Work Information page. When sold at auction in 1852, the water colors were accompanied by the poem, or possibly only the passages illustrated, in manuscript. This now-lost text may have been written by Blake, like the transcriptions in his hand of the passages illustrated still with his ""L'Allegro"" and ""Il Penseroso"" illustrations (Butlin 543).</p> <p>Blake's interest in the ""Nativity Ode"" began long before his execution of the Thomas set of water colors.

The central image of the statue may have been executed as early as c. 1815 in connection with Blake's work on illustrations for Abraham Rees, <i>The Cyclopaedia; or, Universal Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and Literature</i>. The inscribed texts surrounding the statue were almost certainly added at a much later date, c. 1826-27.

Between 1808 and 1815, Blake produced similar (but not in every respect identical) sets of the <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> and ""Nativity"" designs for Thomas Butts (Butlin 529, 542), to which he added the twelve illustrations to ""L'Allegro"" and ""Il Penseroso"" c. 1816-20 (Butlin 543) presented here. Although we can be confident that Butts was the first owner of these illustrations and very probably commissioned them, there are no extant records of such a commission. The dating of the water colors is based on the presence of an ""1816"" watermark in six of the designs and on stylistic features, particularly the high degree of finish with fine brush strokes, indicative of Blake's later style.</p><p>Each design is accompanied by a separate sheet of paper on which Blake wrote in pen and ink a brief title, now considered the verso of each sheet because glued to a backing sheet. The rectos of the inscribed sheets bear pen and ink quotations, in Blake's hand, of the lines illustrated, to which Blake added his own comments on the motifs pictured. These quotations and comments are of course important in understanding Blake's pictorial responses to ""L'Allegro"" and ""Il Penseroso."" The rectos of these inscribed sheets are presented here, each following the water color to which it refers. Because of the backing sheets, the verso inscriptions can only be read with the aid of a strong backing light, but they cannot be photographed. Thus, they are included here in the Editors' Notes, but they are not reproduced.</p><p>As is typical of his work as an illustrator of the works of other poets, Blake paid close attention to the text, but this disciplined approach did not preclude the inclusion of his own interpretations.

The twelve designs for <i>Paradise Regained</i> presented here are on the same paper, watermarked 1816, Blake used for the ""L'Allegro"" and ""Il Penseroso"" designs. Dated by Butlin to c. 1816-20, the <cite>Paradise Regained</cite> designs may have also been commissioned by Butts, but they were apparently either never delivered to him, or returned by him to Blake, since John Linnell's account books indicate that he purchased the designs directly from Blake in 1825.

Many of the designs significantly juxtapose the dignified symmetry and calm repose of Blake's portrayals of Christ with the anxious and twisting energies of Satan. Through the deployment of such postures and gestures, Blake dramatizes the poem's conflict between divine imagination and satanic materialism.

"John Flaxman, Compositions From the Works Days and Theogony of Hesiod",comeng,1817,1817,bb456.1.1.com.100.jpg,bb456.1,bb456,"<p>The thirty-seven plates of John Flaxman's illustrations to <i>The Works Days and Theogony of Hesiod</i> are one of Blake's major endeavors as a commercial etcher/engraver of designs by other artists.  Flaxman began to sketch designs based on Hesiod's poems in the early 1790s, but it was not until February 1816 that he entered into a contract with the publisher Longman &amp; Co. to ""furnish a series of Drawings to illustrate Hesiod"" (Bentley page 556).  Blake had already been commissioned to execute the plates, almost certainly on the recommendation of Flaxman, a friend of many years.  Inscriptions on a set of pre-publication proofs in the Bodleian Library indicate that Blake submitted impressions to Longman between November 1814 and October 1816; the project was completed by January 1817.  Blake, who received very few other engraving commissions during this period, was paid 5 guineas (&#163;5.5s.) for each plate, a total of &#163;194.5s. plus &#163;13.13s. as reimbursement for purchasing the copperplates (Longman's records, Bentley page 558).  Without the Hesiod project, Blake and his wife Catherine might have descended into dire poverty.</p><p>Blake executed the Hesiod illustrations in an unusual graphic style.  Rather than continuous outlines, found in the engravings of Flaxman's other classical compositions, Blake used stippled lines&mdash;that is, lines composed of dots.  It is surprising to see Blake, who wrote in a letter of 1827 that ""a Line is a Line in its Minutest Subdivision[s]"" (Erdman page 783), deploying a technique that divides lines into points.  Perhaps he was responding to the character of Flaxman's preliminary drawings, now untraced, upon which the etchings/engravings were based.  If these were in soft pencil, then stippled lines would be an appropriate equivalent.  It is also possible that Flaxman or his publisher directed Blake to use this style.</p><p>The texts accompanying the Hesiod designs were executed in continuous lines by a writing engraver named ""Jeffreys"" in Longman's accounts (Bentley page 557).  The quotations and paraphrases from Hesiod's poems are based on the second edition (1815) of <i>The Remains of Hesiod</i>, translated by Charles Abraham Elton. </p><p>Flaxman's classical compositions were influenced by, and often understood as recreations of, Greek and Etruscan vase paintings.  His illustrations of Homer's <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i> and of Dante's <i>Divine Comedy</i> were published, or at least engraved, in 1793.  They soon became famous and highly influential throughout Europe.  These were followed by designs for the tragedies of Aeschylus in 1795 and Blake's Hesiod engravings in 1817.  Blake also contributed three plates to the 1805 revised publication of the <i>Iliad</i> illustrations.  The Hesiod plates were frequently reprinted and included in <i>The Classical Compositions of John Flaxman</i> of 1870.  The publisher, Bell and Daldy, reportedly sold the copperplates as scrap metal in 1917 (Ruthven Todd, ""Blake's Dante Plates,"" <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>, 29 August 1968, page 928).</p>",bb456.info.xml,0,,0,

Apparently Blake was asked to prepare wood engravings, a medium in which he had never before worked, instead of relief etchings.  He executed a series of at least twenty-one pen, pencil, and wash drawings; these were probably approved by Thornton.  The wood engravings that Blake produced from them, however, were far less conventional.  Thornton was again taken aback by Blake's bold transgression of contemporary styles and sensibilities.

His first efforts were a small group of wash drawings of the mid-1780s showing Job in his misery with his wife and three friends (Butlin 162-164).  Another version of this subject appears among Blake's emblem series that he sketched in his Notebook (Butlin 201.20), but the composition appearing in the wash drawings culminated in the large intaglio etching/engraving, ""Job"" (Essick V), which Blake listed in his advertisement <i>To the Public</i> of 10 October 1793.  This print may have stimulated Blake's chief patron, Thomas Butts, to commission a tempera painting, <i>Job and His Daughters</i> (Butlin 394) c. 1799-1800 and, about six years later, a series of nineteen water colors illustrating the story of Job (Butlin 550, the so-called ""Butts set"").  In 1821, Blake and his new patron John Linnell borrowed the water colors from Butts.  Linnell traced the series and Blake colored them (Butlin 551, the so-called ""Linnell set"").  Blake also added two more compositions to this later group and added versions of these same compositions to the earlier group, so that both sets now have twenty-one designs.  The Linnell set led directly to his commissioning engravings.  These began as a series of reduced sketches executed in 1823 (Butlin 557); the engravings themselves, with a title page added, were not finished and published until 1826.</p><p>The Linnell set of twenty-one water colors is presented here.  Its joint production by Linnell and Blake and its dating are based on Linnell's journal, wherein he records that he ""Traced outlines from Mr Blakes Designs from Job [the Butts set] all day"" on 8 September 1821.  On 10 September, he again ""Traced outlines from Mr Blake's drawings of Job&mdash;all day,"" and ""Mr Blake finishing the outlines&mdash;all day.""  See G. E. Bentley, Jr., <i>Blake Records</i>, 2nd ed. (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2004) 379.</p><p>Blake follows the general outline of the story of Job in the Bible, but also incorporates into his designs many motifs representing his personal interpretation.  At the beginning, Job and his family attend only to the letter, rather than the spirit, of God's laws.  Job thereby falls under a false conception of God and into the hands of Satan.  Job's sufferings are recorded in the first half of the series, culminating in his horrific vision of a devil-god in the eleventh design.  Job's spiritual education and material restoration are pictured in the second half of the series.  In the penultimate design, Job tells his story to his daughters; the entire family is restored to life in the final design.  Some critics and biographers have interpreted the Job series as personal statements about Blake's own tribulations and the spiritual peace he found late in life.  However appealing this approach may be, it is made questionable by the earlier dating of the Butts series, the basis for all the later works.</p>",but551.info.xml,0,,0,

His first efforts were a small group of wash drawings of the mid-1780s showing Job in his misery with his wife and three friends (Butlin 162-164).  Another version of this subject appears among Blake's emblem series he sketched in his Notebook (Butlin 201.20), but the composition appearing in the wash drawings culminated in the large intaglio etching/engraving, ""Job"" (Essick V) which Blake listed in his advertisement <i>To the Public</i> of 10 October 1793.  This print may have stimulated Blake's chief patron, Thomas Butts, to commission a tempera painting, <i>Job and His Daughters</i> (Butlin 394) c. 1799-1800 and, about six years later, a series of nineteen water colors illustrating the story of Job (Butlin 550, the so-called ""Butts set"").  In 1821, Blake and his new patron John Linnell borrowed the water colors from Butts.  Linnell traced the series and Blake colored them (Butlin 551, the so-called ""Linnell set"").  Blake also added two more compositions to this later group and added versions of these same compositions to the earlier group, so that both sets now have twenty-one designs.  The Linnell set led directly to his commissioning engravings.  These began as a series of reduced sketches executed in 1823 (Butlin 557); the engravings themselves, with a title page added, were not finished and published until 1826.</p><p>The sketchbook containing the reduced drawings, preparatory for the engravings, is presented here.  We have reproduced the full leaves, edge to edge, to give a sense of the work as a whole and to include the numbers top right, possibly inscribed by Linnell or a member of his family.  Also included are the covers that bear inscriptions, one by John Linnell (Object 3), and others possibly attributable to Blake, Linnell, or members of Linnell's family (Objects 1 and 32).</p><p>Blake follows the general outline of the story of Job in the Bible, but also incorporates into his designs many motifs representing his personal interpretation.  At the beginning, Job and his family attend only to the letter, rather than the spirit, of God's laws.  Job thereby falls under a false conception of God and into the hands of Satan.  Job's sufferings are recorded in the first half of the series, culminating in his horrific vision of a devil-god in the eleventh design.  Job's spiritual education and material restoration are pictured in the second half of the series.  In the penultimate design, Job tells his story to his daughters; the entire family is restored to life in the final design.  Some critics and biographers have interpreted the Job series as personal statements about Blake's own tribulations and the spiritual peace he found late in life.  However appealing this approach may be, it is made questionable by the earlier dating of the Butts series, the basis for all the later works.</p>",but557.info.xml,0,,0,
Illustrations of the Book of Job,spb,1823-26,1823,bb421.1.1.ps.100.jpg,bb421.1,bb421,"<p>Blake's twenty-two engraved Illustrations of the Book of Job are the culmination of his long pictorial engagement with that biblical subject. His first efforts were a small group of wash drawings of the mid-1780s showing Job in his misery with his wife and three friends (Butlin 162-64). Another version of this subject appears among Blake's emblem series he sketched in his Notebook (Butlin 201.20), but the composition appearing in the wash drawings became the basis for the large intaglio etching/engraving, ""Job"" (Essick V), which Blake listed in his advertisement <cite>To the Public</cite> of 10 October 1793.

Blake also added two more compositions to this later group and added versions of these same compositions to the earlier group, so that both sets now have twenty-one designs.</p><p>The Linnell set led directly to his commissioning of the engravings, as set forth in a contract dated 25 March 1823. Blake first executed a series of twenty-one reduced pencil sketches of the central designs (Butlin 557). These he transferred to copperplates. Rather than using the customary ""mixed method"" of preliminary etching followed by engraving, Blake used pure line engraving in the Job plates. Perhaps one of his motivations was to evoke the art of the master engravers of the Renaissance whom Blake greatly admired, such as Albrecht D&uuml;rer. The Job engravings are generally considered to be Blake's masterpiece as an intaglio printmaker.</p><p>According to John Linnell, the border designs, unique to the engraved series, were a last-minute addition to the copperplates. Blake also added a title page, perhaps late in the production process. The title page is not numbered, but all the others are numbered, upper right in the copperplate, 1-21. The plate numbered ""1"" (Object 3 here) was mistakenly dated 1828 in the imprint; all the others were dated 1825. Linnell's account books show that the engravings were not published until March 1826.</p><p>Blake follows the general outline of the story of Job in the Bible, but also incorporates into his designs many motifs representing his personal interpretation.

"Illustrations to Dante's ""Divine Comedy""",wc,1824-27,1824,but812.1.1.wc.100.jpg,but812.1,but812,"<p>Blake's 102 drawings illustrating Dante's <i>Divine Comedy</i> were commissioned by John Linnell, the chief patron of Blake's final years. Although Linnell did not begin to pay for the designs until December 1825, at the rate of about 1 pound a week, Blake probably began work on the drawings by the fall of 1824. They were left at Blake's death in 1827 in various stages of completion, ranging from pencil sketches to highly finished water colors. Most show an expressive freedom in the handling of color washes far greater than Blake's earlier water colors. In 1826, Blake began to engrave large plates based on 7 of the designs; these were also left incomplete at his death. The water colors remained in Linnell's collection and estate until their sale at auction in 1918. Through a scheme organized by the National Art-Collections Fund, they were dispersed among 7 participating institutions: the Ashmolean Museum, Birmingham Museums &amp; Art Gallery, the British Museum, the Fogg Art Museum, the National Gallery of Victoria, the Royal Institution of Cornwall, and the Tate Collection.</p><p>As we generally find with Blake's illustrations to the works of other writers, he has paid close attention to the details of Dante's poem. Yet, while faithful to the text, Blake also brings his own perspective to bear on some of Dante's central themes, including sin, guilt, punishment, revenge, and salvation. In several designs, Blake's pictorial imagery, particularly when associated with similar motifs in his illuminated books and their iconography, indicates a critical attitude towards Dante. This interpretation of the illustrations is buttressed by Blake's verbal criticisms of Dante found in his c. 1800 annotations to Henry Boyd's translation of <i>The Inferno</i>, his conversations with Henry Crabb Robinson in 1825, and his inscriptions on the rectos of a few of the Dante designs themselves. But harsh criticism coexists with many signs of intellectual sympathy in the illustrations.</p><p>We have recorded in the Editors' Notes the inscriptions on the versos of the designs. None of these is attributable to Blake; some probably represent at least 2 attempts to organize the designs into their proper sequence. The arrangement of images given here accords with our understanding of the sequence of passages illustrated and varies at several junctures from Butlin's ordering.</p>",but812.info.xml,0,,0,
Blake's Autograph in the Album of William Upcott,ms,1826,1826,bb208.1.1.ms.100.jpg,bb208.1,bb208,"<p>Upcott (1779-1845) was the illegitimate son of Blake's friend and patron the miniaturist Ozias Humphry (1742-1810), who bequeathed to Upcott a number of Blake's works. Upcott was a bookseller, librarian, bibliographer, editor, and inveterate collector, but he was perhaps best known for what he called his ""autographic mania"" (qtd. in Freeman, ""Upcott, William (1779-1845),"" <i>ODNB</i> [http://www.oxforddnb.com, accessed 18 Jan 2014]), which he exercised in his ""autograph cottage"" in Islington&mdash;where he was living when Blake left his autograph in Upcott's album either during a visit just a few months before Blake died, or, more probably, off the premises as the album circulated among the authors and artists whose signatures Upcott sought to acquire. The album may have been at Samuel Leigh's bookshop in the Strand, where Blake (and others) may have signed it: ""On 16 Jan. 1826 he inscribed William Upcott's autograph album 'by the desire of Mr Leigh' "" (Bentley, <i>Records</i>, 369n).</p><p>Upcott seems to have been a colorful character who earned the title Emperor of Autographs&mdash;he owned at least 40,000 according to his obituary. And he owned illuminated works that his father bought directly from Blake: <i>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</i> Copy H (containing only <i>Experience</i>),
 <i>America a Prophecy</i> Copy H, 
 <i>Europe a Prophecy</i> Copy D, 
 <i>A Small Book of Designs</i> Copy A, 
 and <i>A Large Book of Designs</i>. 
 Upcott's copy of <i>Europe</i> and both books of <i>Designs</i> are in the Archive.</p><p>Blake, perhaps ""very much delighted with being in good Company"" (Object 1, lines 1-2), inscribed a striking, elaborate signature with a characteristically Blakean note ""Writ helter skelter like a hog upon a rope"" (Object 1, lines 10-11) incorporating an equally characteristic sketch of a floating male, nude, with arms outstretched. Blake's signature appears just under that of the painter Benjamin Haydon.</p>",bb208.info.xml,0,,0,
Blake's Illustrations of Dante,spb,1826-27,1826,bb448.1.2-1.ps.100.jpg,bb448.1,bb448,"<p>Blake began to compose 102 water color illustrations to Dante's <i>Divine Comedy</i> in the fall of 1824 for his patron John Linnell. From these Blake selected 7 designs to engrave. The choice of subjects, all from the ""Inferno,"" may have been recommended, or at least approved, by Linnell. There may have been plans to engrave more designs, but even these 7 plates were left incomplete at Blake's death in 1827. The copperplates became Linnell's possession, but it was not until 1838 that he had sets printed for sale.</p><p>Like Blake's Job engravings, the Dante plates are pure line engravings without preliminary etching. Although it is difficult to determine Blake's stylistic intentions from unfinished plates, the Dante engravings suggest the influence of Renaissance Italian prints, including the dramatic ""broad manner"" work of Andrea Mantegna, the artist called ""the Dante of his profession"" by Blake's friend George Cumberland. See also the introductory comments on the Dante water colors in the Archive under Non-Illuminated Materials/ Drawings and Paintings/ Water Color Drawings.</p>",bb448.info.xml,0,,0,
George Cumberland's Card,spb,1827,1827,esxxi.1.1.sp.100.jpg,esxxi.1,esxxi,"<p>This small card is Blake's last work as an engraver.  The design and its execution in copper were commissioned by his friend of many years, George Cumberland.  The card may have been originally intended as a calling card rather than a bookplate.  The early history of the plate is well documented.  Blake first refers to it in his letter to Cumberland of 12 April 1827: ""The Little Card I will do as soon as Possible but when you Consider that I have been reduced to a Skeleton from which I am slowly recovering you will I hope have Patience with me"" (Erdman page 784).  Blake's fatal illness did indeed impede work on the engraving, left unfinished at his death on 12 August 1827.  Cumberland's son, George Jr., took delivery of the copperplate from Blake's wife Catherine on 17 January 1828 and paid her &#163;3.3s. for it.  Shortly after receiving the plate, George Jr. wrote to his father that ""M.<sup>rs</sup> Blake sends her Compts with many thanks[;] she tells me that the Card would have been more finished if WB had lived[,] that it was the last thing he attempted to engrav"" (Bentley, <i>Records</i>, page 482).</p><p>Cumberland had sent a copperplate of his calling card to Blake so that he could add a design to it.  This plate very probably already had Cumberland's name engraved on it by a writing engraver.  Even if Blake began with a new piece of copper, a writing engraver may have added the name.  Blake appears to have executed his design with the graver and drypoint needle without preliminary etching.  Most extant impressions are on paper rather than card, in either black or brown ink, and may have been printed after Cumberland's death in 1848.  There are no recorded impressions of the plate lacking Cumberland's name; the copperplate itself is untraced.</p><p>Blake inscribed the plate, lower right, with his name and age, ""A &AElig; 70.""  He may have sensed that 1827 could well be the last year of his life, but took pride in being capable of pursuing his art and craft to the end.  Blake was in fact 69 when he died; perhaps he inscribed ""70"" on the Cumberland card in anticipation of working on it until he turned that age.  At least when considered in retrospect, this most unusual inscription contributes to the elegiac and prophetic iconography of the design.</p>",esxxi.info.xml,0,,0,
Genesis,ms,1827,1827,but828.1.2.ms.100.jpg,but828.1,but828,"<p>Blake began, probably in the last year of his life, to produce an illustrated manuscript of the King James translation of Genesis. The work was probably commissioned by John Linnell. At Blake's death on 12 August 1827, he had transcribed the text only as far as Genesis 4:15. The incomplete manuscript, consisting of eleven leaves bearing text and designs on rectos only, is now in the Huntington Library and Art Gallery.</p><p>Blake began writing the manuscript in pencil and illustrating it with a headpiece and tailpiece for each chapter. Two additional designs illustrate the second leaf of the first chapter. He then began to illuminate the text in green and red, but this work extends only to Genesis 2:5. A few letters, including the initial capital  ""I"" of Genesis 1:1, are also highlighted in gold. It is of course regrettable that Blake did not live to complete his Genesis manuscript, but its present state does offer insights into his working methods.</p><p>Blake prepared two title pages for the manuscript. The energetic version generally believed to be the first (object 1) is followed by the calmer but more complex second version (object 2). Perhaps Linnell was not pleased with the first effort and encouraged Blake to produce an alternative, one more responsive to the aesthetics of the beautiful than the sublime.</p> <p>Blake made a few alterations and additions to the King James translation that indicate his personal understanding of Genesis and his knowledge of the interpretive traditions surrounding the Bible. The most significant textual additions are the chapter headings of Blake's own invention that signify his perspective on each chapter and serve as captions for the headpieces immediately above. The heading for Genesis 4 shows that Blake understood the marking of Cain as a sign of forgiveness rather than guilt. At several junctures Blake added the Hebrew word  ""adamah"" to ""ground"" to indicate the material from which God forms ""Man"" (to which Blake added ""Adam"") in Genesis 2:7. Blake's addition of ""Elohim"" after the plural ""Gods"" in Genesis 2:7 also reveals his knowledge of Hebrew&mdash;an interest he shared with Linnell&mdash;and his awareness of controversies surrounding the different names for God in the Hebrew Bible. As with Blake's illustrations to the works of other poets, the designs in the Genesis Manuscript offer a visual commentary on the text. Perhaps again responding to scholarly debates, Blake acknowledges the repetition of Eve's creation in Genesis 1:27 and 2:22-23 by picturing the event twice (objects 6 and 7).</p>",but828.info.xml,0,,0,
