All of the shepherds are gowned and some also wear cloaks or 
               shawls with hoods.  The figure third from the left is a small child.  He pets a dog.  The central figure (fourth from the left) has his hands raised 
               with the fingers spread.  The old, bearded figure immediately to the right kneels with his hands together as if in prayer.  The rightmost figure, bearded and wearing a hood,  
               also clasps his hands in prayer or awe.  A large flock of sheep extends to the group's left and right.  The sheep appear to be lying down, and many of them may 
               be sleeping.  The host of angels consists of five winged males (presumably Cherubim) in the center with eight females (Seraphim?) in a circle around them.  The central 
               males are gowned, wear large hats, helmets, or crowns, and have swords at their sides.  Each stands with arms raised at 135 degrees with their arms overlapping.  Two 
               of the figures (second and fourth from the left) have beards.  Six of the angels in the circle hold and play instruments, including four 
               harps, a lyre, and a mandolin or lute.  Several of the angels have their mouths open and they may be singing.  Beams of light or radiance 
               surround the host of angels.  A distant view of the Nativity is show between the shepherds and the angels.  The stable is shown with a 
               large deocrative archway through which we see the Virgin Mary kneeling or sitting on the ground with Joseph standing to the right.  
               Though unclear, it is possible that Mary holds the infant Christ in her arms.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="C"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>shepherd</characteristic><characteristic>cloak</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>hood</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>sitting</characteristic><characteristic>kneeling</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>head back</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A group of shepherds appears at the bottom of the design.

The Virgin Mary (right) and Joseph (left) are pictured through a 
               large archway in the stable.  Both figures are kneeling and Mary holds the infant Christ in her arms.  Joseph may
               be praying.  Outside the stable, two winged angels stand flanking the archway.  They may also be praying.  A flock of sheep lies to 
               the left and right of the archway.  They seem to be sleeping.  Dark wash indicates a night scene, and a trail of fifteen stars arches 
               over the stable.  Grass covers the ground below.  The lower half of the design depicts the "old Dragon" of Milton's poem and eleven other figures in a large cave-like hollow 
               underground.  The dragon (possibly Typhon), the six-headed figure, sits with his legs drawn up and crossed at the ankles.  Several of his heads look up 
               toward the Nativity scene.  Four heads have beards, and three or four of these appear to also have horns.  The dragon's right arm is bent and his elbow rests on a rock to the left.  He holds a large scepter in his right hand.  His left arm is bent 
               upward and wraps around his heads. His left palm is held vertically with the fingers slightly spread.  A large serpent or dragon tail 
               encircles the figure and extends upward to the right of the stable.  Moving clockwise, a nude male is seen from behind to the right of multi-headed dragon.  
               He appears to be running or leaping to the right, and he clutches he head with both hands.  A nude male with scales covering his genitals 
               crouches below the leaping figure.  His left arm is raised at 135 degrees and points upward.  His head is turned slightly to the left 
               and he wears an expression of fear.  To the left, a nude male kneels on the ground and leans on the rock to the left with his left elbow.  
               The figure is seen from behind with his head is bent back and turned to the right.  His right arm is raised vertically with his palm up and 
               the fingers of his right hand spread.  To the left, a bald nude male sits with his left leg drawn up and his right leg extended below and 
               to the right.  His arms are bent and crossed loosely in front of his chest.  His head is bent back and turned towards the right.  He may 
               hold the hilt of a sword with his left hand.  The sword rests on the ground to the left of the figure alongside a round shield decorated with blots of lightning.  To the 
               left of the bald figure is a smiling male holding a dagger in his right hand.  Above this is an old male with long hair and a beard.  His 
               right arm is raised vertically and he holds a bag of coins in his right hand.  Above this figure are two disembodied heads with long hair.  
               They may be female.  To the right of these figures is a seated old woman with short hair.  She is partly nude with her breasts exposed and 
               a skirt or gown covering her legs.  Her legs are drawn up and crossed at the ankles with her left foot prominent.  Her head is bent back and turned 
               to the right, and she may be looking toward the Nativity scene above.  Both arms are bent and she may be clutching the sides of her head.  
               To her right is the upper body of a nude female.  She has long hair and scales cover her torso below her breasts.  Above this is the head 
               of another figure with only the eyes and nose visible.  The figures in the lower portion of the design are surrounded by flames.</illusobjdesc><component type="structure" location="AB"><characteristic>stable</characteristic><characteristic>building</characteristic><characteristic>roof</characteristic><characteristic>arch</characteristic><characteristic>Gothic art</characteristic><characteristic>straw</characteristic><characteristic>wood</characteristic><characteristic>wall</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The stable is shown in the upper half of the design.

The nude 
               statue stands facing forward and holds a winding serpent with both hands.  The serpent faces down with its mouth open and 
               tongue extended.  The statue stands on a plinth or altar.  A fire with smoke burns below the statue.  Apollo's spirit emanates 
               from the statue surrounded by fire.  He is upside down and seen from behind 
               with his arms raised vertically (relative to his body) and reaching downward.  His mouth is open and he may be howling.  A large star (probably the star of Bethlehem) is pictured right of his left upper arm.  A female priestess sits in a 
               small cave below and to the right of the statue of Apollo.  Her flame-like hair stands on end and her mouth is open; she may be 
               howling.  Her prominent knees are drawn up and her arms are bent upward and braced against the walls of the cave.  Below the statue, 
               three gowned female priestesses kneel with their heads down.  The priestess to the left bends her arms above her head with 
               her hands together as if in prayer.  One of the prietesses to the right places her hands on the ground, palms down.  
               Below and to the left of the statue are two male figures (lars and lemures).  They both have long hair and beards.  The figure to the left 
               clutches his head with his hands.  The figure to the right bends both arms and holds his hands with the palms facing out.  He wears a crown 
               of laurel (?) leaves.  Both men wear an epression of fear or grief.  A gowned female stands in the distance above these figures.  
               Above her is a stormy seascape.  A ship, or possibly two ships, sink into the waves with two sails visible.  To the right of the statue of 
               Apollo, a spirit rises in flames from a statue near a group of four figures.  The spirit has one leg drawn up and one arm raised vertically and the other at 135 
               degrees.  To the right of the statue stands a gowned figure.  He or she is twisted to the left and holds a stick or wand.  Two female 
               figures (one gowned, one gowned or possibly nude) stand to the left of the statue.  A fourth nude figure lunges to the left with its right leg extended 
               backward and its arms bent and raised in front of its body with the palms held vertically.  A series of pillars topped with a lintel (possibly a colonnade or part of a temple) is 
               shown to the left and right of the statue of Apollo.  Four spirits fly or hover in the clouds at the top of the design.  They fly toward 
               the left with their bodies horiontal.  The figure third from the left has the head of a cow, bull or ox and may represent Osiris or Moloch.  
               The figure fourth from the left has the head of a dog and may represent Anubis.  His head is turned to the right with his mouth open and 
               toungue extended.  He holds an indeterminate object, possibly a pitcher, in his left hand.  Below the cow- and dog-headed figures is a winged circle or globe (the sun?) 
               surrounded by two serpents with mouths open and tongues extended.</illusobjdesc><component type="object" location="E"><characteristic>statue</characteristic><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>Apollo</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>genitals</characteristic><characteristic>standing</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>arm at side</characteristic><characteristic>arm raised horizontally</characteristic><characteristic>snake</characteristic><characteristic>serpent</characteristic><characteristic>winding</characteristic><characteristic>head down</characteristic><characteristic>mouth open</characteristic><characteristic>tongue</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A statue of Apollo stands in the center of the design.

               the soles of his feet turned out towards the viewer.  His left arm is raised horizontally and his right is raised at 135 degrees.  
               Below is an altar to Moloch composed of a large furnace (constructed like a building) and a statue of Moloch with three infants.  Fire erupts from openings in 
               the furnace and also rise to the left and right of the statue.  Smoke rises from the fire and fills the sky to the left and right 
               of the fleeing spirit.  The statue of Moloch is depicted as a king; he wears scaly armor and a crown and holds a scepter topped with a 
               fleur-de-lis in his left hand.  He is bearded.  The figure sits on the furnace with left leg drawn up and his left foot prominent.  His right 
               arm is down at his side.  In his right hand he holds an upside down infant by its right leg.  The infant's arms are raised verticaly

               climbs upward with its arms raised vertically.  The infant to the right kneels facing left with its left arm raised vertically.  
               Below the statue, a nude male infant stands on the altar in front of one of the furnace openings.  His arms are raised vertically.  The child may be a victim sacrificed to Moloch or he may represent the infant Christ.  Two figures, one male 
               and one female, kneel to the left and right of the infant, respectively.  They may be the child's parents.  The male bends or leans 
               backward and rests his head on his right shoulder.  His right arm is bent upward with the palm up and fingers spread.  His left arm

Grass covers the ground below the stable.  Through an archway 
               we see the Virgin Mary partly sitting and partly

               in a kneeling position.  Her left arm rests at her side and her right arm is bent upward with her right hand supporting her head.  
               Her eyes are closed and she may be sleeping.  To the left of Mary, the infant Christ lies supine on top of the manger.  His body is horizontal 
               with his head to the left.  His arms are crossed and rest on his chest.  A halo with beams of light surrounds his head.  Joseph stands above and 
               to the right of Mary.  He is gowned and wears a cloth or shawl over his short, curly hair.  He has a beard.  He stands facing left and 
               bends forward, resting his crossed arms on the bed of straw.  He appears to look toward Mary and the infant Christ.  Two horned cows or 
               bulls or oxen are pictured in the stable to the left of Mary.  Four winged angels flank the arch of the stable.  To the left, a male angel 
               with long hair and a beard stands facing left.  He may be wearing armor and a helmet.  His left arm is bent and he holds a spear.  
               Below this figure, an angel with long hair kneels with his (?) left leg drawn up and foot visible.  He is gowned and wears a helmet.  
               His left arm is bent and both hands hold the hilt of a sword.  This fingers on his right hand are spread.  To the right of the stable, 
               a male angel with long hair and a beard stands facing right.  He wears armor and a helmet.  His right arm is bent and there 
               are indications of a spear tip (partly trimmed off by the right margin of the design) above and to the right of his head.  Though not pictured, he may hold this spear with his right hand.  
               Below this figure, a male angel kneels or sits with his right leg drawn up and foot visible.  He is gowned and wears a helmet, possibly decorated with feathers.  His right 
               arm is bent and rests on his right leg.  He grasps the blade of a sword with his right hand.  His left hand holds the hilt of the 
               sword with the fingers spread.  Two winged, gowned angels fly or hover above the stable.  The angel on the left may be female.  She has 
               long hair and holds or plays a harp with her left hand.  The angel to the right has long hair and may face away from the viewer.  He or she 
               also holds or plays a harp.  Between the two angels, a woman in a chariot (a personification of the star of Bethlehem) and two horses rest on a cloud.  The horses lie facing left with 
               their heads turned to the right.  Their front legs are bent and folded beneath them.  The woman in the chariot is gowned.  Her left arm is at her side while her right arm is bent and rests on the edge of the chariot.  In 
               her right hand she holds a luminous object, probably an oil lamp with a flame or a star above it.  Other stars, perhaps eighteen in all, suggest a
