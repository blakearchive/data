  static pages that are written in HTML and served when a browser requests the page, and a second
  kind created by generating an HTML page from an eXtensible Markup Language (XML) file 
  and a set of instructions for creating the HTML page.</P><P>You encounter the first, ordinary kind in our "top-level" pages
  (such as the Archive home page, project updates, and this help document). But
  when you view one of Blake's works, for example, one of Blake's illuminated books, you are viewing
  HTML pages that are being created from the XML source documents and a set of instructions
  for creating those page.</P><P>The instructions for creating the page in which you view one of Blake's works are
   managed by an XML publishing system called eXist, which combines the XML file with
   instructions written in XML query language (xQuery) and instructions written in
   eXtensible Stylesheet Language: Transformations (XSLT) in order to "publish"
   the file for viewing in the browser. Erdman's <I>The Complete Poetry and Prose
   of William Blake</I> is also published through eXist. The bibliographies, collection    
   lists, and articles are also XML pages, but they are published using XML and XSLT  
   without without xQuery or the eXist database. 
   </P><P>For Blake's works and Erdman, eXist also handles the Archive's indexing and
  search functions.</P><P>These help instructions apply to the published works portions of the Archive, not the
    static HTML pages or the bibliographies, collection lists, or articles.</P><P class="c7">Some users may be interested to know that all XML documents
   on the <I>Blake Archive</I> conform to a set of requirements that are
   codified in a Document Type Definition (DTD). The two DTDs for <I>Blake Archive</I>
   are known as the Blake Object Description (BOD) and the Blake Archive Description (BAD). 
   Other documents (Erdman, bibliographies and collection lists, articles) conform
   to a simplified Text Encoding Initiative DTD (TEI-Lite), but static HTML pages
   do not conform to a DTD.</P><P><A class="c8" href="#top"><I>Table of Contents</I></A><SPAN class="c9"><I>, or <SPAN class="c3">to exit Help</SPAN>, simply reselect your other

    and selected "Works in the Archive" from the main table of contents page.
    Up to this point, all navigation has taken place in ordinary Web pages;
    upon selecting "Works in the Archive," you arrive at the DynaWeb portion of
    the site. From here you may proceed to the index of all of the Archive's
    illuminated books or non-illuminated materials (also known as a
    "Collection" index), and then from there to individual indexes for each of
    the various works in illuminated printing or non-illuminated media (e.g.,
    engravings, water color drawings and paintings, etc.) in the Archive (also
    known as the "Work" indexes).</P>
    The Work indexes provide links to individual copies of the work in the
    Archive, as well as a brief prose introduction and a list of all extant
    copies.

    <P>Note that there are five icons displayed across the bottom of the Work
    index (and that these same five icons are available on many of the
    Archive's DynaWeb pages). The icons are:</P><BR/><BR/><TABLE width="100%" cellspacing="5"><TR><TD><IMG src="../dwicons/home_milton.jpg" width="65" height="80" border="1"/></TD><TD><B>Home</B>: Returns you to the Archive's main table of contents

      At the top left of the table of contents page for the copy (such as
      <I>The Book of Thel</I>, copy F) is a link to the Collection index.
      ("Collection" is a special DynaWeb term, not to be confused with, say,
      art "collection" in the more usual sense.) For <I>The Book of Thel</I>,
      copy F the Collection index is identified as the "Illuminated Book
      Index." The Illuminated Book Index contains listings for all works
      classified as illuminated books in the Archive. Similarly,
      non-illuminated works are contained in the "Non-Illuminated Materials
      Index."

      At the top right of the table of contents page for the copy (such as
      <I>The Book of Thel</I>, copy F) is a link to the Work index. ("Work," in
      our terminology, refers to the title given to the collected copies of an
      illuminated book or other artifact.) For <I>The Book of Thel</I>, copy F
      the Work index is identified as the "THEL Index." The THEL Index contains
      listings for all electronic editions of individual copies of <I>The Book
      of Thel</I> in the Archive.

      <BR/><BR/><P>Each individual listing in the Work index page (there are four in the
      case of <I>The Book of Thel</I>, one for each copy published by the
      Archive) includes the following information: the full title of the work,
      the copy designation, the printing date for the particular copy, and the
      name of the institution that owns the particular copy of the work.</P><P><A class="c8" href="#top"><I>Table of Contents</I></A><SPAN class="c9"><I>, or <SPAN class="c3">to exit Help</SPAN>, simply reselect your

      The copy index presents a list of the plates that make up a particular
      copy of a work. Each plate is numbered in several ways, first by its
      position in the particular copy, and then by its position in the printed
      editions of Bentley, Erdman, and Keynes: thus "<I>The Book of Thel</I>,
      copy F, plate 1 (Bentley 1, Erdman i, Keynes i)." Each line of plate
      numbers is a link that will take you to the main view of that plate.

      <BR/><BR/><P>For ease of navigation, when necessary (as in <I>Songs of
      Innocence</I> and <I>Songs of Innocence and Experience</I>, for example),
      the Copy index also lists titles of individual plates. Thus, in <I>Songs
      of Innocence and Experience</I>, copy Z, the listing for plate 42
      includes the title of the poem, "The Tyger."</P><P><A class="c8" href="#top"><I>Table of Contents</I></A><SPAN class="c9"><I>, or <SPAN class="c3">to exit Help</SPAN>, simply reselect your

      The basic browsing interface to Blake's works in the <I>Blake Archive</I>
      is designed around the individual physical item or "object," such as a
      single plate, painting, or drawing. This "Object View Page" has as its
      main element an inline image of the object, with a variety of options
      presented using buttons, links, and pull-down menus.

      <BR/><BR/><DIV class="c1"><IMG src="enlarge_and_trans.jpg" border="1"/><TABLE width="55%" border="0"><TR><TD class="c11">Object View (in background) with Enlargement window
            open at top left and Transcription window at right.</TD></TR></TABLE></DIV><P>Selecting certain options in the <I>Blake Archive</I> will open a new
      browser window (if a window is not already available) or use an available
      window for the new page if such a window is open. This makes it easier
      for you to compare transcriptions and images (in parallel windows) and to
      view enlargements alongside the inline images or transcriptions. Note,
      however, that additional windows may appear directly on top of or
      directly underneath existing windows--so occasionally you may need to
      drag a window out of the way to see what's behind it.</P><P>Bear in mind that, because some links are targeted to these additional
      windows, it may seem that nothing is happening when you click on a
      navigational element within the main window: in this situation, you
      should check for additional browser windows, which may be minimized or
      iconized on your desktop or taskbar: this is where your results are
      likely to be found.</P><P class="c7">[Remember that you can always tell what windows are open by
      looking at the icons (on the taskbar at the bottom of your screen in
      Windows 95, for instance); clicking on one of those icons will bring its
      window to the top. You should also be aware that windows can be
      manipulated in various ways: they can be moved from one place to another
      on your screen, and their sizes can be quickly and easily changed. When
      dealing with multiple windows, you will want to know how to make basic
      changes. In most operating systems, you can move a window by clicking
      and, by holding the mouse button down, "grabbing" the bar that runs
      across the top of it as you drag the window where you want it. You can
      change the dimensions of a window similarly, by clicking and grabbing the
      edges or corners of the window and then (again holding the mouse button
      down) changing the dimensions of the window as needed. (For more detailed
      instructions, see the Help documentation for your operating system.) A
      little experimentation will make you comfortable with these simple
      operations, and your use of the <I>Blake Archive</I> will be far more
      satisfactory, because it is designed to take advantage of multiple
      windows.]</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><A class="c8" href="#top"><I>Table of Contents</I></A><SPAN class="c9"><I>, or <SPAN class="c3">to exit Help</SPAN>, simply reselect your

    either for purposes of placing them side by side in the Comparison window
    (without intervening images) or simply to conserve bandwidth. The
    impression currently displayed in the Object View Page will <I>always</I>
    be included in the Comparison window. To select additional images for
    inclusion, you may hold down the CTRL (Control) key and click on one or
    more of the copies listed; then click the Compare button to open the
    Comparison window. You may also hold down the SHIFT key, click first on one
    copy, and then a second copy--<I>all</I> copies listed in between the two
    you've selected will be displayed for comparison once you click the Compare

<p>
On the Java site, you have the option of keeping, automatically, a
history of your search.  You should choose this option only if you are
running Netscape 3.01 or higher, as other browsers cannot support the underlying Javascripting that
maintains the history. When you choose the search-history option,
both types of search forms (for texts and images) are presented in
a layout that includes the search history in a column on the left.
This history will store up to twenty searches, and its purpose is
to allow you to refine your search strategies gradually. If you
are looking for something quite specific, you can start with a
more general search and then add additional qualifiers in stages.
If you refine the search to the point where you get no hits, you
can back up in the history, bring up a form as filled out
earlier, and adjust the additional search qualifications.<p>

    At the top of the Image search page, you must make an important choice:

    <BR/><BR/><UL><LI>find objects which contain <I>any</I> of your search terms, or

        <BR/><BR/></LI><LI>find only those objects which contain <I>all</I> of your search
      terms</LI></UL><P>The effect of this choice (<I>all</I> is the default) is to select the
    boolean operator that will govern the rest of your search terms:</P><BR/><BR/><UL><LI>If you choose "objects which contain <I>any</I> of your search
      terms," then you are choosing to combine multiple search terms with OR as
      the boolean operator, so a search with <SPAN class="c10">eagle</SPAN> |
      <SPAN class="c10">vine</SPAN> selected will search for <SPAN class="c10">
        eagle</SPAN> [or] <SPAN class="c10">vine</SPAN>, and will return any
        object (such as a plate or a painting)--that contains <I>either</I>
        term.

        <BR/><BR/></LI><LI>But if you choose "only those objects which contain <I>all</I> of
      your search terms," then you are choosing to combine multiple search
      terms with AND as the boolean operator, so a search with <SPAN class="c10">eagle</SPAN> | <SPAN class="c10">vine</SPAN> selected will search
      for <SPAN class="c10">eagle</SPAN> [and] <SPAN class="c10">vine</SPAN>,
      and will return only those objects (those plates or paintings, for
      instance) which contain <I>all</I> of the terms specified.</LI></UL><P>Image searches use a controlled vocabulary, represented in the image
    search form as an extensive table of terms, with checkboxes next to each
    term. For convenience, the terms are categorized under the headings
    "figure" (the largest category, with some subcategories), "animal,"
    "vegetation," "object," and "structure," and you can jump to any one of
    these categories from the table at the top of the image search form.</P><P>At the end of each category of the long checklist there is a search
    button--clicking any of these buttons (there are several) will submit, at
    once, all search terms that have been chosen from any and all categories of
    the checklist.</P><P>Search results for image searches come in the form of a list of the
    plates that match search criteria, with a number next to each indicating
    the number of hits in that item ("item" such as a plate), with the total
    number of hits appearing at the top of the list. Note that when conducting
    "All" searches (using AND as your boolean operator) the number of hits
    returned is merely quantitative. Thus, if your "All" search is for
    <SPAN class="c10">eagle</SPAN> [and] <SPAN class="c10">vine</SPAN>, a
    <I>single</I> plate with both of these search terms would actually return
    "2" hits--one for each term--even though only one plate containing both
    terms may have been found.</P><P>Clicking on any item from this list takes you to a description of an
    illustration that matches your search criteria. Beneath that description
    there is an Inote button. Click on it and you will get a copy of the
    relevant image in Inote, zoomed to the area of the image that contains the
    component matching your search terms.</P><P>Note that the list of search results can also be expanded to display
    more specific records of illustration and component hits by clicking the
    blue triangle to the left of any search result, as shown here:</P><DIV class="c1"><IMG src="search.jpg" border="1"/></DIV><P>Please note: Image searching is not available for works in Preview

    "and" or "or," by a "phrase" (text string), or by the "proximity" of two
    terms. The default search option is a search by keyword. Text searching is
    not case sensitive; the difference between upper and lower case letters is
    ignored.</P><BR/><BR/><P>In the default "keyword" search, the Archive will search for instances
    of the word you enter in the Text Search window. For the most reliable
    results, it is best to <B>enter only a <I>single</I> word when performing a
    keyword search</B>.</P><BR/><BR/><P>The Archive also allows you to search more than a single word at once.
    If, for example, you enter</P><BR/><BR/><BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE width="40%"><TR><TD class="c15">cat is rat</TD></TR></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>in the Text Search window, you may choose among four kinds of

    see the beginning of the section on <A href="#3b">image searches</A>,
    above.</P><BR/><BR/><P>A "proximity" search allows you to search for two words within a certain
    distance (designated by you) of each other. "Proximity" searches require a
    very specific syntax. Here is the template for how to perform these
    searches:</P><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE><TR><TD><SPAN class="c10">keyword #1</SPAN> within <SPAN class="c10">#</SPAN> words of <SPAN class="c10">keyword #2</SPAN></TD></TR></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR/><BR/><P>Here is an example:</P><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE><TR><TD><SPAN class="c10">heaven</SPAN> within <SPAN class="c10">10</SPAN> words of <SPAN class="c10">hell</SPAN></TD></TR></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR/><BR/><P>This search asks the Archive to find all the instances where the two
    keywords "heaven" and "hell" appear within ten words of each other. You can
    expand the scope of your search by increasing the number of words within
    which both of your keywords must fall. However, because a proximity-search
    "hit" will highlight only the <I>first</I> of your two keywords, you may
    find it impractical to increase the range of your search too much. For
    example, a proximity search for "heaven within <B>500</B> words of hell"
    may yield a greater number of hits, but it may be difficult to locate the
    second (because un-highlighted) of your two keywords.</P><BR/><BR/><P>Please note that boolean operator searches do not search across more
    than one line of text in the Archive's transcriptions. Thus, a boolean
    operator "and" search for "cat is rat" would yield no hits if the
    individual words "cat" and "is" and "rat" were not on the same line of
    text.</P><BR/><BR/><P>One the other hand, if necessary, "phrase" searches (like "proximity"
    searches) can search over more than one line of text in the Archive's
    transcriptions.</P><BR/><BR/><P>The Search Type pull-down menu allows you to select the body of
    materials you wish to search. A Transcription search will search the
    Archive's diplomatic transcriptions of the alphanumeric content of Blake's
    objects. An Illustration Description search will search the prose
    commentary on Blake's images authored by the Archive's editors. A Work
    Title search will allow you to find works in the Archive by entering their
    title, or a known fragment of their title. Note that we have endeavored to
    compensate for differences in spelling and usage between Blake's titles and
    modern conventions. For example, you could find impressions of Blake's
    famous "Tyger Tyger, burning bright" by entering either "The Tyger" or "The
    Tiger" (or "Tyger" or "Tiger"). Likewise, you could access the Archive's
    copies of <I>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</I> by entering either
    that full title or just a fragment (though entering only the fragment
    "Songs" would also find the Archive's separately printed copies of <I>Songs
    of Innocence</I>).</P><P>None of the Archive's searches is case-sensitive.</P><P><A class="c8" href="#top"><I>Table of Contents</I></A><SPAN class="c9"><I>, or <SPAN class="c3">to exit Help</SPAN>, simply reselect your

    Searches</H3><P>The Blake Archive allows you to perform "wildcard" searches when you are
    conducting a Text Search. A "wildcard" is a placeholder for a letter or
    letters in an individual word. It allows you to enter incomplete words in
    the Text Search window. When you use a wildcard, the Archive searches for
    all the words that would complete the incomplete word you entered. You can
    use wildcards in any of the five kinds of searches offered by the
    Archive.</P><BR/><BR/><P>The Archive provides two wildcard characters: <B>*</B> and <B>?</B>.</P><BR/><BR/><P>The <B>?</B> wildcard is a placeholder for a single character in a word.
    For example, if you entered <B>hea?</B> in the Text Search window, search
    results would include <B>heal</B>, <B>heat</B>, and <B>hear</B>. Note that
    a Text Search will not leave a <B>?</B> wildcard empty. Thus, the search
    entry <B>cat?</B> would yield <B>cats</B>, for example, but not <B>cat</B>.
    You can use more than one <B>?</B> wildcard in a single search word.</P><P>The <B>*</B> wildcard is a placeholder for any set of 0 or more
    characters, up to the end of a word. If, for example, you entered
    <B>heav*</B> in the Text search window, among your matching results would
    be <B>heaven</B>, <B>heavens</B>, <B>heavenly</B>, <B>heave</B>,
    <B>heavd</B>, and <B>heavily</B>. In general, it is best not to use the
    <B>*</B> wildcard at the beginning of a search entry. However, you can use
    the <B>*</B> wildcard in the middle of a word. Thus, the search entry
    <B>t*r</B> would yield results including <B>their</B>, <B>Tyger</B>, and
    <B>tear</B>.</P><P>Please note as well that neither wildcard can substitute for an entire

    When you initiate either a text or an image search in the <I>Blake

    through subsequent levels of the site. So, for example, if you've done a
    text search on "eagle" and then you ask to go to the index, the index
    you'll get will be an index of plates that match the search term "eagle,"
    not an index of all the plates in the book. In order to make it possible to
    reset to the default view of the material, we have put a "clear search"
    option in the navigational table that appears (after a search is performed)

    Images on the Object View page of the Java site are displayed by the
    ImageSizer Java applet. The chief purpose of this feature is to allow you
    to look at Blake's plates and other visual materials at their actual
    physical dimensions, regardless of the resolution of your own monitor.
    (Note that the measurements for a given object are always provided in
    centimeters just beneath its image.) In order to view objects at their
    actual size, the first time that you visit the Archive--and only the first
    time--you must complete a very simple calibration process, by clicking on
    the "calibrate" button (as described below). Once you've done so, the
    images on the Archive's Object View pages will <I>always</I> be
    consistently displayed at their true size, so long as you continue to
    access the Archive from the same computer (though you may also choose to
    turn this feature off at any time). In addition, you may also deliberately
    "lie" during the calibration process, in order to set the images to display
    at some particular size (other than their true size) that might be
    convenient to you.

    <P>Because of the way Java applets work, we have had to pre-define a fixed
    amount of space that is allocated to the applet on the page. We selected a
    size that seemed right to us for these images on a typical display, but you
    will no doubt find--depending on the resolution of your screen and your
    calibration of the applet--that images may have a lot of space around them,
    or else may seem to be cropped by the display area. Note that in either
    case if you click and hold the mouse button down on the image, you can drag
    it about inside the display area--panning, in effect. See also the "fit"
    button, described below.</P><P><A class="c4" name="console" id="console"><B>The Button Console</B></A></P><BR/><BR/><BLOCKQUOTE><B>Info:</B> This will open a box that will tell you the image
      resolution, the resolution at which the image is being displayed, the
      size of the image, and any other information that may be associated with
      the image. NB: if you have enlarged the image to a size you want to keep
      across the whole site, this info window will tell you what "lie" to use
      with the Calibration Applet.

      <P><B>100%:</B> If you've used the +/- buttons to enlarge or shrink the
      image, this will jump you back to the original size (or, if you've
      calibrated, to a true-size display).</P><P><B>Fit:</B> This will fit the whole image inside the applet's display
      space, no matter what the calibration setting is (it won't delete your
      calibration setting--it's just a one-time resizing).</P><P><B>Calibrate:</B> This takes you off to another page with the
      Calibration Applet, which has its own instructions (on that page). You
      only need to calibrate once: for the next twenty years, or until you
      delete it, that information will be stored on your machine (via a cookie)
      and used by the applet whenever you return to the Archive.</P><P><B>+ :</B> This enlarges the image (you can also use the plus key on
      the keyboard).</P><P><B>[x]%:</B> This isn't a button, but rather a readout that tells you
      what percentage you are displaying the image at.</P><P><B>- :</B> This shrinks the image (you can also use the minus key on
      the keyboard).</P><BR/><BR/></BLOCKQUOTE><A class="c8" href="#top"><I>Table of Contents</I></A><SPAN class="c9"><I>,
