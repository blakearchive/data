  announce the public release of our next generation site design, dubbed "WBA
  2.0." Over a year in development, this is the first major revision of the
  Archive's interface since the project's debut in 1996. While all of the
  Archive's core features remain intact -- including the color-corrected
  images, high-resolution enlargements, scrupulous diplomatic transcriptions,
  extensive image and text search functions, and the advanced Inote and
  ImageSizer applets -- we have streamlined the site's organization and added
  major new features that we believe will significantly enhance the way the
  Archive is used for both scholarly research and teaching. These include:</P><UL><LI>a Comparison feature which allows users viewing any one illuminated
    print to instantly compare it with other impressions in the Archive printed
    from the same copper plate;</LI><LI>a Navigator feature which allows users to move rapidly across the
    Archive's collections, with a single click taking them from any work, copy,
    and plate, to any other work, copy, and plate;</LI><LI>a Work Title search which allows users to access materials in the
    Archive simply by entering a title, or a known fragment of a title (e.g.,
    "The Lamb" or "Albion"); also a search function for the extensive
    illustration descriptions written by the editors;</LI><LI>a revised transcription layout, including: easier access to textual
    notes; a new line numbering system that accounts for such items as
    catchwords and plate numbers, in keeping with the Archive's documentary
    principles; and the ability to "page" through the transcriptions in
    sequence, thereby allowing a work to be more easily read in its
    entirety;</LI><LI>numerous functional and cosmetic adjustments to the site design and
    interface, many of them in direct response to user feedback;</LI><LI>updated help documentation detailing all of the above features;</LI><LI>and finally, a behind-the-scenes upgrade to a faster server and a newer
    version of the Archive's underlying DynaWeb software.</LI></UL><P>We welcome feedback and comments on any aspect of WBA 2.0. While the
  Archive continues to remain available at its current address
  http://www.iath.virginia.edu/blake/, we are also pleased to announce the
  registration of its domain at http://www.blakearchive.org. WBA 2.0 is
  accessible at either of these URLs.</P><P>As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access
  restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible
  through the continuing support of the Institute for Advanced Technology in
  the Humanities at the University of Virginia, by a major new grant from the
  Preservation and Access Division of the National Endowment for the
  Humanities, and by the cooperation of the international array of libraries
  and museums that have generously given us permission to represent works from
  their collections in the Archive.</P><P>We would also like to take this opportunity to publicly thank those
  members of the Archive's staff who were instrumental in the production of WBA
  2.0: Andrea Laue (Project Manager), Kirk Hastings (Lead Programmer/Analyst),
  David Cosca (former Lead Programmer/Analyst), and Christopher Jackson and
  Kari Kraus (Project Assistants).</P><P>At present the Archive contains 41 copies of 18 of Blake's 19 illuminated
  books (all with newly edited SGML-encoded texts and images scanned and
  color-corrected from first-generation 4 x 5 inch transparencies), plus a
  fully SGML-encoded electronic edition of David. V. Erdman's <CITE>Complete
  Poetry and Prose of William Blake</CITE>. In the very near future we expect
  to release a much-anticipated electronic edition of <CITE>Jerusalem</CITE>,
  copy E; the publication of Blake's longest (and perhaps most spectacular)
  work will render the Archive's illuminated collection complete, with at least
  one copy of every work and multiple copies of most. At that point, in
  addition to continuing to publish additional copies of the works in
  illuminated printing, we will begin to incorporate Blake's accomplishments in
  other media (paintings, drawings, commercial and original engravings, and
  manuscripts). By summer we also plan to have added search functions for the
  Archive's general and specialized bibliographies of Blake scholarship
  (currently listing over 500 entries), and to publish collection handlists for
  each of the Archive's contributing institutions. Future supplementary
  materials include a biography, timeline, and in-depth study guide for
  teachers and students.</P><P>Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick, and Joseph Viscomi, Editors<BR/>
