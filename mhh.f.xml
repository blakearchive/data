            The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of two new electronic editions of Blake's satiric masterpiece, <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>. They are of copies C and F, both of which are in the Pierpont Morgan Library.<lb/><lb/><hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> copy C, printed in 1790 in green ink on both sides of the leaf, was printed and colored in the style of early copies of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi>. It has not been reproduced in color before. <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> copy F was beautifully and heavily color printed on one side of the leaf (with copy E) in c. 1794. It was produced in the style used for <hi rend="i">Songs of Experience</hi> of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> copy F, color printed in 1794 and recently published in the Archive, as well as for <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters</hi> of Albion copy F, also in the Archive.<lb/><lb/><hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> is the only illuminated book Blake did not sign and date; he did, however, pen in "1790" over line 1 in plate 3 of copy F, thereby clarifying the plate's allusion to 1757 ("and it is now thirty-three years since its advent"), the year of the Last Judgment, according to Swedenborg, and of Blake's birth.<lb/><lb/>
            Copies C and F join <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> copy D, already in the Archive. Copy D, the Lessing J. Rosenwald copy in the Library of Congress, is also of bibliographical interest, in that it was printed in c. 1795 as part of a set of illuminated books that were printed on folio-size paper. This large-paper set also included <hi rend="i">America</hi> copy A, <hi rend="i">All Religions are One&gt;</hi> copy A, <hi rend="i">There is No Natural Religion</hi> copy L, and <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> copy F, all of which are in the Archive. It also included <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters</hi> of Albion copy G, <hi rend="i">The First Book of Urizen</hi> copy B, <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> copy H, and <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> copy R, all of which will enter the Archive within the next six months.<lb/><lb/>
            We now have thirty-one copies of sixteen illuminated books in the Archive. In addition to the books, we recently opened a new wing of the Archive, consisting of an extensive array of supporting materials: an updated and expanded Plan of the Archive, a statement of Editorial Principles and Methodology, a summary of the Archive's technical design and implementation, and a list of Frequently Asked Questions. Our hope is that these extensive documentary materials will prove valuable both to our own growing user community as well as to scholars interested in the theory and practice of electronic editing more generally.

a nude couple, perhaps (though not distinctly) female (left) and male (right) respectively, kiss while embracing.  
They are probably intended to represent the "marriage" of "heaven" and "hell" (lines 2, 4, 6).  The figure on the 
right, facing left with body twisted forward, is stretched out horizontally on a cloud; the figure on the left,
facing right but with the body seen from the behind, hovers above a burst of flames.  Above them several other
figures, including some couples, fly upward between the
flames on the left and the clouds on the right.  Above them in turn, at ground level, in a landscape
of leafless arching trees whose roots are visible below ground, as if seen in cross-section, a couple
strolls on the left and a single figure kneels beside what may be another figure lying on the ground.

The front-most figure to the right lies with arm outstretched and bent at the elbow.  Behind the right figure is the head 
and right shoulder of a third figure.  A vine grows in the far lower left corner and a large leaf appears behind the figure 
lower left. Between the two groups of figures is a vine with a few leaves.  Background washes suggest sky, possibly with a

A heraldic vignette announces
"The voice of the Devil" (lines 1-2): three angels blow their trumpets on either side of these two lines.  To 
                  the left of the text, two of the angels—one gowned, the other nude—face up and left;
to the right of the text, the third angel, also gowned, mirrors its companions, facing up and
right.  Beside the angel on the right, a vine, perhaps with one or two leaves and with at least one
loop, rises from the first letter of "been" in line three.  A bird flies to the right of the vine.  Three
leaf-like flags extend from the "d" of "sacred" and the "h" of "have" in line 3.  These flags may
represent the musical notes of the trumpeters.  Below the bird, at the end
of line 4, two figures, a gowned female and a child, reach out to each other, nearly touching
hands. Further down, to the right of line 6, a small figure, its body and arms horizontal, flees from a
recumbent figure on a leaf.  Next to the words "the Soul" in line 9 are eight figures in sundry
                  positions: the first of these—its body horizontal—flies toward two huddled figures.  The figure
facing right crouches or squats, reaching an arm out to its companion.  The other figure sits
facing left with hunched shoulders.  They are followed by two hand-holding figures who hover above
a streamer extending from the "M" of "Man" in line 10.  Next to this pair, three figures huddle
together on some vegetation consisting of leaves and/or vines.  Following the word
"Energies" in line 11 are four figures and two animals: the first animal, perhaps a horse, kicks
up its back heels.  Next to it stand two children holding hands, followed by another hand-holding
pair, a child and an adult.  The latter extends his left arm horizontally, perhaps pointing to the ox
which grazes nearby on a bit of tableland.  An ornamental ribbon, most likely vegetative in nature,
closes the vignette.  Further down the plate, a leaf grows from the "B" of "But" in line 12; this motif
continues in the following line, where a leaf ornament introduces the text, and a leaf-like serif
extends from the "l" of "Soul," closing line 13.  A branch with spiky leaves grows from the "e"
of "age" in line 16.  Following it, an amorphous, horizontal figure hovers above two wispy lines,
suggesting cirrus-like clouds or vines.  The figure raises its arm, seemingly in an effort to make
contact with the adjacent figure, who prepares to leave its vegetative bed.  To the right, a man walks a
small dog on a leash.  An indistinct shape, perhaps a child, is stationed nearby.  Headed in its
direction, a lumbering figure, bearded or blindfolded, walks (runs?) in a contorted position,
viz., bending forward from the waist with one arm outstretched in front of him.  Mimicking his
general posture, a shadow or an anthropomorphic tree arches to the left.  Near the margin between
lines 17 and 18, a small figure is supported by a cane.  Six figures observe a seventh figure one line
down.  With legs slightly apart and arms raised, it appears to address its audience from behind a stump,
staff, or walking stick.  To its back is either a disproportionally large branch with a leaf, or else
the fallen branch of a tree.  Concluding the procession, two horses, the second of which is
indicated merely by some faint profile lines, pull a figure in its cart.  Given its blue coloring in this copy, 
the hatching at the end of line 19 may represent sky.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="AB"><characteristic>angel</characteristic><characteristic>trumpeter</characteristic><characteristic>herald</characteristic><characteristic>playing</characteristic><characteristic>holding</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>nude</characteristic><characteristic>facing up</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>facing right</characteristic><characteristic>rising</characteristic><characteristic>hovering</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Three angels blow their trumpets on either side of the plate's first two lines:

tendril of a grapevine with a
single leaf attached at the end extends to the right margin.  The grapevine motif is reproduced
elsewhere, and various leaves, buds, serpentine vines and/or flowers adorn the plate passim.  Dangling from
the end of line 4 is a cluster of grapes.  Further down, in the right margin, a flock of birds soars on
extended wings.  A detached vine or branch, possibly with leaves, appears in the general space occupied
by the birds, coinciding with one of their wings.  Line 15 is teeming with small-scale designs: An
eagle, lion, two figures, and some grazing sheep appear in close proximity to one another.  Below,
next to "rod" in line 18, a small figure, perhaps a child, peers up at a vaguely anthropomorphic
tree.  Following "fruits" in line 22 is a fruit- or blossom-bearing branch.  To the right, numerous
birds fly above a picturesque seascape, complete with boats or ships, and a tree grows from
the side of a cliff overlooking the water.  Two lines down, a coiled snake faces a leaping

Vegetative motifs flank the plate's first line, "Proverbs of Hell."  The grape leaf (or leaves) to the
immediate right of "Hell" (line 1) reappears elsewhere on the plate: below "Truth" in line 15, and again
above line 17, where it is attached to a looped vine.  Other vegetative motifs adorn
the plate passim: a long, slender branch with leaves or buds follows "contemptible" in line 5, and
some flame-like leaves appear in the right margin above "and" in line 15.  To the left of "Enough!
or Too much" in line 17 is a small sprig of ivy.  Numerous figures populate the plate, all of which
are concentrated in the spaces following the text of lines 7 and 13.  After line 7, four figures are
backed by blue sky.  Of these, two face each other as they hover in the air.  A third figure, adjacent
to the other pair, lies supine(?) on a gentle slope, which resembles a cloud.  To the right, the last
figure of this group raises its arms horizontally and extends one leg backward.  The second group
of figures appears after line 13.  The figure on the far left (right of a vine or leaf) holds a rope or
scarf.  Behind it is an infant or small child, who is followed by a man and woman, as well as two birds.</illusobjdesc><component type="vegetation" location="E"><characteristic>grape</characteristic><characteristic>leaf</characteristic><characteristic>vine</characteristic><characteristic>loop</characteristic><characteristic>spiral</characteristic><illusobjdesc>The grape leaf assumes some prominence among the interlinear designs on this

stylized vegetative designs appear passim: a leaf- or vine-like swirl curves around "As" in line 4. 
A long, slender branch with buds or leaves, recalling a similar motif on plate 8, stretches to the
right margin following the word "contemptible" in line 5.  Two lines down, in the left margin, a
                     small sprig of buds or leaves—perhaps a detachment from the longer branch described above—also
vaguely resembles the tendril rising from the gloriosa superba of the major design.  In the general vicinity of 
the plate's second group of interlinear figures are a leaf (right of "desires" in line 13)

the scene as a whole is said to illustrate the text that continues from the previous plate, which
describes Swedenborg's self-deceptions: he imagines "himself the single / one on earth that ever 
broke a net" (plate 21, lines 13-14; plate 22, line 1).  Beyond this shape, a hunched figure 
(possibly holding a book or tablet) sits on the crest of a wave(?) or a vine.  Following "falshoods" 
in line 4, a figure clad in a billowing garment hovers amidst some vegetation.  One arm seems to point
downward and to the left.  Below, two elaborate spirals radiate from a common center right of line
8.  To the right of "further" in line 11 are several large leaves.  Next to "number" in line 16, three 
birds soar on extended wings.  To the left of the long-tailed bird and below the small, nondescript 
bird are two swollen vegetable forms.  A loop extending from the "h" of "he" at the end of line 17 
coincides with the wing of the largest bird.  Four figures bound the plate's inscription, "A Memorable 
Fancy," on three sides in line 20.  The first figure reclines beneath some leaves and branches to the left
of the text.  The vegetation transforms into loops and squiggles clinging to the margin of the plate. 
Above the inscription, a hovering figure, arm(s) extended, seems to reach for a serpent.  The four-
looped vine growing from the "F" of "Fancy" (line 20) and the squiggly "y" of the same word continue the
serpentine motif.  To the right of the text, the third figure of the vignette (possibly female in this
copy) stands facing up and to the right with arms raised at 135 degrees.  Her head is bent back, and her 
posture suggests that she has just been impaled by the invisible arrow released from the bow of the fourth 
figure, who leaps through the air brandishing the weapon.  Behind him, a vine or snake coils around a tall 
tuft of grass.  Further down, a yellow flower with leaves and/or thorns adorns the space following "words" 
in line 23.  On the other side of the flower, a flying bird or insect appears to
carry a snake through the air, recalling similar motifs on plates 5, 15, and 19.  Vegetable forms
follow, the second of which resembles a flaccid, vegetating worm or snake.  A vine-like form,
colored red and perhaps suggesting a serpent of odd shape, hovers below line 25 on the left. 
Ornamenting the left margin are various other small-scale vegetative designs attached to letters.</illusobjdesc><component type="object" location="CD"><characteristic>sky</characteristic><illusobjdesc>A thin blue wash below line 18 of the text indicates sky.</illusobjdesc></component><component type="animal" location="B"><characteristic>fish</characteristic><characteristic>serpentine</characteristic><characteristic>net</characteristic><characteristic>vine</characteristic><characteristic>loop</characteristic><illusobjdesc>Appearing against a background of blue sea at the end of line 1, a scrolled,

its head resting on its knees at one end of a serpentine vegetative motif.  Completing the vignette is
another figure striding along the wavy ascender of "the" in line 2.  Its position and gestures are
ambiguous: the figure possibly faces right, a scarf floating behind it.  Alternatively, one might view
the figure as facing left, grasping a disproportionally large scrolled shape; the design would then
perhaps illustrate the angel of lines 2 and 3 "embracing the flame of fire."  Next to "Elijah" at the
end of line 4, a gowned figure hovers, facing left.  A winged figure hovers
below the first two words of line 4.  This nude figure, seen from behind, is outlined in red in this
                  copy.  A serried scene of five sundry figures—flanked
                  by books on the right and more books, or possibly vegetation, on the left—appears between the text
of lines 4 and 5.  Each of the figures sits or kneels.  To the left of the first figure is an uncertain
shape, possibly another figure.  These figures are backed by a light blue wash, suggesting sky.  A
small horse leaps right above "world" in line 8.  Following "well" at
the end of the same line, a figure runs rightward, reaching for a small child.  The top half of the
plate is dense with interlinear loops, vines, banners, and leaves, e.g., the vines and/or roots on
either side of the figures populating the space between lines 4 and 5; the looped vines growing
from the descender of "my" and the ascender of "friend," both in line 6; the elaborate curlicues

stag on plate 8.  Just beyond it, a leafless tree arches to the ground.  An upside-down figure personifies the 
"falling" fire of line 3.  Next to it are some hatched lines which, if representational at all, suggest vegetation 
or flames.  Two figures, many of the details of their gestures and positions indistinct, follow "forehead" in line 8.  
They sit facing each other, the second gowned or otherwise draped.  To the right of these figures, another tree(?)
arches right, its leafless branch seemingly pointing toward a serpentine vine that connects with the "h" of "shot"
at the end of line 9.  Further down, a snake (or simply a line?) stretches from "away" in line 12 to the right margin. 
A relatively large-scale interlinear branch and leaf combination ornaments the space beside "rocks" in line 18.  
Hovering above "then" in line 21, a somewhat shadowy figure faces right, its body horizontal.  It extends one arm 
forward, touching the extended hand of a sitting figure.  A group of five figures, possibly signifying the
"gloomy king" and his retinue of lines 15-17, appears after "king" in line 23: the first figure stands
facing right; the second sits cross-legged(?) on the ground.  They are followed by another pair who
stand with arms extended, hailing the fifth figure, perhaps the king.  He walks toward them with
arms outstretched.  Above "his" at the end of line 24 is a large leaf.  Various other vegetative
motifs adorn the plate, e.g., the looped vines growing from the ascenders of "London" and
"thunder" in lines 4 and 24; the leaf extending from the "h" of "then" in line 21; and the banner
