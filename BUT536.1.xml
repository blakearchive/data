               Below and to the left, a figure crouches in a cave with a shackle on his right wrist.  To the right, a figure lies supine with his arms stretched horizontally; each wrist is bound by a shackle.  The head of 
               another figure rises from the flames to the right.  His expression suggests fear or pain.  To the right, a figure sits with his knees drawn up to his chest and his arms wrapped around his legs.  His right wrist
               is bound by a shackle.  The heads of two other figures appear just to the right, over the seated figure's left shoulder.
               The figures are surrounded by fire, indicating hell.  
               Coloring at the bottom of the design may represent the shore of the lake of fire described in Milton's poem.

It is the only design in the Butts series signed with Blake's monogram, a form he rarely used after 1806, and the only one touched with liquified gold.  A lapse of time might also explain the inconsistency of picturing Death (the figure on the right) without a beard, for he is shown with a long, flowing beard in objects 10 and 11 in this series and in all three designs in which he appears in the Thomas series.  Butlin page 384 reports that the verso is inscribed, not in Blake's hand, "drawn for Mr. Butts from whom it passed to Mr. Fuller."  Neither this nor any other inscription is now visible.</p></objnote><objsize>49.6 x 40.3 cm.</objsize><windowsize height="570" width="470"/></physdesc><related objectid="but529.1.wc.02"/><illusdesc><illustration type="plate" location="E"><illusobjdesc>Satan and Death stand fighting with Sin between them.

Raphael's arms are raised at 135 degrees; he points upward with his left hand and points towards the Tree of 
                  Knowledge with his right.  His wings form a Gothic arch over his head.  His lips are slightly parted; he may be speaking.  Adam sits on the left side of the design while Eve stands in the center.  They are both nude.  Adam looks toward Raphael; his arms are bent upward with his hands 
                  held near his shoulders and the palms turned out and up.  Eve casts her gaze down and to the left toward Adam; she holds a large bowl or cup in her left hand and a bunch of grapes in her right.   
                  The table is piled with fruit; two small vegetative vessels (one perhaps an oil lamp with flames) also stand on the table.  The ground below the figures is covered with copious vegetation, including leaves, small plants, and 
                  flowers.  Several grape-like leaves are visible between the legs of the table.  Large leafy laurel plants grow left and right of the scene and lily blossoms spring from slender branches 
                  that arch over the scene.  Small buds or fruit (berries?) also grow among the leaves on both the left and right.  Clusters of grapes and spiral grape vines also grow to the left and right of the scene.  In the lower left corner of the design, a lily plant arches to the left with two of its flowers bending back to the right.  
                  A cluster of rose blossoms rest on the ground in the lower right corner.  The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil stands on a hill in the middle distance.  There are thorns on the trunk and along 
                  many of its roots and branches.  Multiple branches arch to the left and right of the central trunk and bear large fruits and several leaves.  A serpent coils around the trunk of the Tree of Knowledge with its head resting on the 
                  lowest branch on the left.  The serpent is covered in scales and has a crest on the top of its head.  Two horses and a horned cow or ox stand among the roots of the Tree of Knowledge.  A forest of trees appears to the right 
                  of the Tree of Knowledge; a stag leaps to the left in front of one of the tree trunks.  A flock of sheep stand grazing below the forest, just to the right of Raphael's right hand.  Two birds fly close to the ground in the middle distance between 
                  Adam and Eve.  Above them are two palms, an elephant, an ostrich, a peacock, and a third large stork-like bird with a crest.  A (female?) lion stands just above Adam's head, facing right.  Above the lion is a lake or river.  A waterfall empties into this body of water 
                  from a river that winds into the distance.  A male lion lies to the left of the waterfall, facing right.  Mountains rise in the distance above the river.  Two birds fly on outstretched wings above the mountains; two more fly 
                  just to the left of the Tree of Knowledge.  A few lines of radiance appear to emanate from a soft glow of radiance behind the tree.</illusobjdesc><component type="figure" location="BD"><characteristic>male</characteristic><characteristic>Raphael</characteristic><characteristic>angel</characteristic><characteristic>crown</characteristic><characteristic>leaf</characteristic><characteristic>wing</characteristic><characteristic>fire</characteristic><characteristic>flame-like</characteristic><characteristic>arch</characteristic><characteristic>Gothic art</characteristic><characteristic>gown</characteristic><characteristic>sitting</characteristic><characteristic>legs bent</characteristic><characteristic>arms raised at 135 degrees</characteristic><characteristic>pointing</characteristic><characteristic>fingers</characteristic><characteristic>long hair</characteristic><characteristic>curly hair</characteristic><characteristic>facing forward</characteristic><characteristic>facing left</characteristic><characteristic>left foot</characteristic><characteristic>looking</characteristic><characteristic>mouth open</characteristic><characteristic>speaking</characteristic><illusobjdesc>In the lower right half of the design, the angel Raphael sits facing forward and left.
